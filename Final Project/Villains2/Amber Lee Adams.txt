She serves as the antagonist of ''[[Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure]]''.\u00a0\n\nHowever, she tries to make sure that no one steals her spotlight and goes so far as to demand the directors to reduce the dog's part to bark and playing dead and change the musical's title so that the whole thing will be focused on herself. Sharpay sets her up, revealing her true identity in front of her audience. As a result, Amber Lee angrily bursts out of the theater. \n\nShe is similar to [[Sharpay Evans]] back in the High School Musical series, and twice as bad as she is.\u00a0\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{High School Musical}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n\n[[Category:High School Musical characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
