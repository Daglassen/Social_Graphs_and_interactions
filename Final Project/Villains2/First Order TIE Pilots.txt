They serve the [[First Order]] in their conquest to siege control over the galaxy.\n\nUnlike their Imperial [[TIE Pilots|predecessors]] who were treated as expendable, sent into combat in unshielded [[TIE Fighter|TIEs]], First Order TIE pilots are treated as important parts of its war machine. Potential First Order pilots are identified as children and given rigorous training, often within the corridors of warships, then tested ruthlessly throughout their careers to ensure their reflexes, visual acuity and coordination measure up. Elite Special Forces fighter pilots bear red flashes on their helmets, and report to the upper ranks of the First Order hierarchy.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''===\nThe TIE Pilots return in the the film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' as pilots of the [[First Order]]. They will feature a redesign to their uniforms, specifically to their helmets and life-support equipment. Instead of two breather tubes, the First Order pilots will only have one connected on the right side of the helmet.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nFirst Order TIE Pilot.png\nFirst Order TIE Pilot helmet 1.jpg\nFirst Order TIE Pilot helmet 2.jpg\nFirst Order TIE Pilot Figure.png|First Order TIE Pilot action figure\nLEGO First Order TIE Pilot.png|[[LEGO]] minifigure\nFinn and First Order Tie Pilot Helmets Black Series.jpg\nHero Masher First Order Tie Pilot.jpg\nfirst-order-tie-fighter-pilot-red Vinylmation.jpg\nhasbro-star-wars-first-order-tie-fighter-pilot-elite.jpg\nFirst_Order_Pilot_Figure.jpeg\nSW_Tie_Pilot.jpg\nstar-wars-topps-first-order-tie-pilot.jpg\nStar-wars-tie-fighter-pilot-exclu-swcb-funko-pop-figurine.jpg\nFunko tiefighterpilotfirstorderspecialforces.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Sequel Trilogy characters]]\n[[Category:First Order characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Resistance characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
