He is a notorious crime boss that controls much of the organized crime that [[Kingpin]] and [[Mariah Dillard]] don't control. An accident disfigured his face, resulting in a scarred face that vaguely resembles a jigsaw puzzle, hence his supervillain codename. Jigsaw is [[Punisher|the Punisher]]'s arch-nemesis, as Punisher is determined to dismantle Jigsaw's criminal operations. Prior to this, Billy was a US marine under the command of William Rawlings and Ray Schoonover, and was best friends with Frank until Frank found out about his role in his family's death.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nThe Punisher - Seaosn 2 - Billy Russo.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x02 - Fight or Flight - Photography - Madani see's Russo.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x02 - Fight or Flight - Photography - Russo and Dumont.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x03 - Trouble the Water - Photography - Russo.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x03 - Trouble the Water - Russo.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x07 - One Bad Day - Photography - Russo's Robbery.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x08 - My Brother's Keeper - Photography - Russo.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x10 - The Dark Hearts of Men - Photography - Russo.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x08 - My Brother's Keeper - Production - Russo.jpg\nThe Punisher - 2x10 - The Dark Hearts of Men - Production.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Punisher characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
