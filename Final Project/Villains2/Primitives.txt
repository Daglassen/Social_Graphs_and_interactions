Hive forced Doctor Radcliffe to create the Absolution Virus containing: Hive's Parasites (to sway the primitives under his mind control), Terrigen Mist from the Afterlife Terrigen Crystals, and Kree Blood from the Kree Reapers and Daisy \"Skye\" Johnson. The virus' sole purpose was to trigger Terrigenesis in regular humans and convert them into Hive-infected Inhumans, however the chemical mixture of gaseous virus converted them into artifical Hive-infected Inhumans called Primitives.\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Armies]]"
