Her family, and/or herself, may have a butler or two because Bertram said (from what he heard from the other butlers) she was terrible. [[Zuri Ross|Zuri]] doesn't seem to like her, especially when she throws her jacket on her and makes a remark about her age, and Zuri throws it off the balcony. She cares about fashion more than friendship as shown when [[Emma Ross|Emma]] fell down the stairs from wearing high heels and Jasmines only action was to see if the shoes were ok paying no mind to Emma.\n\nShe was mentioned in \"Glue Dunnit: A Sticky Situation,\" where she called Emma, but Emma hung up and the phone got stuck to her hand.\n\n==Appearances==\n*Zombie Tea Party 5\n*Glue Dunnit: A Sticky Situation (Mentioned by Emma)\n\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Epstein, Jasmine}}\n{{Jessie}}\n[[Category:Jessie characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
