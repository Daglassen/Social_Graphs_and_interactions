"[[File:Twincatsrednblue.jpg|thumb]]\n'''The Siamese Twin Gang''' are two Siamese cats that own a laundromat and an illegal underground casino. Though not major villains, these two characters have been considered as Asian stereotypes due to the fact that they own a laundromat and speak in fractured English. They bear a resemblance to [[Si and Am]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''. Both of the cats are voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Siamese Twin Gang, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]"
