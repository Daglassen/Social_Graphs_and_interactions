They are both alien hunters who are obsessed with aliens and trying to prove their existence.\u00a0Last year, at their first alien convention, Merwin showed everyone that they caught their first alien. Unfortunately, it turned out, with Dean adding in, that it was just an ostrich, which made the audience laugh at them.\n\nThis year, they came to the [[Aloha Animal Rescue|animal shelter]] after getting a call from [[Susan Hegarty]] to deal with an experiment (later known as [[Sample]]),\u00a0to which they were delighted and surprised to find one. Also, upon the arrival of [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], Merwin and Dean quickly deduced that the latter was also an alien and tried to capture him as well. However, Lilo and Stitch escaped, taking Sample along with them.\n\nAfter Sample made various\u00a0sounds he had recorded, the two alien hunters found them. When [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived, Merwin and Dean, seeing that Gantu was an alien too, decided to capture him instead. Gantu ran away instead of chasing after Lilo, Stitch and Sample when he thought that Dean's fake weapon was real.\n\nMerwin and Dean followed them to [[Lilo's House|Lilo's house]], where\u00a0the four tried to escape, but Gantu was caught; however, Gantu managed to call a truce and made a deal with the alien hunters into exposing Stitch and Sample.\n\nAt the alien convention, when the two are preparing to expose them, Stitch and Sample escaped, so Merwin and Dean forced Gantu to pose as an alien instead.\u00a0[[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]\u00a0and [[Pleakley]] were also at the convention, with the latter worried that their secret was out; however, one of the spectators believed that Gantu was a fake.\n\n==Trivia==\n*They are the first two humans to see through the aliens' disguises, the third being [[Victoria (Lilo & Stitch)|Victoria]].\n**In contrast to the people who knew, Merwin and Dean tried to expose the aliens for their personal gain.\n*When Susan Hegarty questioned them about dressing up as aliens, Dean revealed that their costumes were made by his mother out of her old trailer, while Merwin made a reference to [[w:c:aliens:E.T.|E.T.]] as a cover-up.\n*The ray gun that Dean carried was made out of toilet paper rolls and aluminum foil, which Gantu mistook for a real plasma-converting pulse cannon 9000 series.\n**At the alien convention, Jumba could tell that Dean's cannon was fake.\n*Merwin's last name \"Finklestein\" could be a reference to [[Dr. Finkelstein]] from ''[[Halloweentown (film)|Halloweentown]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
