He is somewhat insane and preposterous, as he actually wants to eat meat in order to ascend to the top of the food chain.\u00a0He is also shown to be extremely abusive towards his herd, especially his second-in-command Blag.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Wild]]''===\nKazar is a wicked wildebeest who no longer wants to dwell at the bottom of the food chain. He is somewhat insane; he actually wants to eat meat in order to ascend to the top of the food chain, and was successful in convincing other wildebeests. Kazar captures [[Nigel (The Wild)|Nigel]] the koala and reveals to him that a stuffed koala bear fell out of the sky (actually from a plane) and scared the lionesses who cornered him away. Kazar therefore wants prey to become predator and vice versa. He then dubs Nigel as \"The Great Him\". When he hears from his [[Scab and Scraw|lead vulture minions]] that there are lions nearby, he orders his lieutenant Blag to bring them so they can eat them.\n\nKazar then attempts to eat [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]] and [[Ryan]] when they enter the volcano. During the battle with Samson, Kazar loses his right horn; thanks to Samson. Soon, Kazar's lieutenant, [[Blag]], and the rest of the wildebeests (who don't really want to turn predators into prey) turn against him and refuse to help him. Enraged, Kazar tries to kill Samson and Ryan himself, but Samson roars a deafening roar, which causes the walls of the volcano to crumble. Kazar is then ditched by his own minions. When everyone escapes the volcano, he calls them cowardly preys and vowing that he will hunt them down before getting his front hooves tangled on the plush koala's pull string. He sees a giant rock about to fall on him and he can only let out a weak, \"Uh-oh\" before getting crushed by the rock.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kazar's last words before meeting his demise: \"Top of the food chain, Ma! Top of the food chain!\" is a reference to James Cagney's character, Arthur \"Cody\" Jarrett's line from ''{{WikipediaLink|White Heat}}'': \"Top of the world, Ma! Top of the world!\"\n*Kazar's death is somewhat ironic as the plush toy, which he believed was an omen, saved him from the lionesses and he dies when his hooves get tangled on the plush toy's pull string, which prevents him from escaping the exploding volcano.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nKazar profile.jpg|Official artwork\nThe-wild-disneyscreencaps.com-5826.jpg|\"I am Kazar.
