Lynels are recurring lion centaur-like enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== The Legend of Zelda ===

Lynels appear in red and blue variations in The Legend of Zelda, with the blue one dealing twice as much collision damage and taking 6 hits to kill instead of 4 with the wooded sword. They can be found around Death Mountain. Lynels fire beam projectiles at Link, which cannot be blocked with the Wooden Shield, only with the Magical Shield. When defeated, red Lynels may drop either a Heart, a Fairy or one Rupee, while blue Lynels may drop either a Heart, one Rupee, four Bombs or a Clock.


=== A Link to the Past ===

Lynels appear on Death Mountain in A Link to the Past where only 3 are found by the east bridge near Ganon's Tower. They shoot fireballs at Link, which can only be deflected with the Red and Mirror Shields. They can only be damaged with the Magic Hammer, Silver Arrows, a Spin Attack from the Master Sword, or an attack from any of its upgrades.


=== Oracle of Seasons ===
Lynels appear in red and blue variations in Oracle of Seasons. They also shoot fireballs at Link. A Golden Lynel appears in the Tarm Ruins during Winter after talking to the golden-robed Old Man. Defeating the Golden Lynel alongside the other Golden Monsters rewards Link with the Red Ring.


=== Oracle of Ages ===

Lynels appear in red and blue variations in Oracle of Ages.


=== A Link Between Worlds ===
Lynels appear in two variations in A Link Between Worlds, a white-maned type found on Death Mountain and a black variant with an orange mane that is found in the Treacherous Tower. They attack by breathing a long stream of fire that takes three hearts,[verification needed] which can only be blocked with the Hylian Shield.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Lynels appear in five different variations in Breath of the Wild, including the standard red-maned Lynels, Blue-Maned Lynels, White-Maned Lynels, Silver Lynels, and the Master Mode exclusive Golden Lynels. With the exception of the Lynel on Ploymus Mountain, after spotting Link, a Lynel will often refrain from attacking for a short period of time and instead stare him down. This allows Link to escape before it initiates a battle. Lynels exclusively use weapons of the Lynel Gear equipment archetype, of which they are the sole source. The only exception to this is the Lynel encountered in the Coliseum Ruins, which carries a Flameblade when encountered as a Silver Lynel. Depending on their location, Lynels can wield a Sword and Shield combo, a Spear, or a Crusher. They also wield a Bow that is equipped with either Regular Arrows (only at Gerudo Summit), Fire Arrows, Ice Arrows, Shock Arrows, or Bomb Arrows (only on the Great Plateau in Master Mode). Though Lynel Spears and Lynel Crushers are two-handed Weapons, Lynels are capable of wielding them with one hand.
Lynels have a variety of attacks, both ranged and melee, such as shooting fireballs, body slamming, dashing, and trampling. Lynels also have the ability to teleport, doing so to either briefly flee from battle or to give chase after Link. Link can perform a Perfect Dodge or a Perfect Guard on most of their attacks, leaving them vulnerable for counterattacks. He can also utilize the wind gusts created by their fire attacks to glide up and shoot an Arrow at their head, stunning them and inflicting double damage. Link can temporarily mount Lynels either by sneaking up from behind, jumping on while they are stunned, using the Paraglider to drop onto them from above, or immediately after they perform a dashing Sword swipe or charge at Link. While mounted, Link can repeatedly attack the Lynel up to five times with any Weapon without it losing any Durability. If Link's Stamina runs out however, he will be thrown off and lose a quarter of a Heart. Though they can be mounted, they cannot be soothed. If Link dies while attempting to mount a Lynel, the Lynel will roar.
Every kind of Lynel from red to golden are completely immune to all elemental types. That includes the additional damage and the effect an element would normally inflict. It is therefore pointless to use offensives like elemental arrows and elemental melee weapons whilst fighting them. The only exception to this is Urbosa's Fury which does not abide by this rule.
When defeated, Lynels drop their Hooves, Horns, and Guts, along with their Weapons and a bundle of their Arrows. Silver and Golden Lynels occasionally drop Gems and Star Fragments as well. A total of 22 Lynels can be found throughout Hyrule. An additional Lynel also appears on the Great Plateau in Master Mode. Two Lynels also appear in the Trial of the Sword.
Link can buy a Lynel Mask for 999 Mon from Kilton's Fang and Bone shop after completing three Divine Beasts. It can be used to temporarily avoid being attacked by Lynels. Majora's Mask can also be worn to deceive Lynels, but will only work for a short amount of time and the Lynels will attack Link if he lingers too long.

In the Oracle of Seasons book by Craig Wessel, Lynels are incorrectly identified as "Fire Cats".
Even though only three Lynels appear in A Link to the Past, five of them appear in the ending after completing the Palace of the Four Sword in Game Boy Advance version.
