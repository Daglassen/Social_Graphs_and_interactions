Thunderblight Ganon is a recurring Boss in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Thunderblight Ganon is one of the four phantoms of Calamity Ganon that took control of the Divine Beasts. It is found either inside the Divine Beast Vah Naboris or in the center of Hyrule Castle if it is not already defeated. It is responsible for bringing Urbosa to her demise.
Thunderblight Ganon deals high electricity damage. Link can use Food or Elixirs with high-level electricity resistance to prevent taking too much damage during the fight. Thunderblight Ganon has three phases. In the first phase, Thunderblight Ganon will speed towards Link and attack him. Link can simply block its oncoming attacks and then retaliate. Once Thunderblight Ganon's health is halfway down, it will change its strategy and stay levitating out of reach. Thunderblight Ganon will drop metal pillars all over the room and strike them with electricity. Link must use Magnesis to grab one of the pillars and shock Thunderblight Ganon with its own electricity. For the third and final phase, Thunderblight Ganon will behave as it did in the first phase but it will attack much more aggressively than before
Once Link has defeated it, Thunderblight Ganon will explode and Link will be rewarded with a Heart Container. Urbosa will thank Link for defeating Thunderblight Ganon and freeing Divine Beast Vah Naboris by gifting him Urbosa's Fury.
