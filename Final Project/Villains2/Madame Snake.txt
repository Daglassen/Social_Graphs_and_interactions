She is a tall, green-skinned, snake-like mutant with serpentine features who wears a green snake skin patterned dress with a pink necklace.\n\nShe was once an up-an-coming model/fashion designer, until she had an accident involving a batch of experimental shower gel (this incident is never fully explained in the show) which altered her body, and gave her the power to compress her skeleton and mold her face, making her a master of disguise.\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
