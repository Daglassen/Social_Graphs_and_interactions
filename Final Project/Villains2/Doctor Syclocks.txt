He steals rubies from jewelry clocks and uses cuckoo clocks as bombs, and always emits a noisy \"tick tock\". he is eventually found to be a defective clockwork man created by [[Geppetto]].\n\nIn \"[[The Return Of Dr. Syclocks?|A Volta Do Dr. Tictac?]]\" the [[Red Bat]] faces a jewelry thief and when he describes him to [[Chief O'Hara]], he quickly recognises him as Dr. Syclocks. However, it actually is [[Dangerous Dan and Idgit the Midget|Idgit the Midget]] in disguise, who did it as a diversionary tactic to have the police guarding jewelries while he and his partner [[Dangerous Dan and Idgit the Midget|Dangerous Dan]] robbed the bank. However, they are found by the police because they didn't follow Syclocks' Modus Operandi, as they used dynamite and stole more than just rubies.\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
