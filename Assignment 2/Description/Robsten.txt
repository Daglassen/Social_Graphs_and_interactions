Robsten is part of a group of traveling Hylian merchants, with [[Benja]] as their leader. He is stranded at the Kara Kara Bazaar because men are not allowed into [[Gerudo Town]].<ref name=\"stranded\">{{Cite|But then, that must mean... Are you also stranded out here?|Robsten|BotW}}</ref><ref name=\"town\">{{Cite|Apparently they {{Color|BotW Red|only let women into that town}}...And to think we came all the way out here...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> When [[Link]] first speaks to Robsten, he asks whether Link is a merchant or a traveler.<ref>{{Cite|Hey... Um... You're...?|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> If Link says he is a merchant, he says that he is also a merchant and concludes that Link must also be stranded at the Bazaar.<ref>{{Cite|Oooh, I see. So you're just like us.|Robsten|BotW}}</ref><ref name=\"stranded\"/> If Link says he is a traveler, Robsten just explains that he is a merchant.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, I see. Well, we're merchants.|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten then continues to explain that his group wanted to sell their goods at Gerudo Town, but were not allowed in because they are men.<ref>{{Cite|We wanted to make it to {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}} to sell our goods, but we were stopped before we could go in.|Robsten|BotW}}</ref><ref name=\"town\"/> Their leader, Benja, went to Gerudo Town to negotiate and figure out a way to get into the town.<ref>{{Cite|Our leader went to {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}} to try to figure out how we can get inside...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Our caravan leader went to {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}} to negotiate, but he hasn't come back yet...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten says that their leader has not come back yet, speculating that he is still figuring out a way to get inside.<ref>{{Cite|But he hasn't come back yet. I imagine he isn't having a ton of luck...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten feels that Gerudo Town is so close, yet so far.<ref>{{Cite|So close, and yet so far. Nothing has described {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}} more accurately.|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> He also comments that most travelers cannot get farther than the Town because of the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Naboris|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Male merchants can't go to town, and most travelers can't go farther because of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}}...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Robsten while wearing the [[Gerudo Set]], he is shocked to see him and thinks he is a girl.<ref>{{Cite|WOW! {{Color|BotW Gray|{{Small|So cute...}}}}|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten then asks Link if he is there by himself, commenting that the Desert is dangerous.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, my. Please excuse my rudeness. Are you all by yourself in a place like this? The desert is quite dangerous, you know.|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten promises to be there for him if he is ever afraid.<ref>{{Cite|If you feel even the slightest twinge of fear, you can count on me to help, OK?|Robsten|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Robsten while searching for the [[Vilia|man]] who discovered a way into Gerudo Town, Robsten is expressing worry that their boss has not returned from Gerudo Town and speculates that he will not be coming back that day.<ref>{{Cite|Our boss... I get the feeling that he isn't coming back from {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}} anytime soon... I hope he's OK...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It doesn't seem like he'll be coming back today, either...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> When Link informs Robsten with Benja's news about the man who sneaks into Gerudo Town and travels between the Town and the Bazaar,<ref>{{Cite|Wha\u2014 There's a {{Color|BotW Red|man who got into Gerudo Town}}?|Robsten|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|And the boss says he comes here to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Kara Kara Bazaar}}?|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten is surprised and says that it must be true if his boss says so.<ref>{{Cite|I guess it must be true if the boss said so...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten claims to have never seen a sneaky guy around the Bazaar,<ref>{{Cite|But I've never seen anyone around here who strikes me as a super sneaky guy...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> but does recall seeing a pretty Hylian girl at the [[Kara Kara Bazaar#Shaillu's General Store|general store]] who dresses like a Gerudo.<ref>{{Cite|There was that pretty Hylian gal at the {{Color|BotW Red|general store}}. It's unusual to see a Hylian girl dressed like a Gerudo...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> Robsten then wonders where she bought the Gerudo clothes and wonders if wearing them would allow him to sneak into Gerudo Town,<ref>{{Cite|Her {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo clothes}}\u2014I wonder where she bought them... Maybe if I wore those clothes...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref> but quickly dismisses the idea.<ref>{{Cite|Ha, nah. I'm so out of my element with all this sneaky stuff.|Robsten|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Ha! Never mind. No one would ever be that crazy!|Robsten|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter Link calms Naboris, Robsten sits beside Benja and says that he never figured out how to sneak into Gerudo Town.<ref>{{Cite|I never could figure out how to sneak in...|Robsten|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
