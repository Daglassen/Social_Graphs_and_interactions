Later in the episode, when [[Genie]] is about to stop Samir with a jet plane and is getting [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] to show it to him, Nefir's imps load the jet with barrels of explosives. Later, at a cave, the imps trap Genie in a stockade when the jinn sees that Nefir put dancing shoes on Samir to wreck Getzistan. At night, Nefir's imps and Aladdin and his friends play different kinds of music and the magic dancing shoes explodes. Samir then puts the dancing shoes on Nefir and his imps.\n\n==[[Mission: Imp Possible]]==\nNefir's imps are only seen at the beginning of the episode. Nefir makes them fly across a lake to get a golden silk, but they keep running into obstacles and Nefir thinks they're just being lazy so, he discharges them and decides to find [[Genie|someone]] else to do the work for him.\n\n==[[The Way We War]]==\nNefir and his imps visit [[Agrabah]]. They are first seen building a giant fan in front of the palace. They show everyone that it stops the cheese the [[Odiferous|Odiferans]] are throwing from hitting them. They then make [[the Sultan]] a new outfit. Nefir and his imps then enter a tent [[Prince Uncouthma|Uncouthma]] and the other Odiferans are in. The imps rebuild a catapult into a machine that fires huge diamond-tipped javelins. After Nefir tells Uncouthma that Aladdin stole his Most Sacred Crock of Cheese and the barbarian is about to bash the Street rat, he tells the crocodile-headed imp to follow Uncouthma so that he will know what happened. The crocodile-headed imp sees that Aladdin and Uncouthma are talking about Nefir and he flies off to tell him. When Nefir and the Sultan enter a tower, two of the imps lift it up. [[Jasmine]] goes to the imps and demands them to lower the tower, but they laugh at her. The princess then makes [[Rajah]] chase them away for good.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n==Trivia==\n*The Hippo-headed Imp appears to have normal human skin color in ''Never Say Nefir'' but in the rest of his episode appearances, he has gray skin color matching the color of his hippo head.\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Hippopotamuses]]\n[[Category:Crocodiles]]\n\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Warthogs]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n\n\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Mythology]]\n[[Category:Demons]]"
