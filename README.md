**Project 1** <br>
Basic visualization methods of networks

**Project 2** <br>
Part 0: Building the network <br>
To create our network, we downloaded the Zelda Wiki pages for all characters in BotW (during Week 4) and linked them via the hyperlinks connecting pages to each other. To achieve this goal we have used regular expressions <br>
Part 1: Network visualization and basic stats <br>
Part 2: Word-clouds <br>
Create a word-cloud for each race of the five champions of Hyrule (i.e. Hylian, Zora, Goron, Gerudo, and Rito) according to either TC-IDF <br>
Part 3: Communities and TF-IDF <br>
Part 4: Sentiment of communities <br>



**Project 3** <br>
The motivation: When we think of Disney films, we feel a rush of nostalgia, as if we were watching one of those with a bowl of cereal on a Sunday morning. Therefore, it was an easy decision to take a further look into the villains of Disney, and explore the characters in a new light. <br>

The dataset: The dataset was extracted from the Disney Fandom Wiki webpage, and it contains all the character villains from Dinsey. That includes characters from different universes, e.g Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, Walt Disney and other. After having built and visualized the network, we decided to narrow the scope and maintaining at least some possibility of analysing information about the dataset, do to lack of internal connections in the whole Disney Villains dataset. We then chose to select a subset of the data, that represents one universe, Marvel. <br>

The goal: The goal of the project was to find something interesting in the dataset. <br>
