He faces off against Luke and his partner in a game of paintball, alongside his brother Derk. Unfortunately, they ultimately end up losing to their team, him being the last one to get eliminated from the two of them. Trevor is just as selfish as his older brother, and it's possible that Derk influenced him to be a bully since he appears to be one himself.\n==Appearance & History==\nTrevor is a chubby kid with a big collection of greasy-looking hair. The only clothes he was seen wearing was a gladiator battleskirt in the paintball battle, alongside other more regular clothes under another circumstance.\n\nTrevor met his defeat in the paintball battle when his gun suddenly stopped working, causing Luke to jump in and easily defeat him with one shot, splattering onto his chest and across a part of his face. Trevor said, \"Epic fail!\" before leaving.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Jessie characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
