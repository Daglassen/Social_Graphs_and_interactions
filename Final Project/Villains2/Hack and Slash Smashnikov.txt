They are twin wolves who served as [[Flintheart Glomgold]]'s employees/henchmen, along with [[Gabby McStabberson]]. Hack is the shorter of the duo wearing a green jacket and glasses, while Slash is the taller one with a black jacket, a scar on his face and black gloves, with both wearing helmets.\n==Trivia==\n*Their choice of weapons are a play on their names; for instance, an axe typically \"hacks\" and daggers are known to \"slash\".\n*Their last names, along with their accents, suggest that the two are of Russian descent.\n*They are featured with the other villains in the show's [[DuckTales Theme|intro]].\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
