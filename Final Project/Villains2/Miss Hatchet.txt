She is voiced by [[April Winchell]].\n==History==\n\nFeared by many students (as evidenced by the instant cowering when she's near outside the library), Miss Hatchet is infamous amongst the students for her strict actions in regards to her library's books. This was evidenced with [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]], when her friend [[Ron Stoppable]] lost one of her books unknowingly during a mission. Miss Hatchet then put Kim through the proverbial grinder as punishment until Ron returned the book.\n\nShe was last seen accidentally opening what she thought was Kim's missing library book... in reality, it was an ancient text that Ron had stolen from [[Monkey Fist]]. Ron still had Kim's missing book. What happened to Miss Hatchet afterwards is unknown.\n==Trivia==\n\n*She is one of the few staff members that can be seen at Middleton High.\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hatchet}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
