They looked in Norway a mystical object that was lost long ago. They used the power of mystical object object known as the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction. When the Schutzstaffels visited the HYDRA's facilities they realized that Red Skull sought the world domination. As Schutzstaffels learned about his plan, Schmidt decided to kill them.\n\nWhen Schmidt learned that Americans with the help of Abraham Erskine would create a super soldier, he sent Heinz Kruger that if the experiment was a success, Kruger would to kill Erskine and retrieve the perfect formula for him. When Kruger was captured by Steve Rogers, he decided to commit suicide. After Steve Rogers managed to defeat an entire army, the SSR teams up with Captain America and the Howling Commandos to destroy the different HYDRA's facilities around Europe. Captain America defeated the Red Skull when this one when to launch a super bomb on New York City. With Schmidt defeated, it was believed that HYDRA was disbanded.\n\n====''[[The Avengers]]''====\nHYDRA is mentioned, when Steve Rogers discovers several cases of HYDRA weapons aboard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]]. These weapons and technology are kept by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for their program \"Phase 2\", which involves reactivating the HYDRA weapons with the Tesseract for use against super-powered or other-worldly forces. \n\nRogers also mentions during a meeting that [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] should study Loki's Staff while hunting for the Tesseract, as it functions similar to HYDRA's weapons.\n\n====''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''====\n{{Quote|Out of the Shadows Into the Light HYDRA|Coded message for HYDRA sleeper agents}}\nIn \"0-8-4\", Agent Phil Coulson's team travels to Peru to investigate an \"0-8-4\", an unknown object of concern to S.H.I.E.L.D. The object is an anachronistically advanced metal device in an ancient pyramid. Coulson's team eventually discovers that it is a Tesseract energy-powered weapon designed by surviving Nazi/HYDRA scientists who escaped Allied justice after WWII and were recruited by Peru. A team of Peruvian military police attempts to kill the team in order to retrieve the device, but Coulson's ingenious team members foil them. In the end, the 0-8-4 is deemed too dangerous to be allowed to exist, and it blasted off on a rocket into the Sun.\n\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 1x17 - Turn, Turn, Turn - Garrett, Fitz, Coulson and May.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Garrett reveals his true allegiance.]]\nIn Turn, Turn, Turn is revealed that there HYDRA agents posing as SHIELD agents.

Later, Bakshi informs Whitehall that Creel is in possession of the [[Obelisk]].\n\nIn \"A Fractured House\", a group of mercenaries led by Marcus Scarlotti attacked the United Nations facilities, while the General Talbot gave a speech. After the attack, Coulson sends Morse, May, and Hunter to Okinawa, Japan to get information about the artifacts used during the attack. In Okinawa, Toshiro Mori and his men faces Morse, Hunter, and May because Mori had learned Morse true loyalty. Meanwhile, Marcus Scarlotti kills the agent Walters because she found out that Julien Beckers was a HYDRA agent. Later, Hunter, May, and Morse manages to capture Scarlotti and his group of mercenaries.

After forty-four years in prison, the Secretary Pierce sends two agents to the Rat to free him.\n\n[[File:HYDRACouncil.png|thumb|250px|Biannual gathering between HYDRA leaders.]]\nIn \"Aftershocks\", After the unexpected death of Daniel Whitehall, HYDRA leaders met to decide who would be the new American commander. List told the others that the person who destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. would be the replace of Whitehall. Later, Coulson and his team pretend to be ambushed by HYDRA agents so Bakshi believe he was free. Bakshi met with Octavian bloom to inform him that he was almost killed presumably by the Baroness, the Banker and Sheikh. They called List, who informed them that he nor Baron Wolfgang von Strucker placed a kill-order on him or Sunil Bakshi. With this information, Bloom decided to send a kill order on the others three members of the HYDRA Council. Suddenly, Morse and Hunter entered to Bloom's mansion killing everyone, including Bloom. Bakshi then realized it was all a plan of SHIELD, in order that they kill each other.\n\n[[File:Bakshi Orders.png|thumb|left|250px|Bakshi orders to capture Lincoln Campbell and Deathlok.]]\nGrant Ward and Phil Coulson sent Sunil Bakshi to meet with Doctor List, the right hand of Baron Strucker. List distrusted of Bakshi because it was the only one who survived the slaughter of the leaders of HYDRA caused by SHIELD. But Bakshi using his talent managed to convince him, and also he offered Deathlok to List in order to experiment on him. List informed Bakshi about their last experiments and that they would go to capture gifted people before going with Strucker. Bakshi, Deathlok and others HYDRA agents broke into the building where they were Skye and Calvin Zabo. Deathlok pretended capture Lincoln Campbell, however, Bakshi ordered the other agents to capture the two.\n\nHaving captured Mike Peterson and the Inhuman Lincoln Campbell, HYDRA took them to their base in the Arctic where Doctor List would perform experiments on them both. Here, Bakshi and List discussed how they both missed [[Daniel Whitehall]] and the twins were the only survivors of his experiments. However, while List led the experiments, Coulson and his team arrived with the mission to rescue both of them. As the base was under attack, List was taken by operatives, who would take him to [[Sokovia]] where he would met with Baron Strucker.\n\nA few days later, after the fall of HYDRA at the hands of the Avengers, the organization was in chaos because its leaders had been killed during and after the battle. The ex-double agent, [[Grant Ward]] called Kebo, one of the operatives was still active. Ward informed him that he was now in charge, but he refused to follow his orders which caused that Ward hit him against the table, leaving him unconscious. Seeing this, the other agents were happy to cooperate with their new leader.\n\nHYDRA succeeded their mission to bring Hive back to Earth as the Dark Inhuman possessed Ward's corpse.\n\nIn retaliation for Hive killing his daughter, Gideon Malick gave S.H.I.E.L.D. information on HYDRA, reducing it to the small facility run by general Hale and her daughter [[Ruby Hale|Ruby]]. However, after their demises, HYDRA had been permanently destroyed.\n\n====''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''====\n{{Quote|HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom.

After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded, and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew, a beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D. For 70 years, HYDRA has been secretly feeding crises, reaping war.

HYDRA is now under the leadership of senior S.H.I.E.L.D. member [[Alexander Pierce]] and various S.T.R.I.K.E. members. Two years after the Battle of New York, Nick Fury presented the Project Insight to World Security Council. However, HYDRA's agents took control of the project and so use it to eliminate potential threats to them. Suspecting that something strange was happening, Fury asked Pierce to delay the launch, Pierce agreed. After learning that Fury used Georges Batroc to access the Lemurian Star and get information about Project Insight, Pierce sent the Winter Soldier to assassinate him.\n\nAs Rogers did not yield information about Fury, Pierce begins a manhunt for Captain America. Meanwhile, Rogers and Romanoff were at Camp Lehigh find information about Project Insight. Here they discover that Arnim Zola was still alive. Zola tells them how HYDRA grew as parasite into SHIELD for years.\n\nHe relayed the plans to Captain America, while secretly transmitting their location in an attempt to ensure his death. Zola tells Cap that is better this way because they both are men out of time. After the constant failure of Strike, Pierce sent Winter Soldier to kill Black Widow and Captain America. Although Winter Soldier failed in his mission, Rumlow and his men captured Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson (eventually escaped with the help of Maria Hill). Later, Rogers reveals that Alexander Pierce and STRIKE are members of HYDRA, which resulted in a battle between the two factions.\n\nAfter stopping HYDRA for the final time, Fury implies that some members of HYDRA managed to escape under cover. This was later confirmed in a mid-credits scene where [[Baron Strucker]] had gained possession of the [[Chitauri Scepter|chitauri scepter]], viewing it as such an asset that Strucker was unconcerned with the other cells and bases being exposed and taken out. He also was revealed to have Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch locked in separate adjoining cells with plans for them.\n\n====''Avengers: Operation HYDRA''====\n[[File:OperationHYDRA14.png |thumb|250px|HYDRA's troops led by Jensen attacks the Avengers.]]\nDoctor Jensen was stationed at Port Sudan experimenting with Chitauri technology. The Avengers arrived to the location of her laboratory after being informed by [[Black Widow]]. Her troops fought fiercely; however the Avengers easily defeated them. With the battle all but lost, Jensen took a Chitauri weapon to face the Avengers. When she was defeated by the Avengers, Jensen did not understand why she was defeated because she had the powers of the gods.\n\n====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====\n{{Quote|Report to your stations immediately.

Coulson gave this information to Maria Hill, who gave it to the Avengers. Getting this information, the Avengers went to Sokovia to retrieve Loki's Scepter and capture HYDRA's last leader, Baron Strucker. Despite having advanced weaponry, the HYDRA soldiers were no match for their attackers. List asked Strucker send the twins but he refused because they were not yet ready. However, Wanda and Pietro went to the battlefield to fight against the \"invaders\". Knowing they would not win, Strucker ordered List eliminate all information about their experiments. Eventually, the Avengers broke into the base where Captain America captured Strucker and Iron Man killed List. After killing List, Iron Man found Strucker's lab and retrieved the scepter after seeing a vision caused by [[Scarlet Witch]].\n\n[[File:Dead Strucker.png|thumb|left|250px|Strucker was assassinated in his cell by Ultron.]]\nWith the battle ended, Baron Strucker and many HYDRA operatives were handed over to NATO. Days later, Ultron, an AI created by Tony Stark broke into Srucker's cell and asked him about the location of one of his associates named [[Ulysses Klaw]], who possessed vast amounts of [[Vibranium]]. After getting the information he needed, Ultron proceeded to kill Strucker and write with his blood the word \"PEACE\" as a direct message to the Avengers.\n\n====''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''====\nTwo months later after the fall of HYDRA, Mitchell Carson a former head of defense of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] attended the presentation of [[Darren Cross]] carried out at Pym Technolofies facilities.
