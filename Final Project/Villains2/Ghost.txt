She\u00a0appears as the main antagonist of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''.\n\nGhost was created by David Michelinie and Bob Layton. \n\n==Personality==\nGhost's main goal is to save herself from an unspeakable fate, and her determination to do so is such that she will endanger small children and manipulate the [[Quantum Realm]]. She can also get emotional, even though she has good reason to. Ghost is also very perceptive, something demonstrated by how she calmly interrogated Ant-Man, Wasp, and Dr. Hank, before speaking in a firm, biting tone and then speaking aggressively when things became more serious. After she was saved, however, she came to see her own life as worthless, thinking she deserved to die for what she had done to prevent just that, though her consolation with her adopted father seems to have mitigated this somewhat.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===\nGhost was an enemy of [[Iron Man]]'s who had fought him several times in the past. However, after one of [[Ultron]]'s failed schemes to destroy the world resulted in Terrigen Mists being released throughout the world, causing people with dormant Inhuman genes to undergo Terrigenesis and become Inhumans. It turned out that Morley was one of those many people, and upon emerging from the Terrigen cocoon, found that he had obtained actual phasing powers, no longer needing to do so with his tech.\n\nIn \"The Kids are Alright\", Ghost hatches a scheme to steal [[F.R.I.D.A.Y.]] and sink [[Avengers Tower]]. He did so by hacking into the tower's systems and tasing [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]] and [[Hawkeye]].\n\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''====\nGhost appears in ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' as the main antagonist alongside her adopted father, [[Bill Foster]]. The daughter of scientist Elihas Starr, a colleague of [[Hank Pym]], Ava was affected with quantum instability following a disaster involving a Quantum Tunnel created by her father, which ended up killing them. Her condition caused her to periodically phase out of existence. While with a specialized suit, she could control and even utilize this, which was provided by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. However, S.H.I.E.L.D. took advantage of Ava's condition, making her an convert operative not unlike [[Black Widow]] and [[Hawkeye]]. Eventually following [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|the organization's desolution]], Ava came under the care of Dr. Bill Foster, who provided her the means to prolong her life and resources needed in order to stabilize herself. However, what she needed were energies from the Quantum Realm.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the comics, Ghost was a villain of [[Iron Man]] who became a thief after being exploited and having their life ruined by corporate-executives and white-collar criminals.  His powers came from his suit and technology which were all of his own design and being constantly upgraded to be on parr with Iron-Man's tech.\n*Ghost is one of the few antagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to be redeemed.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nAM&TW promotional still 1.jpg\nAnt-Man and the Wasp 64.jpg\nAnt-Man and the Wasp 123.jpg\nAMATW Promotional 21.jpg\nAMATW Promotional 10.jpg\nAnt-Man and the Wasp 30.jpg\nAMATW Character Posters 06.jpg\nGhost POP.jpg\nGhost Invisible POP.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Ant-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
