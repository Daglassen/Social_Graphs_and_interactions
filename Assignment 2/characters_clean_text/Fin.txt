Fin is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Fin is a Hylian who can be found camped out on Trilby Plain, just off the road. He is a member of the Shield Breakers, a Shield Surfing gang. Initially, he's seen scoping out the hill, where he believes Russ is slacking off.
Upon talking to Fin, he asks Link if he is up for Shield Surfing. Fin points him to his best friend, Russ, under a tree on top of the hill. He then wants to know if Link will head up. After several rounds of Shield Surfing, Fin calls Link a junkie.
If Link agrees to head up, Fin is excited and remarks that Shields were made for surfing. However, if Link refuses, Fin accuses him and cramping his vibe and says to come back after he chills out.
Link will be automatically transported to the top of the hill when he agrees. One there, Russ apologizes to Link for Fin pressuring him into shield-surfing and offers him Shields to buy.
