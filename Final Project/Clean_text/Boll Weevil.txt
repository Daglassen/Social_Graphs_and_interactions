pay off Merriweather debt enabling him keep Milady this time terms his appearance Weevil depicted like the typical Southern tycoon has very apparent prominent Southern accent and even dresses like old time plantation owner has very commanding presence and carries himself with air that would tell anyone show him decent respect Judging only his appearance would think that all this would make him come off like refined Southern gentleman However immediately upon his introduction this clearly shown not the case terms his personality Weevil portrayed evil Southern tycoon rather than gentle very brash and ill tempered when interacting with people shown his bullying nature toward Merriweather and borderline abusive nature manhandling Webby and Milady can also presumed that has evil streak mile wide given his plans work Milady practically death his oat fields something that also shows his disrespect toward most animals also shown that can downright terrifying even the sound his voice particularly when takes more threatening tone can scare Milady The only modicum respect that starts show her when thinks that she about make him rich with victory the Kenducky Derby which she herself destroys blowing the race just have her picture taken the last second What truly cements Weevil evil nature however his willingness physically hurt others While not shown doing any such thing throughout the episode does nearly harm Webby when first meets her the point that angers Milady and attempts harm her and Milady when chases them his truck early the episode addition after chasing down Huey Dewey and Louie the racetrack threatens their lives well indicating that has every intention harming them for making him chase them for nothing Ironically despite only appearing episode and not physically harming any the heroes Weevil still ended being the McDuck family most fearsome threatening adversaries just virtue his very strong presence Specifically was Webby most determined enemies with only appearance Weevil almost fittingly named after the tiny black cotton eating Mexican insect the same name Just the actual boll weevil considered evil for its part eating farmers cotton Weevil himself considered evil for taking Milady from Merriweather"
