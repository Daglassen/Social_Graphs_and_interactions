He was later taken to The Big House, without knowledge of The Big House he tried to escape the vicinity but Ant-Man prevented him from escaping realizing what The Big House really is. In his holding cell he is itching to escape but then he calms down when the Mad Thinker told him about the four supervillain prisons on the planet and that a system shutdown would free them soon.\n\nWhen the breakout happens Whirlwind escaped The Big House and knocked some S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents out along the way. He later found Ant-Man. He provoked him by hurting the Wasp. He then punched him to a ledge and grabbed hold of him. As Griffin tried to attack Ant-Man he shrinked himself and attacked Whirlwind instead.\n\nOnce being taken in to 42 for yet another crime, the power started flickering on and off.

Later in \"Me Time\", Whirlwind appears in the episode's opening. Hired by Doctor Octopus, Whirlwind causes havoc in town until Spider-Man fights him. Spider-Man defeats Whirlwind by webbing off his helmet and knocking him out with it. Spider-Man, due to becoming dizzy in the tornado, throws up in the helmet and that Nick Fury might want to have the helmet washed before returning it to Whirlwind. Norman Osborn later watches footage of Spider-Man's fight with Whirlwind.\n\n===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===\nHe was among the many villains that Scott Lang had sold technology to make money.
