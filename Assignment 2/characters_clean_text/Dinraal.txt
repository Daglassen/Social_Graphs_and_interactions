Dinraal is a Dragon in Breath of the Wild.


== Characteristics ==

Dinraal is one of three roaming Dragons in Hyrule Kingdom, the others being Naydra and Farosh. It can be found roaming the Eldin region, Great Hyrule Forest, Akkala, and Hebra. Dinraal guards the Spring of Power. While it cannot be defeated, it does not actively try to harm Link. However, if Link gets too close, he will be seared by the fire emanating from its body, unless he possesses a full set of Fireproof Armor that has been enhanced twice by a Great Fairy. Dinraal will drop different Materials if Link shoots it with a Bow. Depending on what part of Dinraal is hit, it will drop a Shard of Dinraal's Horn, Shard of Dinraal's Fang, Dinraal's Claw or Dinraal's Scale.
Dinraal's Scale can be offered at the Spring of Power to unlock a hidden Ancient Shrine.


=== Schedule ===
Note that these times will vary, but the difference between the timestamps are always the same. Dinraal generally appears between 11:00 PM to 05:00 AM.


== Nomenclature ==
Dinraal's name is a reference to the golden goddess Din. Its Japanese and various localized names seem to derive from Eldin, which itself comes from Din also.
