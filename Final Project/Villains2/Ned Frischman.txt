He has attempted to take over the world twice, once using Gameguys, the other time using jokes.\n\n==Background==\nNed Frischman was a nerd and social misfit among his co-worker who works at a pants factory in the year [[1994]]. Longing for companionship but every time he attempts to break out of his shell, his peers would consider him a nerd and loser. Ned swore he'd have his revenge on mankind with the power he gains with a radioactive zipper which he uses to travel back into time. Ned decides of using the power of his modern mind to take over the ancient world.\n\n==Role in the series==\nNed first appeared in the episode \"Ned Frischman: Man of Tomorrow\", after discovering a magical [[Time Zipper]],\u00a0Ned travels back in time and tries to take over the ancient world using Gameguys (video games). When everyone is hooked on the video games and powerless to stop him, it was up to [[Faffy]], [[Lula]], and [[Twinkle the Marvel Horse]] (being the only ones without thumbs) to face off against Ned.\n\nNed's second and last appearance was the episode \"I Love Neddy\", Ned Frischman returns to the past attempting to conquer the world using jokes. He becomes the most loved man in the world, and creates a sitcom called \"I Love Neddy\". Dave and the gang create the world's first reality program, \"Real Life Barbarians\", which soon becomes more popular than \"I Love Neddy\". Ned comes to stop Dave and the gang with his jokes. All seems lost, when Dave grabs \"Convenient Feathers\", and tickles Ned back to the future.\n\n==Episode appearances==\n* [[Ned Frischman: Man of Tomorrow]]\n* [[I Love Neddy]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_45633.jpg\nTime Zipper.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_127500.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_171667.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_239700.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_242733.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_246833.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_495467.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_515867.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_611767.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x03 Ned Frischman Man of Tomorrow_621800.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_49133.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_81700.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_84767.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_154700.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_159333.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_187767.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_195867.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_256533.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_267667.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_269933.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_273767.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_485667.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_494867.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_534967.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_598800.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_626000.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x17  I love Neddy_634333.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Dave the Barbarian}}\n[[Category:Dave the Barbarian characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]"
