He got weak when [[Donald Duck]] got a lot of the citizens to fight against the slime. Negaduck then merged with most of the villains to help him try to take over [[Duckburg]] until [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing]], [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]], and the other heroes managed to defeat them.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Since \"Dangerous Currency\" was never approved by [[the Walt Disney Company]], Slime Negaduck is considered non-canon.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
