He was to appear as [[Dr. Terminus]]' showman sidekick and sing the deleted song \"[[The Greatest Star Of All]]\" where he wanted to take [[Elliott]] on a tour, but for the final cut, he was deleted due to the script being too redundant to have two villains.\n\n==Development==\nAccording to the song \"[[The Greatest Star Of All]]\", Ferdinand was originally going to devise a plan to Dr. Terminus by singing to him to have Elliott as a celebrity. However, according to artist [[Ken Anderson]], he advised the team that the film's script should not have more than one villain in the film, causing both Ferdinand and the song to be deleted in the final version. Despite him being deleted, the song can be found in the [[2009]] [[Pete's Dragon (video)|DVD edition of ''Pete's Dragon'']] in the Original Demo Recordings section of the film.<ref>\"The Greatest Star Of All\" song on \"Original Demo Recordings\" section via Bonus Features (DVD; High-Flying Edition of ''Pete's Dragon'', 2009).</ref>\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pete's Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n\n{{Pete's Dragon}}"
