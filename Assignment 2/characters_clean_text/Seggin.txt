Seggin is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Seggin is a Zora and former sergeant who resides in Zora's Domain. He can first be found trying to withstand the electricity of a Shock Arrow, and he is later noted to be quite shock resistant for a Zora. When he notices Link, he's angered by his failure to save Mipha and expresses a desire to attack him. He claims that his training is so he can face Divine Beast Vah Ruta himself and avenge Mipha. If Link takes the arrow from him, he will angrily tell Link to take on the responsibility of appeasing the Divine Beast Vah Ruta. Despite this, he still prepares to attack Vah Ruta on his own on Zora Domain's eastern bridge. However, he gives up when he remembers his fortune that day warned him to be cautious of injury.
Once Divine Beast Vah Ruta has been calmed, Seggin will be remorseful of his previous actions towards Link. He will ask Link to forgive him.
