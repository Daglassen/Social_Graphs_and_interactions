A millionaire and rival business owner of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], Hammer is the CEO of Hammer Industries, intent on developing technology far more advanced than the Iron Man armor or anything Tony builds in order to overtake his place as a captain of industry, however, has resorted to underhanded to outright villainous methods to obtain this goal, such as enlisting or collaborating with supervillains. He is the secondary antagonist of the 2010 film ''Iron Man 2'', enlisting [[Whiplash|Ivan Vanko]]'s help in creating the Hammerdrone line.\n\nJustin Hammer was created by David Michelinie, Bob Layton and John Romita Jr.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''Iron Man 2''====\nHammer is first seen when [[Senator Stern]] called him to declare that the technology created by Tony is a risk to the United States. Hammer tries to discredit Stark showing US enemies trying to create their own armor but eventually is humiliated by Tony who shows a video to the public showing that Hammer also does the same thing.\n\nHammer meets again with Tony in Monaco, he is accompanied by the reporter Christine Everhart. When Tony tells her that Hammer lost the contract with the government she leaves him. Later, he is shown interested in the technology used by [[Whiplash|Vanko]] to attack Tony, then he sends him release from jail for help to discredit Tony. When he learns that Vanko doesn't comply as promised, Hammer gets mad and takes the pet of Vanko.\n\nAfter James Rhodes steals one of Tony's armor, Hammer is called in to improve it. Hammer weaponizes the armor with the best weapons of Hammer Industries. In Stark Expo, his presentation is interrupted by Iron Man, who knows that Hammer is working with Vanko.\nAt that moment, Vanko takes control of the Drones to make these attacks against Tony and the public. Hammer with his technicians tries to take control of Drones but is stopped by Pepper and Natasha Romanoff, who obliged him to give the whereabouts of Vanko. Hammer is arrested after it was discovered that he freed Vanko from jail.\n\n====''[[Marvel One-Shot: All Hail the King|All Hail the King]]''====\nIn All Hail the King, Hammer is sitting beside a fellow prisoner and boyfriend, wondering what is so special about [[Trevor Slattery|Slattery]]. Hammer says Slattery had no army of robots and also has a silly accent. At that time he is seen reading a Forbes Magazine with [[Pepper Potts]] on the cover.\n\n===Marvel Animated Universe===\n====''Avengers Assemble''====\nHe also appeared in ''[[Avengers Assemble]]'' as a wannabe supervillain. He created the robot [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptoid Android]] to take on [[Avengers|the Avengers]]. He also mined Vibranium in the Savage Lands and acquired an army of Raptors to fight the Avengers.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTony-with-justin-hammer.jpg\nhammer-ironman-2.jpg\njustin-hammer-ironman2.jpg\nironman2-hammer.jpg\njustinhammer-ironman2.jpg\nhammer-73.jpg\nhammer-8.jpg\nHammer-23.jpg\nhammer12.jpg\nNormal ironman2 6378.jpg|Justin Hammer's defeat\nHammer-AHTK.png\nJustin_Hammer.png|Hammer in ''Avengers Assemble''\nPepper Cover AHTK.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hammer, Justin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel One-Shot characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Iron Man characters]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]"
