Sefaro is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Sefaro is a curious boy who spends his time with his friend Azu, spying on the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab in an effort to see a mysterious Sheikah girl rumored to be there. Despite his determination, neither he nor Azu have any luck in spotting the little girl. While he would like to go up to the Lab and get a definite answer, Azu reminds him that they are not allowed to get too close. It is getting to the point where Sefaro begins to doubt that the girl exists. If Link gets in the way of his line of sight, Sefaro will angrily demand that he moves. However, if Link shows interest in what he is doing, Sefaro will happily tell him why he and Azu are there before catching himself. Link can attempt to apologize for interrupting Sefaro's mission and the boy will huff at him in irritation.
At 8 in the evening, Sefaro is forced to call it quits for the day and go home. Still, he is adamant about returning in the morning. While he sleeps, he continues to grumble and wonder about the rumored Sheikah girl.
