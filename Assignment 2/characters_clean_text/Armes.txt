Armes is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Armes is a Hylian resident of Lurelin Village, who can be seen carrying a Boat Oar. He is a fisherman by trade, but he remarks that he's unable to go fishing when it rains. This is due to the strength of the wind making it difficult to control boats. During such times, he says all he can do is gamble at Cloyne's shop.
On days with sunny weather, Armes can be found near the Campfire on the beach near the Fish Market. He will tell Link that the fish roasting there look delicious, explaining that he's the one who caught them. If Link speaks to him after examining the fish, Armes will allow Link to take some, since he cooked too many for himself. He'll ask Link if he ate the fish, and if Link says yes, he'll say they're the pride of Lurelin Village.
Armes will also ask Link if he's ever been sailing on a Raft. If Link replies that he hasn't, he'll explain that the wind direction is critical to controlling Raft. He also reveals he's heard of an Item called a Korok Leaf that can help people control the wind. If Link says he has sailed a Raft before, Armes will comment that he never would have guessed based on his appearance. He reminds Link to be careful at sea, as the wind can leave one stranded quickly.
