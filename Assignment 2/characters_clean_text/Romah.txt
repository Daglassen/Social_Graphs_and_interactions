== Biography ==
Romah is a Gerudo who manages Hotel Oasis in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to her, she tells him that he would love what they have to offer. Aside from the usual 20 Rupee cost of a night at an Inn, Romah also offers an 80 Rupee spa plan. She encourages Link to stay at the Inn and rest for a while. Romah says that despite being very popular, she will allow Link to cut to the front of the line for the spa treatment and then asks what she can do for him. If Link asks about the spa plan, Romah is surprised that he has never heard of it and claims that it will fill Link with energy and a feeling of resilience to danger. She also mentions that it will relax Link and leave his skin bright and smooth. During the spa treatment, Romah may comment on how muscular Link is for a Hylian.
