She is a money-hungry gold-digger who plans to marry [[Mitch Evers]] for his money. She is younger than his ex-wife, [[Maggie McKendrick]].\n==Trivia==\n*Joanna Barnes also appeared in the [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|remake of the film]] as Vicky Blake, the mother of its main antagonist, [[Meredith Blake]]. It is possible that she is the same character from the original film. Like Vicky Robinson, she uses the nickname \"Pet\". Apparently after leaving Mitch, she found another rich man named Jesse Blake, who is just as money hungry as her.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, Vicky}}\n{{The Parent Trap}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Parent Trap characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
