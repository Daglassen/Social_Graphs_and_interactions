The teddy was created by the corpse dad, the wolf man and the devil of [[Halloween Town]].\n\nJack Skellington gives him and an undead pull toy duck to a pair of children when he gives presents to the little kids in the real world. The toys both come to life and start chatting the children. Near the end of the movie, [[Santa Claus]] comes and replaces the vampire teddy with a teddy bear that isn't scary like the previous one. He does the same with the other toys that Jack delivered.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]''===\nThe vampire teddy appears in the game as an enemy called \"Trick\".\n\n===[[Disney Crossy Road]]===\nThe vampire teddy is a playable character in this mobile-app based game.\n\n===[[Disney Infinity]]===\nThe vampire teddy appears as an enemy in this sandbox-creation game\n\n===[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]===\n\nIn both versions of Haunted Mansion Holiday, you can see him at the start of the ride. In the California version, he is first seen sitting on top of a stack of presents. He is also in the s\u00e9ance room sitting behind [[Madame Leota]]. Next, he appears in the graveyard blowing a trumpet before guests enter the crypt to see [[Oogie Boogie]]. Finally, he appears above guests as they make the descent into the graveyard, chewing on the lights. In the Tokyo version, he is seen playing a piano to the tune of Haunted Mansion Holiday Nightmare's loading music (\"[[Kidnap the Sandy Claws]]\"). He also appears above the entrance to the crypt just like in the California version, and in one of the portraits in the stretching room.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Vampire Teddy originates from Tim Burton's 1983 Nightmare Before Christmas poem.\n*The Teddy's head-shape is a [[Hidden Mickey]].\n*The teddy bear shares a striking resemblance to the [[Cheshire Cat]] logo of Max Schreck's Department Store in the Tim Burton film Batman Returns which was released a year before the Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nVampire Teddy plush.jpg\nVampire Teddy backpack.jpg\nVampire Teddy with Duck POP.jpg\nVampire Teddy POP Pez.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Nightmare Before Christmas}}\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:The Nightmare Before Christmas characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Vampires]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]"
