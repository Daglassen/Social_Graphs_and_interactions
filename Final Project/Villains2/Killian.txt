He is a powerful technology-based terrorist mastermind with a left bionic arm and is the arch-enemy of [[Lance Sterling]].\n\n==Background==\nHe was attacked by Lance and the spy network in Kyrgyzstan. The attack caused his left hand and half of Killian's face to burn off, forcing him to repair both of them with technology.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nHe has light black hair with blue eyes. He often wears a black plain suit on top of a smooth blue shirt. He has a robot hand for his. When his hologram isn't covering up his burnt off side of the face, a white technology-esque skull with a red-eye.\n\n==Role in the film==\nKillian is first seen arriving at [[Katsu Kimura]]'s hideout, where he and his fellow agents approach him. [[Lance Sterling]] approaches him and Katsu, telling him to give him the briefcase to which after fighting Katsu, he approaches Killian with the briefcase just as he confronts him and threatens to kill him just before Lance flips a table to launch an electric eel at him to save himself. Lance prepares to take the briefcase, but is surrounded by a group of Yakuza agents just as Killian takes the briefcase containing the M9 Assassin inside just as he gets the briefcase to which Lance manages to fight off a group of Yakuza agents and later escapes to retrieve the briefcase from Killian, much to his worry.\n\nLater when Marcy Kappel enters, it is revealed that Killian (disguised as Lance Sterling) stole the M9 Assassin as Lance himself tries to prove that he is wrong just as Lance escapes from H.T.U.V. to deal with Killian. Killian flies on his helicopter to the Covert Weapons Facility at the North Sea to which he uses the M9 Assassin against a soldier guarding the Facility just as Killian enters the hideout.\n\nBack at the Facility, Killian walks past a scientist who explains that the database is almost at full capacity to which he explains to his fellow scientist that he doesn't far about or how many lives the M9 Assassin destroys to which he uses the Assassin against him and drops him into the ocean just as Killian plans to go to Venice. As the dawn arrives at Venice, Killian stops Walter from escaping just as he arrives and confronts him who is after his device as part of his comeuppance to Walter to which while being confronted, Killian prepares to kill Walter who is after the device he is looking for. Lance asks Walter to be careful of Killian to which Walter throws a couple of breadcrumbs for a flock of pigeons to attack him just as the two escape from Killian just as Walter and Lance escape from him.\n\nAs Lance and Walter arrive at the Covert Weapons Facility, Lance sets off to deal with Killian in solo as he captures Lance inside his lair with a thousand drones, explaining to him that he was magnificent, fought in solo, had a lot of catchphrases, and had a couple of explosive gadgets just as Lance explains to him that his job is to protect the world as he explains that Killian has betrayed the agency. Later, Killian sends in a thousand drones to take over the world, much to Lance's worry. Seeing an alert on the computer, it is then known that Walter is arriving back at the Facility to rescue Lance, much to his worry.\n\nLance engages into combat against Killian as part of his plans of taking over the world with a thousand drones terrorizing the world. As Lance goes into a duel against Killian, Walter sends in backup to help Lance consisting of Lovey, Jeff, Crazy Eyes, other pigeons, Marcy, Eyes, Ears, and a couple of Marcy's soldiers to defeat Killian. It is then explained that Walter is planning to get into Killian's system and disable the drones only to find out that the system lost signal to which Walter leaves his hiding place to continue access to Killian's system. Walter then continues going after Killian who is attempting to escape just as he continues progressing to gain access to Killian's claw system to which as Walter successfully gains access, he receives the option of disabling the drones to which Walter deactivates the drones. He places an inflatable hug gadget on Killian which prevents him from falling to his death just as Walter begins to fall back to Earth. All M9 Assassin models sent by Killian are all deactivated thanks to Walter's plan as the H.T.U.V. agency celebrates, followed by Killian's defeat and Lance's bad reputation cleared, causing Lance to be rehired back to being an agent.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nKillian - Profile.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*His original name in the production was going to be \"Tristian McFord\".\n*He has some similarities to Yokai.\n*He has the same last name as Aldrich Killian, the antaganist of \"Iron Man 3\".
