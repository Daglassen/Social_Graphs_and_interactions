He is [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin Skywalker's]] pod racing rival and always cheats in every pod racing event. Although many fellow pod racers are killed or severely injured by Sebulba's reckless steering or cheating, but he's far too popular to be blamed or penalized.\n\n==Background==\n===Biography===\nIn the year of the Invasion of [[Naboo]], Sebulba was the obvious favorite to win the Boonta Eve Classic. He also got into a fight with [[Jar Jar Binks]] in retaliation for Binks accidentally spitting a Gorg he attempted to eat after learning of its expensive cost, into Sebulba's soup. However, the local slave boy Anakin Skywalker, who was also one of his opponents in the Classic, broke up the fight before it began. Sebulba dismissed his anger at Jar Jar to insult Anakin's chances at Pod racing.\n\nOn the day of the race, Sebulba decided to sabotage Anakin's Pod racer by pulling a piece of machinery off one of the engines. He then exchanged insults between himself and his opponent before starting up his own vehicle.\n\nFor a majority of the race, Sebulba maintained the lead while eliminating several other opponents in the process. During the final lap, Anakin's Pod racer had caught up and was now alongside the dangerous Dug. An angry Sebulba resorted to beating up Anakin's vehicle, only for the cables on the Dug's cockpit to get caught on one of Skywalker's engines. When Skywalker broke free, the cables were torn apart, causing Sebulba's Pod racer to get wrecked. To his anger and likely embarrassment his cockpit lands near the finish line and he is not seen again for the rest of the film.\n\nHe would later participate in another Boonta Eve Classic after the Empire was founded, piloting his famous Split-X racer, when a Starspeeder 1000 from the Star Tours Spaceport\u00a0would join the race. After intense weaving and maneuvering, Teemto Pagalies' pod racer became snagged onto the spacecraft, giving it\u00a0double power. Sebulba tried to cheat by throwing a tool at the Starspeeder, but it bounced harmlessly off its viewport. Finally, the pod racer/speeder overtook Sebulba mere feet from the finish line, taking first place, much to his anger and chagrin.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n1000px-Sebulba-SWISE2010.jpg\nSebulba Tsum Tsum Mini.jpg\nPhantom Menace Tsum Tsum T Shirt Grey.jpg\nPhantom Menace Tsum Tsum T Shirt Female.jpg\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-4130.jpg\nStarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-4146.jpg|\"Is this yours?\"\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-4158.jpg|Anakin breaks up the fight before it starts.\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-4177.jpg\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-4249.jpg\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-6129.jpg\nStarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-6135.jpg|\"He always wins.
