Tokk is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==

Tokk is an elderly man who lives in a farmhouse just under the hill where the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab sits. He usually spends his time sitting on a stool out by an Apple Tree in his yard. Tokk is not a forthcoming man, often sighing when spoken to.
Link can ask to speak to Tokk about a few different topics. Should the hero ask about the Great Calamity, Tokk wonders if Uma may have put him up to this. Although he sees no real reason behind Link's curiosity, Tokk relinquishes what he learned about the Calamity from his father. He tells Link about how Hyrule Castle was "contaminated" and how the Great Calamity wiped out nearly everything. Tokk is thankful that Hateno Village managed to survive the disaster due to its far-off location. Tokk also recalls that someone attempted to put an end to the Calamity, but he is quick to dismiss the entire topic as irrelevant.
If Link asks about the place he is in, Tokk at first believes he is inquiring about the farm. However, he is quick to realize that Link likely means the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab above them and tells him that a Sheikah tribe member is conducting research there.
Link can ask who Tokk himself is, but the elder will humbly admit he is naught but an old man.
At 5:00 AM, Tokk wakes up to go to his usual stool outside. He will not discuss anything until he has a seat. Should it rain while he is outside, he will sit inside until it stops. At 9:00 PM, he considers the day to be over and goes to bed.
