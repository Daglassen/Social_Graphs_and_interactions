He is the town's local drunk and a violent, and abusive father who wants to keep Huck forever with him as a punching ball and to spend all the treasure Huck gained at the end of ''Tom Sawyer'' in booze.\n\n== Role in the Film ==\nPap is always hiding from the law. He sometimes leaves Huck and doesn't return for about a year. When he does return, Pap often verbally abuses and beats up Huck \"like a rented mule,\" gets drunk in front of Huck, and on one occasion, tries to kill Huck so he can get the inheritance ($600 based on the movie). His boot contains a nail cross on his heel to ward off the Devil. After Huck was \"murdered,\" Pap set off with some of his acquaintances and climbed in to an old abandoned ship, looking for some riches. Unfortunately, Pap gets shot in the head and died on that very ship.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is possible that Pap murdered Huck's mother, because he doesn't seem to like her being mentioned by Huck.{{Tom Sawyer}}\n[[Category:Tom and Huck characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased]]\n\n[[Category:Males]]"
