He seemed to have a big crush on [[Marnie Piper|Marine]] in the first two movies. He and Marnie seemed to liked each other but it was never revealed if they got together or not, though they probably did not, seeing as how they lived in two different dimensions.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Halloweentown (film)|Halloweentown]]''===\nIn the first movie, he seems to be a handsome jerk, but it is later revealed that he was a goblin working for [[Kalabar]] because he made him handsome. Later, after Kalabar freezes Agatha and Gwen with an evil spell, Luke helps Marnie by risking his life. All ended well, and despite being returned to his goblin form, he got a kiss from Marnie on the cheek.\n\n===''[[Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge]]''===\nIn the second movie he is affected by the Gray Spell, but is later turned back into a goblin. He, Marnie, and Aggie run to Gort's to find it clean. He and Marnie then use a time travel spell to try and find [[Agatha Cromwell's Spellbooks]], but to no avail. Later he helps Marnie figure out how to reverse the Gray Spell. In the end he makes a portal spell with Agatha, Marnie, [[Sophie Piper|Sophie]], and [[Dylan Piper|Dylan]].\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nHalloweentowndf-08.jpg|Luke under the Grey Spell in ''Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge''.\nLuke turns to a grayish color .jpg\nLUKE.jpg\nTumblr ltbxyzza4x1qdpdxuo9 250.jpg|Luke as a goblin (normal) in ''Halloweentown II''.\nLuke_the_goblin.png\n</gallery>\n{{Halloweentown}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Halloweentown characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Goblins]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
