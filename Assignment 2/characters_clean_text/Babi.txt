Babi is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Babi is a Gerudo soldier who wields a Gerudo Spear, and she can be found in the barracks in Gerudo Town. She trains some of the other soldiers. If Link speaks to her, she warns him that they are on high alert and that outsiders must stay out of their way. If Link speaks to Babi while Malena is asking her for help, Babi exclaims that Link and Malena still wander into the barracks, despite her warnings. She warns Link that they would be in pieces if they were not busy.
After Link receives permission from Captain Teake, Babi says that they are busy spear training and that Link cannot interfere, even with Teake's permission.
If Link speaks to Babi after recovering the Thunder Helm, she proclaims that she must prevent a crime like that from happening again. She believes that her diligence will inspire others.
Marta remarks that once their spears are repaired, she believes Babi will have more special training from them. She also claims that Babi is working too hard, even though the heirloom has been returned, hopinh to never be as intense as she is. Smaude also comments, wondering if Babi thinks training without rest proves her discipline and wishing Babi could feel how tired she is. She also thinks Babi would train for days on end if no one stopped her. In addition, she tries to avoid eye contact with her so she doesn't get dragged into her training.
