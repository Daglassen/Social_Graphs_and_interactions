Nightmare first uses his powers to put all of [[New York]] into a deep sleep, making the population of [[New York]] vulnerable to his attacks. [[Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Iron Fist]], [[Nova]] and [[White Tiger]] go to the Dream Dimension (the place where dreams take place, the place everyone goes when they dream after falling asleep) with the help of [[Doctor Strange]] to confront Nightmare. Nightmare uses his powers to create nightmares for the heroes, but Spider-Man's heroic willpower allows everyone to leave the Dream Dimension with a captured Nightmare. Since Nightmare has no powers in the waking world, Doctor Strange casts a spell that imprisons Nightmare in a chest.\n\nLater, Nightmare escapes from the chest and gives Spider-Man a dream that shows a world without Spider-Man, the point being to demoralize him by convincing him that the world is better off without him. However, Spider-Man remains true to his convictions, wakes up, and defeats Nightmare in the waking world.\n\nLater, Nightmare is given his final defeat by [[Hulk]], Doctor Strange,\u00a0[[Vampire By Night]]\u00a0and [[Warwolf]].\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
