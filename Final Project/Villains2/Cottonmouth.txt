His uncle forced him onto the streets as his cousin Mariah Dillard went to boarding school. He was turned savage after his Mama Mabel forced him to shoot Uncle Pete for making deals with their rivals. Together with the famous gangster known as 'Pop', they became some of the most ruthless criminals to run the streets of Harlem.\n\nStokes later opened the nightclub Harlem's Paradise, which was however only a front for his illegal criminal activities.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nLuke Cage - Promotional Image - Cottonmouth.jpg\nCottonmouth the King.jpg|Cottonmouth before he beats Shameek Smith\nShades, Cottonmouth and Luke Cage.jpg|Cottonmouth confronted by [[Luke Cage]] as [[Shades]] looks on\nCottonmouth RPG.png|Cottonmouth attempts to kill Luke Cage\nCottonmouth2.jpg|Young Cottonmouth\nCottonmouth3.jpg|Young Cottonmouth kills Pistol Pete\nCottonmouth2.png|Cottonmouth shoots Koko in the head\nMisty Knight and Cottonmouth.jpg|[[Misty Knight]] confronts Cottonmouth\nCottonmouth and Luke Cage.png|Cottonmouth and Luke Cage confront each other\nCottonmouth and Rafael Scarfe.jpg|Cottonmouth meets with Detective Scarfe\nCottonmouth4.jpg|Cottonmouth before he is murdered by his cousin [[Black Mariah|Mariah Dillard]]\nMarvel Disk Wars The Avengers - Cottonmouth (Burchell Clemens).png\n</gallery>\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:marvelcinematicuniversewikia.com:Cottonmouth|Cottonmouth in Marvel Cinematic Universe Wiki]]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Luke Cage characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]"
