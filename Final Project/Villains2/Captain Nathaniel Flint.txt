He was a space pirate renowned by those who knew him as one of the most notorious and feared criminals in galactic history.\n==Background==\nCaptain Nathaniel Flint belonged to an unnamed alien species with fangs, multiple eyes and a reptilian-like face. At some point in his life, he became a pirate, and his infamy was so staggering that he was known as the most feared of all pirates. At some point, he apparently stole [[Treasure Planet (location)|Treasure Planet]] from a highly-developed species of unknown identity. After many years of looting merchant ships, Flint buried a vast treasure in the center chamber of treasure planet (which is in fact a giant alien mechanism). Even before and after his death, Flint\u2019s greed made him desire to keep the treasure to himself and nobody else. He entrusted the [[Map of Treasure Planet|map to Treasure Planet]] to his first mate [[Billy Bones (Treasure Planet)|Billy Bones]] and stole the memory chip of his robot navigator, [[B.E.N.]]. Flint also rigged the planet to explode if someone should find his treasure. Shortly after setting up this deadly booby trap, Flint stayed inside the center of Treasure Planet with his treasure and soon died guarding it.\n\nWhen the [[R.L.S. Legacy]] crew discover the treasure in the present day, [[Jim Hawkins (Treasure Planet)|Jim]] and B.E.N. encounter Flint's long dead skeleton, and Jim tears off one skeletal hand to find and insert B.E.N's memory chip, and they proceed to set off the booby trap. The trap succeeds in destroying the planet, taking the treasure and what was left of Flint\u2019s remains with it, thus fulfilling Flint\u2019s greedy desires to keep his treasure to himself. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the original ''Treasure Island ''novel, Captain Flint's name is Captain J. Flint (the J stands for James). In contrast to the one in the movie, the novel version of Flint actually wanted someone to find his treasure, having used a corpse to point the way to it. In the movie, the skeleton the crew finds is Flint's own, although this Flint was so bent on keeping his treasure to himself he didn\u2019t want anyone to take it even after his death.\n* He is the posthumous overarching antagonist of the movie. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nCaptain Flint 5.jpg\nCaptain Flint 4.jpg\ntreasure-planet-disneyscreencaps.com-68.jpg|\"Fire!\"\nCaptain Flint Treasure Planet.jpg\nCaptain Flint 1.jpg|Flint's remains\nCaptain Flint 2.jpg|Jim finally meets Captain Flint\nCaptain Flint 3.jpg|Flint's skull\ntreasure-planet-disneyscreencaps.com-8876.jpg|B.E.N.'s memory circuit in the bony clutches of Flint\n</gallery>\n\n{{Treasure Planet}}\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Treasure Planet characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
