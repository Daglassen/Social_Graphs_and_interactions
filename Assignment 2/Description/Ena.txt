Throughout the day, Ena follows {{Term|BotW|Banji|link}} around and assists her with chores. In the morning, they tend to the Stable's {{Plural|BotW|White Goat|link}}, where she encourages one of the Goats, Mr. Goat, to eat.<ref>{{Cite|Mr. Goat, Mr. Goat! Eat that grass, eat that grass!

Helping out!|Ena|BotW}}</ref> She wants to know if {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} keeps his cargo in his pouch.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, mister. Do you put your cargo in your pouch?|Ena|BotW}}</ref> She then informs Link of a rumor that the {{Term|BotW|Korok|link|display=forest people}} can expand one's {{Term|BotW|Inventory|link}} and asks if he's heard of this.<ref>{{Cite|Didja hear the rumor about how the forest people can give you a bigger inventory?

Yaaaay! Now we're friends! Now we're friends! I hear you can collect things the forest children drop! What do you think their droppings look like?|Ena|BotW}}</ref> On the contrary, if Link hasn't heard the rumor, Ena claims to have heard it from a {{Term|BotW|Fairy|link}} that told her to be nice to a {{Term|BotW|Hestu|link|display=big forest child}} to receive a bigger Inventory.<ref>{{Cite|You haven't heard?! I heard about it from a fairy! He said, \"If you're nice to a really big forest kid, he'll make your inventory bigger!\"|Ena|BotW}}</ref> Despite not knowing what an Inventory is, Ena believes that bigger is always better.<ref>{{Cite|I don't know what an inventory is, but bigger is always better if you ask me!|Ena|BotW}}</ref> She wonders if the big forest kid ever leaves the {{Term|BotW|Korok Forest|link|display=forest}}.<ref>{{Cite|I wonder if the big forest kid ever leaves the forest...|Ena|BotW}}</ref>\n\nEna sings songs as she takes care of the Stable's {{Plural|BotW|Horse|link}}, one about Horses and one about poop.<ref>{{Cite|\u266aHorsey!

And that if you go through that tunnel, you can get INSIDE the castle!|Ena|BotW}}</ref> However, the man warned her against going due to the danger of Hyrule Castle, which she relays to Link as well.<ref>{{Cite|But the man also said not to go near the castle because it's dangerous. That goes for you too, mister!|Ena|BotW}}</ref> Despite the speed of his Horse, she tells him to avoid the Castle.<ref>{{Cite|I heard there's a small tunnel west of the castle entrance. But no matter how fast your horse is, you shouldn't go there because it's too dangerous!|Ena|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring the rain, Ena flees inside the {{Term|BotW|Stable|link}}, where she sits at the end of one of the beds with {{Term|BotW|Kenyo|link}}. She considers bringing Mr. Goat inside.<ref>{{Cite|Rain, rain, drippity drip...
