He was\u00a0[[Sylvia]]'s old partner before she met\u00a0[[Wander]].\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nRyder is a rough and tough guy and uses words like \"grop\". He also likes to fight, just like Sylvia. But sometimes he can get quite mad, like when Wander was messing up his mission.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nRyder is of a humanoid species, standing almost tall as Sylvia. He has blue hair in a similar style to Sylvia but longer, yellowish skin and a black visor with a red dot. He wears a long-sleeved shirt with black pants, boots and gloves, and a black jacket with a red, green and blue line on it.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Main===\n===='''Sylvia'''====\nHe was partners with Sylvia before she met Wander. When they met again, they fought for a brief moment but for fun, and were mostly friendly with each other.\n\n===='''Wander'''====\nThrough the episode, Ryder has shown slight animosity and disbelief that Sylvia had him as a partner, and was generally dismissive of him.\n\n==='''Lord Hater'''===\nRyder seemed to know Lord Hater sometime before the events of \"The Rider\" as he stole something that belonged to Lord Hater. Throughout the episode, the goal was to break in to Hater's ship and give back all the stolen goods. His real goal was to actually keep it to himself.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although Craig McCracken confirmed his name is spelled\u00a0'''Ryder''', most summaries of The Rider spell it as\u00a0'''Rider'''.\n*He is based on Han Solo from the Star Wars series.\n*He is the second known character to be a common enemy between both Wander\u00a0''and''\u00a0Lord Hater, after\u00a0Sourdough.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ryder}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
