The Gerudo keep their skin so beautiful thanks to the mushrooms that grow here.|Ardin|BotW}}</ref> Depending on the time of day, she will also remark that {{Term|BotW|Link}} has a lot of energy being awake this early, if spoken to in the morning,<ref>{{Cite|Sav'otta! You've got a lot of energy. More of a morning person, huh?|Ardin|BotW}}</ref> or comment on the temperature if spoken to around noon or in the evening.<ref>{{Cite|Sav'aaq! It's another hot one today, huh?|Ardin|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Sav'saaba! Now that it's the evening, it's gotten much cooler, hasn't it?|Ardin|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAs a merchant {{Term|BotW|Ardin}} is very keen to sell her wares, with her tactics ranging from persuasion<ref>{{Cite|It would really be a waste if you left Gerudo Town without taking some of these mushrooms with you!|Ardin|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|If you've got some money, take a look at my mushrooms.|Ardin|BotW}}</ref> to telling tall and implausible lies<ref>{{Cite|Oh, well, if someone as pretty as you can't see them, that means... Then Ardin must have made up another silly lie. She tells really weird ones sometimes.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref> in order to make some money. If {{Term|BotW|Link}} purchases all of the {{Plural|BotW|Mushroom}} from her stall she will pretend her stall is full of rare and mysterious {{Plural|BotW|Mushroom}}, that are only visible to the most beautiful.<ref>{{Cite|Vasaaq! Step right up and sample my wares: rare, mysterious mushrooms, only visible to the eyes of the most beautiful!|Ardin|BotW}}</ref> If {{Term|BotW|Link}} talks to her about this, she will admit that after he bought all her {{Plural|BotW|Mushroom}} she had nothing left to restock her stall with, but she think people will fall for this.<ref>{{Cite|Oh-it's just you.\nAfter you bought all my mushrooms, I had nothing left to restock my stall... But now, I think people will fall for this.|Ardin|BotW}}</ref> She does in fact manage to convince both {{Term|BotW|Jules|link}}<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|Mushrooms that only beautiful people can see... I think...maybe I\u2019m starting to see something?}}|Jules|BotW}}</ref> and {{Term|BotW|Nellie|link}}, although the latter requires {{Term|BotW|Link}}\u2019s help.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, wow, really? And I thought it was all some kind of joke that Ardin came up with to trick her customers when she's all out... Well, I don't care if I can see them or not. I could have seen them when I was younger\u2014that much I know.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDespite her trickery, {{Term|BotW|Ardin}} is genuinely interested in {{Plural|BotW|Mushroom}} and will tell {{Term|BotW|Link}} facts about them, such as that they enjoy the cool weather.<ref>{{Cite|You know, mushrooms enjoy the cool weather. You might find some around... Take the time to look.|Ardin|BotW}}</ref> She encourages {{Term|BotW|Link}} to take an interest in them despite not being an expert herself, quietly admitting that although there is lots of interesting information about mushrooms she does not understand a lot of it.<ref>{{Cite|Just between us...
