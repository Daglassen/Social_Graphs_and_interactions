He is a powerful [[mutants|mutant]] and supervillain, and is the archenemy to the [[X-Men (team)|X-Men]], who appears in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''.\n\nMagneto was created by\u00a0[[Stan Lee]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Film Appearances==\n===''[[Dark Phoenix]]''===\nMagneto appears in the film, ''Dark Phoenix'', played by [[Michael Fassbender]]. Magneto resides on the mutant haven Genosha by the time of the movie's story. Jean Grey comes to his residence for advice, asking how was he able to put aside his desire to kill others, leading Magneto to suspect her that she has killed someone, pointing out a bloodstain on her shirt and he confronts her about it. Their confrontation is interrupted by the arrival of the military force, demanding to arrest Jean after she has caused chaos during the incident in Red Hook. Jean then nearly destroys the whole military operation after ripping out one helicopter, and Magneto struggles to send the men away. He then lashes out at Jean, banishing her from Genosha. Hank McCoy arrives at Genosha, revealing that Jean is the one who caused the death of Raven, and Magneto, along with mutants Ariki and Selene, joins Hank to hunt and kill Jean. The group is confronted by the X-Men, consisting of Xavier, Storm, Scott, and Kurt. Magneto then encounters Jean, along with the D'Bari leader Vuk who controls her, now seemingly the Dark Phoenix, and after an unsuccessful attempt to execute her, she throws him away from the building, and all the mutants are sedated and arrested by the military operation, and they are taken to a facility, aboard a train. Xavier then reveals his guilt towards his action of blocking Jean's memory and asks for Magneto and Hank's mercy. The train is attacked by the D'Bari army and the groups unite to take them down. Magneto is later seen fighting the D'Bari forces before getting knocked off by Vuk. Jean then awakes and creating shields to protect her allies before lifting the train and crashing it to the ground. Magneto and the rest of the X-Men witness Jean's confrontation with the D'Bari and Vuk, killing them and flies to the outer space, seemingly gone. After that event, Xavier's school is renamed after Jean, and Xavier retires as the headmaster with Hank to replace him. Magneto then encounters Xavier in Paris, inviting him for a chess game, offers him his alliance after stating the sincerity Xavier has given him throughout the years, and they reconcile.\n\n==Television Appearances==\n===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===\n[[File:Magneto-1-.png|thumb|left|Magneto photo seen in ''Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes''.]]Magneto arrives at Avengers Mansion with his two children, the [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Quicksilver]], in search of the [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]], having heard in the news that she is a mutant, and wanted her to join the Brotherhood of Mutants.\u00a0The [[Avengers]] face him, just as Magneto was attacking anti-mutant demonstrators, who were outside the mansion, but thanks to his magnetic powers, Magneto easily defeat to [[Iron Man]] and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], whose [[Iron Man (armor)|armor]] and [[Mjolnir|hammer]] are made \u200b\u200bof metal, while Pietro and Wanda faced [[Captain America]] and the Wasp.\u00a0Then Magneto imprisoned the rest of the Avengers, explaining the reasons for his arrival, but the Wasp tells that she is not a mutant and that the Avengers don't keep her prisoner.\u00a0When one of the protesters threw a brick to Magneto, he unleashed havoc against the crowd, causing Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to turn against their father because of his attitude. For their betrayal, Magneto attacks them both, who with the help of the Wasp is released, making Magneto decide to attack her. But then, the Avengers are released from their bonds and attack Magneto, who escapes from the battle, proclaiming that the war between mutants and humans will come and that his children will fight on his side soon, or will be destroyed. Magneto was seen in a photo, on [[Nick Fury]]'s wall of [[Skrull]] suspects in the episode \"Infiltration\".\n\n===''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''===\nCharles Xavier convinces Magneto to help the Avengers and [[X-Men (team)|X-Men]] against [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] as there's a young Mutant whose life is in danger too. Magneto arrives and defeats the Loki-controlled [[Sentinel]]s while [[Captain America]] and the [[X-Men (team)|X-Men go]] to rescue the other [[Avengers]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the X-Men comics and TV shows, he was the best friend of his fellow mutant Charles Xavier, aka [[Professor X]]. Both visionaries for mutantkind, they later became unfortunate rivals as their visions greatly differed. Xavier believed in coexistence between mutants and humanity, whereas Magneto believes in mutant supremacy, wishing to subjugate humans, under the belief that humanity will soon do the same to mutants. This is the driving force between their rivalry.\n*In the comics, Magneto was the father of [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver]], with both having allied with him off-and-on in his quest for mutant supremacy. However, with their introduction into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and Fox having possessed the film rights to the character, Magneto's position as Wanda and Pietro's father was removed for the MCU. However, the ''X-Men'' introduce their own version of Quicksilver starting in the 2014 film ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'', where their familial relationship is intact.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"medium\" widths=\"150\">\nDark_Phoenix_Magneto.jpeg\nMagneto-DWA.png\nMagneto MDW Chart.jpg\n1fdc.png\nLego Magneto.png\nDark Phoenix Poster.jpg\nDark Phoenix - Poster.jpg\nDark Phoenix - Japanese Poster.jpg\nDark Phoenix - Magneto.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:X-Men Cinematic Universe]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]"
