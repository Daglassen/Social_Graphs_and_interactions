Cima is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Cima is a Hylian worker at Lakeside Stable in West Necluda. She tends to the Horses that reside at the Stable during the day. At night, she sleeps in one of the Stable's beds.
When Link first speaks to Cima, she complains about how nervous Lightning makes her when it strikes the Stable. She asks Link to figure out when the Stable is struck so often. Cima will be happy if he accepts, which initiates the "Thunder Magnet" Side Quest.
On top of the Stable, Link can find a Woodcutter's Axe. After taking the Axe, Link can return to Cima to inform her. She realizes that the Axe must have been drawing the Lightning to the Stable and wonders if it was put up there on purpose. She thanks Link for his help, giving him a Rubber Helm. Cima is relieved to finally be able to relax. This completes the Side Quest.
Cima will ask Link if he's seen the Waterfalls leading into Lake Floria. She claims each one is unique and worth seeing. While she's going to sleep, she tells Link to wait for whatever he needs until tomorrow.
