Thaddeus sends them to the boat stop and wait for Roosevelt to show up. When Roosevelt arrives and meets [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]], [[Jane Porter|Jane]], and [[Archimedes Q. Porter|Professor Archimedes]], Jake and Sam want to be his guide, but he chooses Tarzan to guide him to the jungle since he finds him more interesting, much to the two men's disbelief.\n\nJake and Sam later capture Roosevelt and get away with him on a boat. Tarzan sees this and tries to free the president, but he gets captured by the two men as well. Tarzan and Roosevelt are in a cage in a temple, where they meet Thaddeus. Later, when Jake enters their cage, Tarzan pushes him to the ground and escapes with Roosevelt, whose left leg is now injured. The two men run into the bad guys when they get to the outside of the temple, fight them off, and defeat them.\n\nWhile Tarzan makes Roosevelt rest on a rock next to a river and meet Tarzan's vervet monkey friends, Thaddeus and his minions are looking for them. Jake and Sam tell him that they couldn't find them and Thaddeus makes them shoot their smoke guns to capture their attention. Tarzan and Roosevelt hear the gun shots, see the smoke, and hide under a tree branch. Tarzan suggests that he has one of his monkey friends guide them to a safer place.\n\nThe monkey takes the two men to a waterfall that leads them to another part of the jungle. When the monkey leaves, Tarzan and Roosevelt see an aircraft with Thaddeus and his minions coming out of it. When Tarzan is about to attack Thaddeus, Jake traps him in a net. The jungle animals show up and are about to attack the bad guys, but they escape before they do so. However, Terk frees Tarzan from the net and Tarzan prevents Jake and Sam from completely going back into the aircraft.\n\nJake and Sam are later seen getting surrounded by [[Tantor]] and the other elephants, who are about to attack them along with Thaddeus and his other men who managed to escape the aircraft explosion. The bad guys then get arrested.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h01m52s265.png|Jake\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h01m57s040.png|Sam\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h06m19s844.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h08m34s068.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h08m49s476.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h09m03s492.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h11m29s349.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h12m08s217.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h12m27s958.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h13m22s666.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h14m17s763.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h16m35s804.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h17m27s163.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h17m44s634.png\nvlcsnap-2015-05-29-13h20m00s115.png|Jake & Sam's defeats (and Thaddeus')\n</gallery>\n{{Tarzan}}\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
