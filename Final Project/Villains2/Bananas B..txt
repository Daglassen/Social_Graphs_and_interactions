At first, he was much better at the job than Fu Dog, but when [[Councilor Chang|Chang]] escaped and went after Jake, he switched sides out of fear for his life. He would have helped Chang kill Jake if Fu Dog had not arrived to help. Ever since then, he was Chang's assistant, helping her in whatever evil scheme she was doing, including the revival of [[the Dark Dragon]].\n\nHowever, during the showdown between the Dragon Council and the Dark Dragon, he once again showed his cowardly side, abandoning Chang and The Dark Dragon, saying he \"hates violence\". While attempting to flee the temple, he was confronted by a gleeful Fu Dog who proceeded to chase him.<ref name=\"hkl\">[[The Hong Kong Longs]]</ref>\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season Two===\n*\"[[Nobody's Fu]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[Being Human]]\"\n*\"[[The Hong Kong Longs]]\" (final appearance)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBananas B..jpg\nBananas B Full.jpg\nBananas B with Jake.jpg\nBeing Human (21).jpg\nBeing Human (28).jpg\nBeing Human (29).jpg\nBeing Human (31).jpg\nBeing Human (33).jpg\nNobody's Fu (17).jpg\nBananas B. and Fu Dog.jpg\nRotwood and Bananas B. know each other back in the day.jpg\nNobody's Fu (26).jpg\nDanica gives Jake her phone number.jpg\nChang and her Troll Soldiers had Jake Spud and Bananas B. captive.jpg\nBananas B. betrayed Jake to join himself with Chang.jpg\nChang and Bananas B.
