Not to be confused with Astor, a character from Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity
Aster  is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
This little girl resides in Hateno Village with her father, Medda. She is usually found running about in front of The Great Ton Pu Inn, laughing to herself. Aster is a big fan of the Bolson Dance and will ask Link if he knows it. Link can either recognize it and please the child, or admit that he does not know it and allow her to teach it to him.
If Link speaks to her again later, he can ask about either Bolson himself or the dance. Aster will tell the hero that Bolson is a carpenter and how he can find him behind the East Wind. Apparently, Bolson is also a luminary in his field, but Aster does not fully understand that title and instead tells Link to get Bolson to show him his dance. She also says she heard he was a construction company, but she's not sure how that's possible. In addition, Aster may share she heard that Bolson is a famous president or designer. Whatever she says, Aster will direct Link to Bolson so he can see the dance for himself.
Asking her about the dance will get her to show it to Link. Telling her to stop will upset Aster, and she will call him lame.
At 8 o'clock, Aster goes home to go to bed. She'll also remark that if she doesn't get home soon, she will get in trouble. As she sleeps, she dreams about her absent mother.


== Trivia ==
When it rains, Aster will run to the nearby outdoor kitchen and pretend to cook. She plays with a mound of material as though kneading it like dough.
Should Link approach her with a Torch lit with Blue Flame, she will excitedly follow him around.
