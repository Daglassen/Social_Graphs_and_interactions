She is an advanced android built by [[Dr. Drakken]], formerly designed to get close to Kim Possible in order to steal her \"spark\", until she turned when Kim saved her from being destroyed after Drakken no longer had any use for her.\n\n\n\n==Role in the film==\n''\"A\u00a0new high school student\u00a0Kim\u00a0and Ron befriend who ironically also happens to be the ultimate\u00a0Kim\u00a0Possible\u00a0fan. Her dream comes true when she finds herself tagging along on important missions and joining in on all of the action and adventure.\"''\n\n==Trivia==\n*The outfit Athena wears resembles Kim Possible's Season 4 outfit from the TV series.\n*She is just like [[Bebe]] the Android that Dr. Drakken made to be perfect in the animated series.\n**She is also similar to [[Eric (Kim Possible)|Eric]] from ''[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama|So the Drama]]''. Both are androids created by Dr. Drakken with a human appearance with the sole purpose of infiltrating Kim's life. Unlike Eric, who has no redeeming change of character or remorse for his actions, Athena ends up turning a leaf and becoming a genuine friend and teammate to Kim.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nCiara Wilson as Athena.jpg\nKim Possible movie poster.jpg\nKim Possible - Ron, Kim & Athena.jpg\nKim Possible - Photograpgy - Ron, Athena and Kim.jpg\nKP - Apple tree.jpg\nKim Possible (film) (131).png\nKim Possible (film) (134).png\nKim Possible (film) (88).png\nKim Possible (film) (145).png\nKim Possible (film) (126).png\nKim Possible (film) (130).png\nKim Possible (film) (89).png\nKim Possible (film) (151).png\nKim Possible (film) (93).png\nKim Possible (film) (94).png\nKim Possible (film) (71).png\nKim Possible (film) (166).png\nKim Possible (film) (147).png\nKim Possible (film) (114).png\nKP 2019 - Athena's Inner Workings.png|Athena reveals her inner workings\nKim Possible (film) (40).png\nKim Possible (film) (97).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel Original Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
