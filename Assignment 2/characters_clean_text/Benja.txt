Benja is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Benja is a Hylian man who is the leader of a group of merchants, one of them being Robsten. Link finds Benja in the Gerudo Desert sands outside of Gerudo Town, watching the entrance closely.
When Link speaks to him, Benja asks if Link has business with him. Link asks if he is spying and Benja immediately rejects the idea, saying that he is a merchant and the leader of a caravan. Benja explains that he traveled all the way to Gerudo Town, but they do not allow men inside. Again, Link asks him if he is spying, and Benja defensively exclaims that it is just research and explains that he found out key information on how to sneak into Gerudo Town.
Link can ask about the information, causing Benja to share his "heroic tale" with him. He says that he has been there for more than a week and that the guards have kicked him out of Gerudo Town more times than he can count. He explains that he has heard about a man who frequently travels between the Kara Kara Bazaar and Gerudo Town. Therefore, Benja has been waiting to spot this man to ask him how he is able to sneak into the town. After he finishes speaking, Link receives the "Forbidden City Entry" Main Quest.
If Link speaks to Benja while wearing the Gerudo Set, Benja will scream and mutter that this "young lady" is just his type. Link again asks Benja if he is spying, causing Benja to nervously stutter that he is only investigating. Benja mutters to himself that this conversation seems very familiar.
After Link calms the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, Benja can be found at the Kara Kara Bazaar with Robsten and says that he never found the man who was able to sneak into Gerudo Town, commenting about how hard it is to wait around in the unpleasant desert.
