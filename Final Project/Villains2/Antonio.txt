He tried to make sure he got the part by researching Mr. Blaine's failed musical\u00a0''Floss''\u00a0and using it as his audition piece, it worked as he got the part. He was very arrogant in thinking the show revolved around him, he brought in some talent scouts to watch his performance. In the end, the curtain fell onto him (thanks to Zack and Cody) and he left the stage. Later, he came back and almost ruined it for Maddie, and in the end, he, along with Mr. Blaine, Maddie, London, Cody and Zack, danced to the song '''Floss'''.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Suite Life}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Suite Life characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
