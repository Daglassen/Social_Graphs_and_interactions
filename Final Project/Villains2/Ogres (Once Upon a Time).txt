[[Maurice|Sir Maurice]] desperately reached out to [[Rumplestiltskin]] to protect his people. He agrees to protect them from the Ogres, but only if [[Belle]] becomes his eternal servant. Though Sir Maurice vehemently declines, Belle agrees to the deal so her loved ones will be safe.\n\nWhen [[Emma Swan|Emma]] and [[Snow White|Snow]] are transported back to the Enchanted Forest through a portal, they travel with [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] and [[Aurora]] in search of a magic wadrobe to take them home. While gathering wood, Snow is attacked by Aurora, who blames her for [[Prince Phillip]]'s \"death.\" Upon Mulan's intervention, Emma arrives, and believing Mary Margaret is being threatened, she fires a gunshot into the air. Roused due to the noise, an ogre manifests and chases after them. As the beast rushes towards a fallen Emma, Mary Margaret kills the ogre with an arrow to the eye.\n\nOnce [[The Evil Queen|Regina]] undoes the first curse resulting in everyone returning to the Enchanted Forest, they join Aurora and Prince Phillip, who report the Ogres have since been defeated.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=150 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center bordercolor=transparent>\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x03 - Lady of the Lake - Ogre and Emma.png\nOnce Upon a Time - 6x13 - Ill-Boding Patterns - Ogre.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 6x13 - Ill-Boding Patterns - Ogre 2.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 5x17 - Her Handsome Hero - Ogre in Hole.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 5x17 - Her Handsome Hero - Young Ogre.jpg|Child Ogre\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x03 - Lady of the Lake - Ogre and Emma.png\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x03 - Lady of the Lake - Ogre Screaming.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x03 - Lady of the Lake - Mary Margaret Vs.
