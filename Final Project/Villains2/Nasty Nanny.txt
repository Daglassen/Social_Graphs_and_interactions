She is, as her name implies, a mean lady who does not treat Rachel properly.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nNasty Nanny is shown to be rude, spiteful, and grouchy, not getting along with Rachel very well. She pressures Rachel to try out many classes to which she doesn't show any interest in trying new things.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nNanny wears a blue shirt with black skirt alongside black leggings and black slippers.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Fantasia 2000]]''===\nNasty Nanny is first seen with [[Rachel]] leaving alongside various people from an apartment building as Rachel's parents bid a farewell to her as they go to work. She takes Rachel to various classes such as dancing, music, swimming, art, gymnastics, and piano class to which Rachel does not seem satisfied much to her harshness.\n\nLater while preparing her to get ready for another class, Rachel struggles and accidentally causes her ball to fall, followed by Rachel and Nanny chasing the ball falling off from the window just as Rachel's parents notice her in a large traffic in panic, alongside her nanny. Afterwards, Nanny faints in frustration while Rachel's parents save their daughter; Rachel's dream of being reunited with her parents finally comes true.\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
