He is eventually swallowed by a [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]] on his last try, but he escapes from the crocodile's stomach and runs away, scared out of his wits, never to be seen again.\n\n==Appearances==\nRaja first appeared as an unnamed Royal Bengal tiger in the short ''[[Tiger Trouble]]'', where he tried to eat the tiger hunter [[Goofy]] in the jungles of [[India]].\n\nHis most famous appearance was in the [[1960]] short film ''[[Goliath II]]'' in which he attempts to eat the [[Goliath II|small titular elephant]] many times before he is eventually thrown to the [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]] by [[Goliath II's mother]].\n\nHe has also appeared in the TV show ''[[TaleSpin]]'' in the episode \"[[Save the Tiger]]\" as an unnamed assistant of [[Shere Khan#TaleSpin|Shere Khan]], working for [[Khan Industries]]. He also made a cameo in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Year of the Dog]]\", where [[Mickey Mouse]] accidentally splashes him with a torrent of soda from a billboard.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Raja was a character that inspired people to create another character; in this case, a [[Wolf (The Sword in the Stone)|wolf]] based on him in ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''.\n*[[Louie the Mountain Lion]] seems to be modeled after Raja from ''[[Tiger Trouble]]''.\n*Raja is made to look like the short's main antagonist but is never seen again after halfway into the short. The short's real villain is the [[Mouse (Goliath II)|mouse]].\n*When Raja tries to trap Goliath II with his tail after he accidentally wakes him up by hitting him on the head with a cattail, the stripes on his tail shift so that the tip of his tail is now colored orange when normally it's supposed to be black.\n* When Raja gets twisted around by [[Goliath II's mother]]'s trunk, Raja is heard screeching like a cat. In reality, tiger cries sound nothing like housecat calls - this would be intended for comedic effect. This kind of \"tiger with cat sounds\" scenario would be repeated when [[Rajah]] gets turned into a cub by [[Jafar]] in Aladdin.\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n[[Category:Tigers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Goliath II characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
