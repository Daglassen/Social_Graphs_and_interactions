She carries a pack of gerbil-like gremlins along with her, which Al often tries to eat.\n\nWhen she presses the buttons on her tuning fork, it activates the shock mechanism on the the gremlins' collars, which causes the gremlins to go crazy and dismantle things. After sabotaging planes, she charges outrageous fees to have them fixed.\n\n==Role in the episode==\nCrazy Edie had just sabotaged another customer's plane, when a mob of angry pilots arrived on the scene. Edie took off before the mob could reach her, celebrating her scheme. The next morning, Crazy Edie arrived at [[Cape Suzette]]. When Al was getting Edie her morning coffee, his appetite worked up at sight of the gremlins. Crazy Edie snapped at her pet to hurry up with her morning coffee (she got cranky without it), and the bumbling alligator opened the cargo hold by mistake. Al noticed the cage containing the gremlins moving toward the open hatch, which made him toss the coffee cup in the air. The hot coffee spilt all over Edie, who momentarily lost control of the plane. The cage's support wires snapped, and the cage fell out the back, which caused an angry Edie to scold Al for his mishaps. The Gremlins were found by [[Wildcat]], who brought them to his [[Wildcat's Houseboat|houseboat]]. Of course, they couldn't hide from Crazy Edie for very long, and she eventually tracked them and recaptured them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nSoundandFurry - 038.jpg\nSoundandFurry - 071.jpg\nEdie bops Al.jpg\nCrazy Edie finds gremlins.jpg\nWildcat startles Edie.jpg\nCrazyEdie045.jpg\nSoundandFurry - 1933.jpg\nEdie caught.jpg\ngreasenspoon.png|Crazy Edie's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Seagulls]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
