She appeared in episode 62, \"[[Maid of the Myth]]\".\n==''[[DuckTales]]''==\n===\"[[Maid of the Myth]]\"===\nShe was angry when [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] arrived in her land but her husband gave her a gold necklace and lots of other stuff. The queen was jealous that her people were interested in Mrs. Beakley's singing voice but she had a plan for her. Griselda took a bag of powder and put it in a cup of water so Mrs. Beakley would lose her voice but [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]] drank it by mistake and lost his voice. At the end of the episode, Yorik said he would teach his wife to be a good queen and teach her to share with the outsiders.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nShe has long, blonde hair, wears a jeweled crown, wristlets, and bracelets, necklace, and pink dress.\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Griselda, Queen}}\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
