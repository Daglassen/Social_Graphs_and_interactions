Now I will raise the safety bar, and a ghost will follow you home. Ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa.|The [[Ghost Host]]|The Haunted Mansion}}\n\nThe '''Hitchhiking Ghosts''' are a trio of infamous hosts that are located near the end of [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|The Haunted Mansion]] in the [[Disney Parks|Disney theme parks]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are three resident spirits of the Haunted Mansion known as '''Phineas''' (A.K.A. '''The Traveler'''), '''Ezra''' (A.K.A. '''The Skeleton'''), and '''Gus''' (A.K.A. '''The Prisoner'''). As hitchhiking ghosts they use their ghostly powers to haunt mortals that cross paths with [[Haunted Mansion (location)|the mansion]], working to fill up a quota from [[Ghost Relations Department|mansion officials]].\n\n===Development History===\nThe three got their semi-official names from a cast-member created backstory for the mansion called The Ghost Gallery. Since the story's creation, the names have been frequently affiliated with the trio in merchandise and the ride itself.\n\nIn [[2011]], [[Walt Disney World]] began further characterizing the trio in the attraction. Phineas' character was inspired by [[John Candy]] and Chris Farley, Ezra was inspired by [[John Cleese]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Michael Keaton]], while Gus was inspired by [[Christopher Lloyd]]'s character from the sitcom Taxi.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are the, \"Poster Ghosts\" for the Haunted Mansion, appearing in most promotional materials and posters for the ride.\n\nIn all versions of the ride (except [[Phantom Manor]] and [[Mystic Manor]]), the trio appear in the exit crypt to haunt guests as they leave the mansion as the Ghost Host explains their nature. Each of the ghosts appear alongside the guests in mirrors showing their [[Omnimover|Doom Buggies]]. In the [[Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] versions of the attraction this is achieved with a semi-transparent mirror that has doom-buggies with Hitchhiker AA figures on the other side. In the [[Magic Kingdom]] this was replaced with a CGI effect in 2011 that allowed them to move more freely at the expense of the figures' visibility.\n\nGus is the only one of them to consistently make an additional appearance in the ride, being found in the graveyard alongside [[the Executioner]] and the [[Beheaded Knight]]. In Walt Disney World, the three have tombstones visible outside of the Haunted Mansion.\n\n===[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]===\nIn the first couple years of Haunted Mansion Holiday, the trio could be visible from a window in the distance which [[Lock, Shock and Barrel]] were peering through. They are also mentioned attempting to hitchhike a ride in [[Jack Skellington|Jack]]'s sleigh but being denied.\n\n===[[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]===\nIn ''Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom'', they have their own spell card called \"The Haunted Mansion's Happy Haunting Grounds\". It was only available to guests that attended [[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]] in the fall of [[2013]].\n\n===[[Theme Park Characters|Meet 'n' Greets]]===\nThey rarely appear as face characters, only appearing during events such as the ride's 40th Anniversary.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===Film===\n\n====''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''====\nIn the made-for-DVD compilation movie ''Mickey's House of Villains'', they are freed from a crate by [[Cruella De Vil]] and join the villains in the song ''[[It's Our House Now!]]'' as they take over the House of Mouse. Aside from scaring the guests, they do not appear to be doing anything bad and are just happy to scare the guests.\n\n====[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|''The Haunted Mansion'' (film)]]====\nThe hitchhiking ghosts make a cameo appearance in the graveyard scene of this film. Phineas and Gus later hitch a ride in the hearse of [[Jim Evers]] before annoyingly bantering about whether or not Jim can see them, a gag on their invisible nature from the original ride but of unclear reference without knowledge of the source material.\n\n===Television===\n\n====''[[House of Mouse]]''====\nThe ghosts appear in several episodes of this show. They were shown when [[Pete]] told [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] that the club was \"deader than the Haunted Mansion\". At the end of the advertisement for \"The 7 Deadly Singers\", a warning tells the audience to \"Beware of ticket scalping ghosts.\".\n\nThe ghosts' most noticeably in the episode \"[[House Ghosts]]\", where they are freed from a crate by [[Pete]] and sing \"[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]\" along with other residents of [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|The Haunted Mansion]] such as the [[Bride]], the [[The Executioner|Executioner]], and the [[Hatbox Ghost]], as well as the [[Lonesome Ghosts (characters)|Lonesome Ghosts]] and the [[Skeletons]] from ''[[The Skeleton Dance]]''. During the number, they scare [[Pete]] out of the club.\n\n====''[[Muppets Haunted Mansion]]''====\nThe trio appear at the end of the [[Disney+]] special, hitching a ride with Gonzo and Pepe. Upon seeing them while having a phone conversation with the two, Kermit suggests bringing them over for breakfast.\n\n====[[Disney XD]] Shorts====\nEzra appeared, oddly without Phineas and Gus, in a stop-motion animated ''Disney XD'' station ID aired in October [[2016]], in which [[Star Butterfly]] and [[Marco Diaz]] have a run-in with him.\n\n====''Followed from the Mansion''====\nPhineas appears in this short, haunting a child who was followed home from the Haunted Mansion.\n\n===Printed Materials===\n\n====The Ghost Gallery====\nThe Ghost Gallery was an unofficial series of Haunted Mansion character biographies created by Disney World cast members in an effort to add more mythos to the attraction. This story proved so popular that it was responsible for inspiring the plot of the SLG Comics and created the hitchhikers' official names, those being Phineas, Ezra, and Gus.\n\n'''Professor Phineas Queeg''' was a discredited chemist turned snake-oil peddler who was committed to the New Salem Insane Asylum after having sold a \"miracle elixir\" which caused the voice of the one who drank it to raise an octave. Phineas wound up escaping with Ezra and Gus and they hitchhiked away together. The professor died from lead poisoning after he cut his lip on one of his elixir bottles.\n\nThe Ghost Gallery's backstory for Ezra the skeletal hitchhiker is considered inappropriate and features mature implications that gives his character perverted characteristics, and the story features misogynistic weight-shaming. In the backstory, '''Ezra Dobbins''' was a disgusting criminal who enjoyed stalking overweight women, breaking into their homes and watching them as they changed. After having been arrested for breaking into the boudoir of the mayor's ample daughter was sent to the New Salem Insane Asylum because the judge and jury believed he must be insane due to his interest in overweight women. Ezra wound up dying while peeping on the \"Fat Lady\" of a circus when she accidentally sat on him.\n\n'''Gus Gracey''' was a genetic dwarf from [[Ohio]] who, as a child, killed his family pets and attempted to murder his siblings on several occasions. His parents ultimately had him institutionalized in the New Salem Insane Asylum but he eventually grew up and wound up hunting down his parents and subsequently murdered them. Gus then shipped himself inside of a crate to his cousin George Gracey's mansion in an effort to kill him, only to be imprisoned in one of the mansion's secret rooms. When the mansion was inherited by George's son [[Master Gracey]], Gracey had his clairvoyant [[Madame Leota]] place a curse on Gus to imprison him on the mansion's grounds. Gus wound up dying while trying to throw his ball and chain at a cat sitting by a well, resulting in Gus' iron ball falling down the well, killing him.\n\n====[[The Haunted Mansion (comic book)|The SLG ''Haunted Mansion'' comics]]====\nThey appear in the main story as well as all of the bonus and side stories. They never say anything but attempt to hitchhike. They succeed at one point but scare the cab driver, killing him, and wind up back at the mansion with the cab driver joining them as a new resident. Each ghost got a side-story telling of their lives before they came to the Mansion.\n\nGus was a Shepard who only wanted to get some sleep but everywhere he went had bad luck until he was arrested in [[Port Royal]] until he died and found his way to the mansion. He soon wants to leave since the other ghosts parties keep him awake and join Ezra and Phineas.\n\n'''Ezra Gasser''' was a prankster since childhood that ran a successful practical joke business when he got older. Seeking out new jokes to help his business, he discovered Chinese finger traps from a mysterious salesman but found himself unable to free himself. He laughed himself to death and was then invited to the Mansion. However, his pranks made the other ghosts angry, resulting in him joining Phineas and Gus.\n\n'''Phineas Q. Hackenbush''' was a snake-oil salesman that was chased by an angry mob given snake tongues by his \"miracle cure\" product off a cliff. After being invited to the Mansion, he kept his business going, but when Madame Leota reminded everyone that they were already dead, and he was chased out, joining Gus and Ezra.\n\n====[[Disney Kingdoms: The Haunted Mansion|The Marvel ''Haunted Mansion'' comics]]====\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are also featured, in a more minor role, in the five-issue ''Disney Kingdoms'' tale. They take part in the various parties thrown by the ghosts and are also briefly turned into monsters by [[Captain Gore|the Captain]]. At the end of the story, they can be seen waving goodbye to [[Danny Crowe]], the protagonist.\n\n===Video Games===\n====[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]====\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are the main enemies for the Haunted Mansion levels of this video-game, being summoned by Madame Leota to fight the player. They also appear in cut-scenes, first warning the player not to enter the mansion and later trying to hitchhike with them as they leave.\n\n====[[Disney Crossy Road]]====\nAll three of the ghosts are playable characters in ''Disney Crossy Road'' where they are named '''Ezra Beane''', '''Prof. Phineas Plump''', and Gus. While playing as the Doom Buggy, they will appear as NPCs who attempts to hitchhike a ride with the player.\n\n====[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]====\nAs part of the mobile game's Halloween update for 2021, the three Hitchhiking Ghosts were added as unlockable characters, along with the [[Hatbox Ghost]]. The names used for the three Hitchhiking Ghosts are Ezra, Gus, and Phineas.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n==Trivia==\n*In Walt Disney World, Phineas and Ezra have hidden details in their luggage. Ezra has a brief-case which is covered in travel-stickers for [[Florida]], [[Hong Kong]], and 13 [[Anaheim]] (referencing different Disney Parks). Phineas has an open travel case containing a candelabra, urn, bust of Charles Dickens, and portrait of Cousin Maude from the Dread Family busts in the ride's queue.\n*In the Magic Kingdom's Jungle Cruise is a bottle labelled, \"Prof. Plump's Miracle Tonic for Everlasting Life\", seemingly referencing the traveller ghost's frequently used name ''Professor Phineas Plump'' and background as a snake-oil salesman from merchandise and the Ghost Gallery.\n*The [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version of ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]'' features three Audio-Animatronic droids (one being a former [[RX-24]] from the original [[Star Tours]]) positioned near the end of the queue in a manner similar to the Hitchhiking Ghosts.\n*Phineas the traveler has been misidentified in merchandise on two separate occasions. One piece of merchandise identified him as Brother Dave from the family-plot while another one identified him as Phineas Pock, a name frequently used in the mansion (most notably for the [[The Singing Busts|singing bust]] Phineas P. Pock).\n*In [[Phantom Manor]] their niche was filled in by [[the Phantom]] and later [[Melanie Ravenswood|M\u00e9lanie Ravenswood]] in a [[2018]] refurbishment. There is a ticket-seller in Phantom Canyon who shares the, \"Leering Head\" mould which Ezra has, resulting in the character being nicknamed Ezra as-well.\n*Gus appears to be inspired by [[Jacob Marley]] from [[A Christmas Carol]].\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n{{Disney Kingdoms}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Disney Dream Portrait Series characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
