Monkton is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Monkton is an retired resident of the Snowfield Stable who will ask Link if he will listen while Monkton tells a story. If Link inquires about the story, Monkton will reminisce about his childhood, noting there weren't other kids around and he will recall playing with his friends, Harry and Mary. When asked about Harry, Monkton will recall daring Harry to go into a maze that he had been warned was too dangerous, which was the last time Monkton ever saw Harry. Monkton's memory of Mary was also the last time he saw her. When trying to explore and search for the ruins at the base of the nearby Tanagar Canyon, despite being warned it was  too perilous, Mary tragically slipped and fell down the cliff. After listening to both stories, Monkton tells Link that he overcame the grief that came from losing his friends and reveals that two descendants of Harry and Mary are in the stall beside the Stable as Harry and Mary were both Horses. While he may no longer grieve for them, Monkton is still plagued by his memories with Harry and Mary, thinking about them even while he sleeps.
