He is the primary antagonist of the episode \"[[Feminine Air]]\".\n\n==Role in the episode==\nCool Hands Luke is a polar bear pilot with an attitude. He makes fun of the fact that [[Higher for Hire]] is run by [[Rebecca Cunningham|a woman]] and presses the issue to drive away business for the company. His winning streak in the Air Scavenger Race (achieved through cheating) was broken when Rebecca and [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] (in his \"Tan-Margaret\" persona) beat him and revealed him to be a fraud.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Luke, Cool Hands}}\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
