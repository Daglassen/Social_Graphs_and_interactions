Akrah is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Akrah is one of three Hylians who can be found at Serenne Stable debating the cause of the leviathans' extinction, the other two being his brothers Onya and Garshon. He theorizes that the leviathans went extinct to a volcanic eruption. However, while of the three scientists have been able to locate the remains of any leviathans, they do have an idea of where to find them. Akrah will ask Link if he's willing to travel to these locations to find the bones and return with a picture. He also asks that these pictures include the heads of the animals. He will offer a reward of 300 Rupees, and accepting will activate the "Leviathan Bones" Side Quest.
The specific leviathan Akrah wants to see is the Eldin Great Skeleton, which is located in the region of Eldin. Link can take a photo of it with the Camera Rune. When he shows the picture to Akrah, he will be shocked at the quality. With the picture, he believes he'll be able to prove his theory about the volcanic eruption. If Link hasn't delivered pictures to Onya or Garshon by the time he speaks to him, Akrah will ask Link to assist in their research as well. If Akrah is the last scientist to have his photo delivered, he will be the one to give Link his reward.
After the quest is completed, Akrah will continue to debate the leviathans' extinction with his brothers. He will explain that he's using the picture Link provided to his theory about the leviathans. At night, he mutters about heat in his sleep. On rainy days, he and his brothers stay inside the stable, and Zumi joins in on their conversations. He says they like to stay inside during rainy days, but quietly admits that it gives him a chance to talk with Zumi.
