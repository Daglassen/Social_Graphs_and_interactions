Lyndae is allowed into Gerudo Town despite being a man.<ref name=\"Men\">{{Cite|Hang on... I thought men weren't allowed in this town... Why did they let me in?|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Lyndae during the day, he incorrectly pronounces ''Sav'otta'' as \"Sabotta\", which is a {{Term|BotW|Gerudo (Language)|link}} greeting meaning \"good morning\".<ref>{{Cite|Er... Sa...botta? Was that it? I can't tell...|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref> Lyndae explains that one must really bite their lip to get the \"V\" sound out clearly and is ashamed that a little kid made fun of him for his pronunciation yesterday.<ref>{{Cite|Apparently you really have to bite your lip to get that V sound out clearly.|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|A little kid made fun of me yesterday for not being able to get the pronunciation right.|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref> He feels that it sounds the same no matter what he does.<ref>{{Cite|I don't know why, but it sounds the same to me no matter what I do...|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Lyndae at night, he struggles to say \"sav'saaba,\" which is the [[Gerudo]] word for \"good evening.\"<ref>{{Cite|Um...

When Link speaks to him here, Lyndae finally pronounces \"sav'otta\" correctly.<ref>{{Cite|Sav'otta! Hah! I got it!|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref> However, he still struggles with pronouncing \"sav'saaba,\" instead saying \"sav'saava\" and \"sab'saava.\"<ref>{{Cite|Sav'saava! Oh, wait... I think there's supposed to be a B sound there? Is it sav'saava? Sav'saaba? Ugh, this language is hard...|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref> Lyndae also expresses how shy he felt being surrounded by girls before Strade came to Gerudo Town.<ref>{{Cite|I was really shy, being all by myself and surrounded by girls like that.|Lyndae|BotW}}</ref> However, Lyndae admits that he still feels shy around Strade.<ref>{{Cite|Being honest...
