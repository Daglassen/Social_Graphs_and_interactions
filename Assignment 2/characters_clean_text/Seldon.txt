Seldon is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Seldon is a man who owns the Ventest Clothing Boutique in Hateno Village. He is the father of Sophie and formerly managed the Store, but has since left it in his daughter's care. In his free time, he offers Seldon's Village Tours for travelers visiting Hateno Village. He can be found pacing the road near the entrance to the village, awaiting visitors. Should Link refuse a tour, Seldon will make his disappointment clear with a sigh. If Link agrees to his offer, he will run across Hateno Village's thoroughfare, guiding Link to the various shops. As Seldon runs through the village, he has to urge himself forward and keep himself focused.
The first place Seldon guides Link to is East Wind, the Store opposite the Ventest Clothing Boutique. He then guides Link to the Kochi Dye Shop, a dyeing shop operated by Sayge. The third place Seldon directs Link to is The Great Ton Pu Inn, where Link can rest for the night. Completing the tour, Seldon brings Link to his own shop, welcoming him to visit when he has the time and stock up on Armor before visiting the Kochi Dye Shop. If spoken to again, Seldon will either tell Link that the tours will resume when he catches his breath, or that the tours are closed until he has had a rest. However, Seldon will not have the energy for another tour until the following day.
At 9 o'clock in the evening, Seldon will head home for the day, assuring Link that he can give him a tour in the morning. He sleeps on the bottom half of a bunk Bed and tends to grind his teeth as he sleeps.
If it rains in Hateno Village, Seldon will retreat to the interior of the Ventest Clothing Boutique and sit at the work station at the back of the store.
