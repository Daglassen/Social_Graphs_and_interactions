It's good to see you well. Would you like to hear the ancient verse passed down in this region? Excellent! Without further ado...|Kass|BotW}}</ref> When Link first meets Kass he introduces himself as a wandering minstrel, with a love for song. He travels the lands learning songs passed down within each region of Hyrule. He will offer to play songs related to the area Link encounters him in, the lyrics of said songs containing clues on how to unlock nearby hidden secrets.\n\nWhen spoken to at the [[Rito Stable]], he will confess that he is homesick, and wonders how his wife and children are doing back at [[Rito Village]].<ref>{{Cite|Ah, we meet again! I'm glad to see you in one piece. We're actually very close to my hometown of Rito Village, and I must admit I'm feeling incredibly homesick. I had to leave my wife and children back in the village. I'm sure they're doing just fine...|Kass|BotW}}</ref> Once Link solves the riddles in each of his songs, he returns to Rito Village, where he will remain by the flight platform next to [[Akh Va'quot Shrine]].<ref>{{Cite|I'm taking a moment's rest from my tireless search for the ancient songs to perform in my hometown.|Kass|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Ah, we meet again! I'm taking a moment's rest from my calling to enjoy some musical frivolity with my daughters. Though it may not be within my power, I commit my wish as song...that this peace might last forever.|Kass|BotW}}</ref> When visited at night, he will reveal that his teacher was a [[Sheikah]] poet who lived in [[Hyrule Castle]] before the Calamity struck and had an unrequited love for [[Princess Zelda]].<ref>{{Cite|My teacher was of the Sheikah tribe. He was the court poet for the Hyrulean royal family. At the time, there was a beautiful princess in the royal family, quite close to my teacher in age, apparently. Though he must have known it was doomed to be unrequited, my teacher fell in love with her...|Kass|BotW}}</ref> Kass will then play one final song which reveals that Link's near death was what finally unlocked Zelda's abilities.<ref>{{Cite|Her appointed knight gives his life, Shields her figure, and pays the price. The princess's love for her fallen knight awakens her power / And within the castle the Calamity is forced to cower.|Kass|BotW}}</ref> Afterwards, he tells Link that he is aware of his true identity as Zelda's appointed knight<ref>{{Cite|My teacher believed a hero would appear to beat back the Calamity. He poured that belief into a song. And that song is what I need you to hear. So...appointed knight. Will you accept this song from my departed teacher?|Kass|BotW}}</ref> and asks him to reaffirm that he will help Zelda save Hyrule.{{Fact}}\n\nAt each of the [[Stable]]s he is encountered at, he will play a version of [[Epona's Song]] that harmonizes with the stable theme that normally plays.<ref>{{Cite|Ah, we meet yet again! How are you holding up? In case you were wondering about the song I perform at the stables, there are many theories about its origin. But according to my teacher, it was a song performed by the ancient hero to call to his horse companion. If you ever feel like hearing it, feel free to drop by.
