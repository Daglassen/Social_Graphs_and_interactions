During the day on clear weather, she can be found at the Stable's patio next to its [[Barrel]]s. She tells Link that she has dreams of a land in the sky, and believes that people used to live there long ago.<ref>{{Cite|I sometimes see it in my dreams. Do you think that a long time ago people used to live in the sky? I think so...|Shamae|BotW}}</ref> She desires to watch balloons float high into the sky and asks Link if he could help her realize her dream.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, mister! For once in my life, I want to see {{Color|BotW Red|balloons}} float right up into the sky!|Shamae|BotW}}</ref> She promises to give him a treasure she got from the sky,<ref>{{Cite|If you'll help me realize my {{Color|BotW Red|balloon}} dream, I'll give you a treasure I got from the sky as thanks!|Shamae|BotW}}</ref> and instructs that he put some balloons onto one of the Barrels.<ref>{{Cite|Thank you! Now put some {{Color|BotW Red|balloons}} onto a barrel and make it float up high!|Shamae|BotW}}</ref> This initiates the \"[[Balloon Flight]]\" [[Side Quest]]. Link completes her request by attaching an [[Octo Balloon]] to one of the Barrels and allowing it to fly high enough. Overjoyed, she confesses that her dream is to visit the land in the sky by balloon.<ref name=\"Dream\">{{Cite|I want to visit the land in the sky by {{Color|BotW Red|balloon}}. Then, I'm going to ride a really big bird. Yep, that's my dream!|Shamae|BotW}}</ref> She then gives him the promised treasure: a [[Star Fragment]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Shamae's dream of an ancient land in the sky may be a reference to [[Skyloft]].  She also dreams of riding a \"really big bird\" there, which may refer to Skyloft's [[Loftwing]]s.<ref name=\"Dream\"/>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |characters= BotW\n}}\n\n[[de-niwa:Shamae]]"
