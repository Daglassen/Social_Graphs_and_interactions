Aladdin tells everyone that he's an adventurer, saying that he fought a [[Samir the \"Destroyer\"|giant dancing rhino]]. While he and Abu pretend to fight, Aladdin accidentally makes a mess in front of everybody; including Daru as well (all burned, smudged, and messed up), to his annoyance.\n\nThe next night, at the palace dining room, Aladdin (now learning to be as cultured as Daru and having his hair combed and slicked exactly like his own hair) and the others are eating with the same guests from before. Daru and the other guests are now impressed with the street rat. Later, Aladdin and his friends try to investigate a giant centipede which has been shooting fire on sand in the desert, thus, turning sand into glass. The centipede reveals itself to be another one of [[Mechanicles]]' inventions with Mechanicles himself controlling it with the intention of \"ironing the desert.\" After Mechanicles captures Aladdin and his friends, he reveals that Daru had sold him the iron; making the gang realize that the merchant sold out\u00a0[[Agrabah]] to get rich. Iago also reveals that his charm is also a fraud he picked up the same way Aladdin picked up his cultured behavior: Keeping his hair neat and making witty quotes that make no sense that he read from a scroll Iago lent him. After foiling Mechanicles' plans, [[Razoul]] makes Daru put broken pieces of the centipede in a cart as punishment for his treason, while Aladdin, Jasmine, and Abu are watching, making Aladdin sarcastically state that it'll take him about \"ten or fifteen years\" to clean this mess up.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nDaru1.jpg\nDaru2.jpg\nDaru3.jpg\nDaru4.jpg\nDaru5.jpg\nDaru6.jpg\nDaru7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tavelevil, Daru}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
