They are are creatures who are obsessed with all kinds of candies, living in the\u00a0Enchanted Forest. In the episode \"[[Big Rock Candy Flim-Flam]]\", there are two Candy Sprites, Sweetie (voiced by\u00a0[[Sherri Stoner]]) and Tangy (voiced by\u00a0[[Deanna Oliver]]), who search for\u00a0Grandmommers Whimsical's fudge and\u00a0the 7D's big rock candy.\n\n==History==\nThe Candy Sprites cause the explosion of a huge candy rock needed to power the\u00a0Tick Tock Clock Tower, the source of time for\u00a0Jollywood. All time halts, causing Grandmommers Whimsical to stand still at her\u00a0Sky Bucket\u00a0on her way to Queen Delightful's\u00a0castle\u00a0around midnight. To avoid Jollywood being stuck at midnight forever, the 7D locate another candy rock at their\u00a0mine\u00a0and transport it to the clock on their train. The replacement catches the eyes of the Candy Sprites, and they proceed to rob the 7D's train. The dwarves fend them off, and they successfully install the replacement candy rock at the tower. Whimsical finally arrives at her great-great-great granddaughter's, and together they commence a candy party, enticing the sprites once more, and the sprites took some of the candy with them.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The 7D}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The 7D characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
