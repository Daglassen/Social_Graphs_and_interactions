Of the two girls, Amber's the more dominant and intelligent one of the two, and she also has a much better singing voice\u00a0than Ashley. Both girls are shown to be huge fans of\u00a0Hannah Montana.\n\nIt is eventually revealed that up until she started middle school, Amber used to be \"the geeky kid with the glasses\" who everyone bullied, which is her most embarrassing secret (that even Ashley doesn't know, even though she's supposed Amber's best friend). From that, it can be assumed that Amber's mean and sour disposition probably stems from her getting\u00a0bullied all the time as a kid.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Hannah Montana}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Addison, Amber}}\n[[Category:Hannah Montana characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Singers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
