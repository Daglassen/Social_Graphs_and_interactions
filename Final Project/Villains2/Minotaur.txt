He is a large humanoid bull who resided in and endless maze within the city of Knossos, the capital of Crete.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''===\nIn the film, [[Hades]] sends him, the Griffin, and [[Stheno]] to gang up on [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]], but all three of them were defeated by a punch each from Hercules in less than a few seconds. The Minotaur was at the bottom of the pile when they landed, followed by the Griffin, then Stheno.\n===[[Hercules (video game)|''Hercules'' (Video Game)]]===\nIn the Hercules video game, the Minotaur serves as somewhat of a mini-boss. He stands at the top of a flight of stairs and throws objects down at Hercules. Hercules must find other objects in the area to throw back at him. \n\n===[[Hercules (TV series)|''Hercules'' (TV series)]]===\nIn the animated series, Hercules encounters another Minotaur in \"[[Hercules and the Minotaur]]\" and \"[[Hercules and the Grim Avenger]]\". In these appearances, the Minotaur is depicted as a sophisticated yet easily frustrated monster. He comes from Crete and enjoyed causing mayhem and destruction on the island. When Crete's King [[King Minos|Minos]] finally captured him, he requested [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]] to build a large maze to keep the Minotaur imprisoned. However, the insane king only wanted to use the maze for entertainment by throwing innocent people into the maze so they could be hunted by the Minotaur.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMedusa Griffin Minotaur Pawns.png|The Minotaur as a pawn piece in the film.\nMedusa Griffin Minotaur Defeated.png|Minotaur defeated in the film. \nMinotaur Hercules.png|Minotaur in the SNES game. \nMinotaur (Hercules).png|The Minotaur in the animated series.\nMinotaurBaby.JPG|The Minotaur as a baby\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*In the original storyboard for \"[[Zero to Hero]]\", the Minotaur does fight Hercules in the same way he does in the film, but instead of the Griffin and Stheno (who in the original storyboard was fought instead of Ceto), a huge green fish with a unicorn horn and a giant lobster helped the Minotaur fight Hercules.\n*In the original myth, the Minotaur was the stepson of King Minos, but in the animated series, there is no mention of the two being related.\n*In the film, the Minotaur had red eyes, white straight horns, and lacked clothing and facial hair, and in the episode \"Hercules and the Parents Weekend\", he had purple skin as an infant (although this may be due to a lack of fur).\n*According to the episode \"Hercules and the Grim Avenger\", the Minotaur was locked away in the Labyrinth because he got clumsy in a china shop. This is a reference to the phrase \"a bull in a china shop\".\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Cattle]]\n[[Category:Minotaurs]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]"
