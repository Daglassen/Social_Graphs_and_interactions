He is an evil fungus that is able to take over the mind of his host.\u00a0\n\n==History==\nApothecary Gary made his only appearance in the episode segment \"[[Children of the Spore]]\" as the main antagonist. Prior to the events of the episode segment, Apothecary Gary took control of a local frog named Lloyd. He later encountered [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]] and tricked him to having a jar of elixir that would make [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]], and [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] behave better. However, unbeknownst to Hop Pop, the \"elixir\" is actually a concoction of mind-control spores.\u00a0\n\nSlowly, the spores took over Anne, Sprig, Polly, and the rest of the Wartwood residence (except for Hop Pop and [[Bessie (Amphibia)|Bessie]]). After revealing his true self and motive, Gary battled Hop Pop in Bessie's stable. Eventually, Gary was eaten alive by Bessie after she ate the rest of his mushrooms, breaking his control over the other Wartwood residents, despite his pleads that his species would become extinct. Despite this, some of his spores survived and took control of Hop Pop's beetle Jeremy, which grew another mushroom resembling Gary.\u00a0\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nApothecary Gary, in his fungus form, resembles a large purple mushroom with light blue spots that flashes as he speaks. His host's eyes turn bright purple with light pink pupils.\u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gary's species seems to be based on the [[wikipedia:Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis|amphibian]] (''Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis'') and [[wikipedia:Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|salamander]] (''Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans'') [[wikipedia:Chytridiomycota|chytrid]] fungi, both of which causes the disease [[wikipedia:Chytridiomycosis|Chytridiomycosis]] in amphibians; as well as [[wikipedia:Entomopathogenic fungus|entomopathogenic fungi]] that controls their victims' brains and sprouts out of their bodies.  \n*Apothecary Gary is the first major character (excluding the dangerous wildlife)\u00a0in the series to not be an amphibian but rather an non-animal being.\u00a0\n**He is also the first major Amphibia character to die on screen.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
