Besides there's more than one way to pluck a chicken: Psychology! Why should I just get one when I can get 'em all?!|Foxy Loxy}}\n'''Foxy Loxy''' is the main antagonist of the [[1943]] animated short, ''[[Chicken Little (1943 short)|Chicken Little]]''. His motive is to simply eat all of the birds living within the gated farm yard.\n\nThis sneaky character uses his Psychology book and his own manipulative abilities to lure the chickens, turkeys, geese, and ducks into his cave, where they would meet their inevitable doom.\n\nHe is one of the only few Disney villains who succeeds in his evil plans and does not suffer poetic justice in the end (not to mention teaches a lesson to viewers).\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to [[Leonard Maltin|Leonard Maltin's]] introduction to the on the [[Walt Disney Treasures]] DVD ''Walt Disney On the Front Lines'', Foxy Loxy was originally going to read out of Adolf Hitler's book ''Mein Kampf''. This was changed to just a book simply entitled \"Psychology\"; however, the passages that Foxy reads are still from ''Mein Kampf''.\n*Also, the graves of the birds were originally going to be marked with swastikas, but Walt Disney decided to change the graves to just wishbones and to replace ''Mein Kampf'' with a generic psychology book, all in an attempt to prevent the [http://r.yieldkit.com/v1/redirect?type=intext&adId=YIELDNET.2.1180822328166209004&adType=product&api_key=ec0405c882a14d54be2c78e3a51df258&site_id=519b222ce4b0ba3cc21606b6&criterionId=Chicken+Little+%281943+short%29+-+Disney+Wiki+Wikia+Wikia+Navigation+The+Disney+Wiki+Navigation+Chicken+Little+%281943+short%29+Recent+Wiki+Activity+Videos+Photos+Live%21+Chat+6+Around+Wikia%27s+network+Wikia+Inc+Navigation&criterionId=short&source=http%3A%2F%2Fdisney.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FChicken_Little_%281943_short%29 short] from becoming dated after the war. Similarly, the ending was also intended to have Foxy Loxy directly reference the book by saying, upon being stuffed from Chicken, \"That's how it ends in ''Mein Kampf''!\" in reference to the narrator's shock at how this ending was different from the various fairy tale books, though this got changed for presumably the same reason as the other direct Nazi references.\n*He also bears an extremely similar resemblance to Foxy the Pirate from Scott Cawthon's Five Nights at Freddy's and may be a source of inspiration.\n*He is also similar to [[Honest John]], as both are villainous foxes who receive no form of defeat whatsoever.\n*He is depicted in a significantly more villainous manner in this rendition of the tale, as he was directly responsible for causing Chicken Little to declare the sky to be falling in this as part of his plan to eat all the fowl. In the original tale, Foxy Loxy had no real role in causing Chicken Little to think the sky was falling (as he merely got hit by an acorn), and merely did the action of luring the fowl to be his dinner due to the opportunity presenting itself in the form of Chicken Little's declaration and the fowl being panicked.\n*He is so far one of the very few [[Disney Villains]] to have succeeded.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nFoxyloxey.jpg\nChicken little 5large.jpg\nChicken little 7large.jpg\nChicken little 12large.jpg\n124-018aim.jpg\n124-015bosomy.jpg\n124-014turnabout.jpg\n124-011thinking.jpg\nTumblr_nhn5xlEkcz1qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg\nTumblr nk3a441Knz1r3jmn6o3 1280.png\nTumblr nk3a70eF2J1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nFoxy-loxy-model-600.jpg\nFoxy-Chicken-Little-end-book.jpg\nFoxy-cel.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Foxy Loxy}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Foxes]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
