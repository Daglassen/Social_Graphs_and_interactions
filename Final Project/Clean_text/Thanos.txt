and highly evolved race beings with incredible strength and lifespans that lasted several millennia Thanos was born the son u2019lars the leading members the Titan u2019s leadership Among his race Thanos was born with physical deformities that caused him considered outcast and shunned his fellow Titans This included his father u2019 u201dlars whom had strained relationship with Despite this treatment Thanos deeply cared about his people and sought become scientist order help them Sometime during his youth Thanos u2019s younger brother Starfox Eros left Titan search adventure through the Universe leaving Thanos and their father behind Seeking accomplish his dream being accepted his people Thanos tried save them when discovered that Titan was facing cataclysmic disaster due overpopulation suggested culling numbers eliminating half the population even offering the first eliminated that the other half could have enough resources survive His idea however was considered too drastic both the planet u2019s government and people who exiled him from Titan for his suggestion Ultimately Thanos warning was proven correct Titan was devastated internal conflict and resource exhaustion that turned into uninhabitable wasteland and the Titan race extinct including his father u2019lars Ironically Thanos u2019s exile saved him from his species u2019s destruction making him and his brother the only survivors their race and homeworld After the fall Titan Thanos traveled the universe for several years During this time traveled many worlds including Xandar many which also suffered from environmental problems caused overpopulation and resource abuse Upon seeing this Thanos became convinced that other worlds would share Titan u2019s fate until eventually resulting the end all life the universe u2019s growing population was not put check Thus Thanos made his life goal bring balance the universe wiping out half all its sentient life this became fearsome intergalactic warlord traveling many planets using his skills form huge alien armies invade other worlds and wipe out half their intelligent populations earned such fearful reputation that became considered among the most not the most powerful and influential being the universe ruling over distinct region space and gaining control over the deadly armies the Chitauri the Outriders and large numbers Saakaran mercenaries His reputation was fearsome that most galactic communities came call him u201cthe Mad Titan u201d name despises while his most loyal minions referred him u201cthe Dark Lord u201d Both the Kree and Nova Corps Nova empires the galaxy leading superpowers were well aware Thanos u2019s power and never dared cross him during his conquests knowing full well that they could not defeat him Thus Thanos was the few beings that the Kree known for their militarism power and supremacism truly feared also occasionally collected and trained orphans from some the species balanced become loyal lieutenants and they eventually considered him their father although felt real affection for them When balancing Zen Whoberi Thanos attention was caught young girl named Gamora Impressed how she fought off his guards Thanos took her aside and distracted her with special knife while his army massacred half the Zehobereis then adopted her and grew genuinely care for her unlike his other children Thanos also massacred half the Luphomoids and adopted another girl Nebula Thanos was known for being very cruel her for being weaker than Gamora and always modified her with cybernetics whenever she fail battle against Gamora attempt strengthen her resolve Nebula would grow hate Thanos for this Thanos eventually realised there were far too many planets the universe for him balance through military strength alone Thus realised that the Infinity Stones objects immense power that held considerable dominance over the various forces that occupied existence could overcome this and balance all the universe once Thus forged several alliances order locate them successfully located least the stones the Mind Stone which then hid inside Scepter that was capable manipulating minds Through many years searching Thanos discovered lead the Orb location sending Nebula and Gamora the Cloud Tombs Praxius under the command his ally the Kree soldier Korath the Pursuer Nebula fell victim trap during the mission and Thanos not tolerate failure forbade Gamora from rescuing her Nebula was forced amputate her own arm order escape The Orb was never recovered but Thanos let the failure pass and resumed his search Thanos also sent Gamora and Nebula find the Soul Stone but Gamora reported him that she was unsuccessful Thanos being perceptive ever was easily able see through the charade but let her believe that was fooled Although regarded many the most cruel arrogant destructive deranged and evil being the universe Thanos actually much more complicated and tortured individual due his tragic past and his obsession with achieving what believes his destiny his youth Thanos was once truly compassionate person who profoundly loved his people and homeworld Despite their prejudice towards him because his deformity Thanos bared grudge towards his fellow Titans only desiring day earn his people u2019s respect and accepted them Even during this time however Thanos had streak ruthlessness and strong utilitarian mindset This was shown attempted convince Titan u2019s government eliminate half the planet u2019s sentient population order save the other half from extinction Thanos even showed tremendous bravery was even willing volunteer himself the first the decimated population eradicated After Titan u2019s fall Thanos was left emotionally and mentally traumatized the loss his people and homeworld coming develop pessimistic outlook life Due the circumstances surrounding his people extinction and his planet destruction Thanos firmly believes that overpopulation will eventually destroy other planets until the entire universe left devoid life Believing his solution could have saved his people from extinction Thanos maintains that the only way prevent the universe u2019s destruction wiping out half all life Despite this shows some semblance honor stating that does not intend personally pick the victims instead deciding have his victims indiscriminately picked randomization After becoming warlord Thanos became extremely ruthless has massacred half the populations countless planets regardless whether the individuals were rich poor old young weak healthy has also killed unarmed enemies without mercy including children and infants confident himself the point near borderline arrogance though generally doesn u2019t underestimate enemies considers powerful Thanos also has little regard for the majority his servants being perfectly willing sacrificing many needs order accomplish his goals was completely unfazed when Ronan murdered the Other despite his centuries loyal servitude him also showed regards the deaths his adopted children Black Order after they were killed the Avengers showing that sees them mostly means end Despite this does have sense honor does not back his end deal when makes also despite having killed countless numbers them during his conquests has bit soft spot for children especially his favourite adopted daughter Gamora and ultimately does care deep down for his other adoptive daughter Nebula despite his brutal treatment her Thanos also has some care for his other adopted children well thought nowhere near the extent Gamora and Nebula Despite seeking out the Infinity Stones the most powerful objects existence Thanos only seeks use them correct the universe not rule dislikes those who seek power for selfish gain holding Loki selfish ambitions and Ronan personal grudge against the Xandarians contempt contrast respects and admires those who display selfless bravery including his enemies such Star Lord and Iron Man Despite often manipulating others Thanos shown have strong hatred for the concept lying much that never does himself showing that man his word addition his power Thanos incredibly intelligent with the Russo brothers even calling him the most intelligent being the MCU master tactician Thanos has vast knowledge military strategy evidenced how has successfully led his armies number successful campaigns and conquests also extremely patient having waited years after the stones until knew all their locations and whatever protections they may have Thanos also skilled scientist having designed
