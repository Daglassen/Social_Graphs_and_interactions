They appear as recurring obstacles who try to pursue after Jack Sparrow numerous times, but Jack always manages to escape.\n\n==Background==\nThe Redcoats wear red-sleeved uniforms with white cuffs and facings, including white pants, black boots, and tricorne hats. In addition to this, sailors and officers working for the Royal Navy wear blue uniforms.\n\nThe marines who work for the East India Trading Company wear red coats until [[Cutler Beckett]] retrieved the Heart of Davy Jones. The marines would later wear blue and red colored EITC-styked uniforms, who were known as Blue Coats, because of the colors of clothing they wore.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''===\nRedcoats are often seen stationing Fort Charles at [[Port Royal]] under command of [[James Norrington]] and guard the prison. As [[Gillette|Lieutenant Gillette]] notices [[Elizabeth Swann]] falling, he sends the redcoats to go rescue her; [[Jack Sparrow]] comes to the rescue and upon trying to rescue her, the redcoats try to shoot him, but Jack evades them. They later arrive at Mr. Brown's smithy where they found out that Jack Sparrow was knocked out and is later taken to prison. Following the attack of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' at Port Royal, the redcoats helped defend the town from the raid as well as [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] and his cursed crew.\n\nFurthermore, the redcoats joined battle and fight against the cursed crew raiding the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]''. Many of the redcoats suffered casualties during battle, but after the curse was broken, the pirates fighting with Barbossa's army were arrested. They later took part during the event where Jack Sparrow is to be killed via hangman's noose, but Will Turner freed Jack from the clutches of the executioner. With Jack freed, the redcoats prepare to stop Will Turner from escaping with Jack Sparrow who has escaped. Several of them were knocked out and when several surrounded the two, [[Elizabeth Swann]] prepares to help and under Norrington's orders, Jack managed to escape for rescuing Elizabeth.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===\nA large group of marines serve under [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]]'s command in the [[East India Trading Company]] wore red coats; the further marines who wore blue and red colored coats were known as blue coats who serve the EITC.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===\nThe marines still remain their duties at the EITC with Cutler Beckett still a loyal member as the EITC planned to eradicate piracy, but the plan failed due to the ''Pearl'' and the ''Dutchman'' destroying the ''HMS Endeavour'' with Lord Cutler Beckett in it.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]''===\nRedcoats serve their duties as guards under the rule of [[King George II]] in London. As Jack Sparrow and Joshamee Gibbs escaped the Old Bailey from an angry mob who wanted to see a pirate's hanging, the redcoats surround the two and are taken to King George's palace. As Jack wreaks havoc in King George's palace, the redcoats pursue Jack Sparrow, but later gets rescued by Captain Teague to avoid getting caught.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===\nThe redcoats are one of the victims who are under attack by [[Captain Salazar]], many of them taken out by Salazar's crew. Numerous redcoats reside in the town of Saint Martin and later notice Jack on a rope during the robbery of the bank at Saint Martin. Under command by Mayor Dix, a group of marines chase after Jack attempting to go after the runaway bank in a plan to get money, to which Jack manages to escape from them. The plan for the pirates to get money was unsuccessful after the bank was destroyed across Saint Martin, due to only one piece of gold coin obtained during the chase, causing Jack to lose faith in his crew. More marines also ended up chasing [[Carina Smyth]] who has been recently accused for witchcraft just as she manages to escape with [[Henry Turner]]. Having escaped, the marines are told to search for the victims that escaped across Saint Martin. After Mayor Dix captures Jack Sparrow who leaves the inn during a rainy night, some redcoats arrive and approach Jack Sparrow just as their mayor tells them that Jack Sparrow should be executed at dawn. The redcoats bring Jack to prison for attempting to rob the bank just as he is thrown in his prison cell before being executed by dawn. Henry Turner later wears a redcoat outfit to avoid getting spotted by the patrolling redcoats and plans to look for Jack Sparrow only to be grabbed by the real Jack himself, much to Henry's notice to him.\n\nThe next day, two redcoats bring Jack to execution to which he notices [[Uncle Jack]] happy to see him. He then has a brief conversation with his nephew just as Sparrow tells him that the redcoats are sentencing him for execution just before the two guards take him out of the prison and send him to execution. A group of marines are later present during the event where Jack Sparrow and [[Carina Smyth]] are sentenced to be killed for piracy and witchcraft (despite Carina claiming herself that she is not a witch) as an angry mob of townspeople are gathered to watch. As Jack and Carina continue talking, the mayor impatiently orders the marines to kill them both. Henry Turner arrives at the spot where Jack and Carina are at just as he fights off a few redcoats just as he orders Jack's crew to fire their cannon to save Jack from being executed by firing a cannonball at the execution platform just as the redcoats, the mob of townspeople, and the hangman notice this as Jack's crew continues fighting against the redcoats, much to the mayor's fury that the plan was disrupted just as the mob retreats from the ambush.\n\nJack's crew reloads the cannon they are using to destroy the execution platform, knocking a redcoat off the platform while Henry continues fighting against the hangman as Carina knocks him off the platform just as the rest of Jack's crew fight against the redcoats. Additionally, the guillotine the redcoats were using gets destroyed just as the execution platform Jack is at also gets destroyed as Jack continues taking on more redcoats alongside Joshamee Gibbs who fights a few more while Henry manages to save Carina Smyth. With Jack and Carina saved from execution, Jack and the rest of his crew as they continue their quest to find the Trident of Poseidon with Carina on board.\n\nA group of redcoats on board the ''Essex'' under command by Scarfield prepares to hunt down Jack Sparrow and his crew during their plan to find the Trident of Poseidon. They attempt to attack Jack's crew only for their ship to be destroyed by the ''Silent Mary'' controlled by Captain Salazar and his undead crewmen.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nGibbs-Jack-Redcoats.png|The Redcoats surrounding [[Jack Sparrow]] and [[Joshamee Gibbs]].\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Royal_Marines Redcoats] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki Pirates of the Caribbean  Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]"
