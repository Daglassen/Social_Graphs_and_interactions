Even me!|Dijon|DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp}}\n\n'''Dijon''' is a thief, and the secondary antagonist in ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]''. He also appeared in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' TV series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]''===\nIn the beginning of the film, Dijon works for [[Scrooge McDuck]] as a hired guide, but he is actually in service to his master, [[Merlock the Magician|Merlock]], who wants to reclaim the magic lamp stolen from him by Collie Baba. For much of the film, Dijon plays the role of comic-relief villain, with a running gag being the frequent loss of his pants.\n\nLater in the film, Dijon obtains the lamp and\u00a0becomes [[Gene the Genie]]'s new master (on Gene's suggestion, as he doesn't want to be taken back to Merlock), then wishes to take over possession of Scrooge's Money Bin. When Scrooge finds Dijon in the Money Bin\u00a0and confronts him about Gene, Dijon summons guards to eject Scrooge from the premises. After Merlock puts the talisman on the lamp, he notices Dijon under the rug and wishes for Genie to turn the poor thief into a pig. He is later turned back to normal after Merlock's defeat.\n\nAt the end of the film, Dijon attempts to escape the Money Bin after filling his pants with gold coins. Scrooge spots him and chases Dijon into town, screaming \"Somebody, stop those pants!\"\n\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\n[[File:Dijon&Beagle Boys.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dijon with [[Beagle Boys]].]]\nDijon later appeared in the ''DuckTales'' series. In \"[[Attack of the Metal Mites]]\", Flintheart Glomgold hires Dijon to deliver gold-eating metal mites to Scrooge, but his bumbling ends up causing the mites to escape, causing the episode's conflict and he ends up foiling the protagonists' efforts to stop the mites. In the end, he brings some of the mites back to Glomgold, though they begin eating his cash. Throughout the episode, he repeatedly mispronounces Glomgold's name, which really irritates Glomgold.\n\nIn the series' final episode, \"[[The Golden Goose]]\", Dijon encounters Scrooge in\u00a0a marketplace in India, but he ends up getting chased away by Scrooge and hides in a nearby temple. Inside, he meets with his brother [[Poupon]], leader of the Brotherhood of the Golden Goose, and is put in charge of guarding the priceless relic. However, Dijon's greed gets the better of him and he steals the goose, triggering a chain of events that ultimately\u00a0threatens to\u00a0petrify the entire planet into gold.\u00a0In the end, the crisis is averted and Dijon seems to have learned his lesson not to steal, but Scrooge ends up chasing him again when he learns that Dijon nabbed his watch.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\n[[File:Screen Shot 2019-04-27 at 6.58.18 PM.png|thumb|left|200px|D'jinn in DuckTales reboot.]]\nDijon appears in the reboot's second season episode \"[[Treasure of the Found Lamp!]]\", where he is renamed Faris D'jinn to sound more authentically Arabic. He has also been changed from a dog to a jackal. D'jinn comes from a long line of warriors who have protected a lamp for centuries before it was taken by Scrooge. It is revealed that the lamp is empty and the reason why they protect it is that they were descended from a genie who became a mortal when the woman he loved freed him. The character is more serious, competent, and heroic in this version.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtT4QHHt5N8</ref> \n\nD'jinn later makes a brief appearance in ''[[Moonvasion!]]'', where he and [[Amunet]] are seen dealing with the Moonlanders when they are attacking Egypt.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name in the original series comes from a type of French mustard.\n*His name in the 2017 series comes from djinn which is the original word for a genie.\n*Dijon is considered quite popular amongst the Ducktales fans, which may be why he was added in to the TV series.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n\n[[es:Dijon]]\n[[fi:Dijon]]\n[[it:Dijon]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
