Pruce is a character in Breath of the Wild. He manages Hateno Village's general store, the East Wind.


== Biography ==
Pruce is usually busy behind the counter of East Wind, sometimes neglecting to notice customers when they first come in. He takes a moment to make sure everything is in place before returning to the counter proper. When he is ready for business, he is open to conversation.
Link can mention he is here to purchase items and Pruce will explain how to do so. Should Link ask Pruce about himself, he will be startled at first, then move into introductions. At night, Pruce will also bring up his family. He will go on to mention that most of Hateno's villagers are friendly enough to speak with travelers. If Link asks to sell something, Pruce will be happy to oblige. Gaining anything makes Pruce quite happy, and although he is eager to buy, he assures Link that he is in no hurry.
If it is late, Pruce will make note of the time. Despite this, the shop remains open.
Once Link decides to leave the store, Pruce expresses the hope that he will return.
