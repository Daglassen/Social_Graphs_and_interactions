The Igneo Talus Titan is a boss in Breath of the Wild. It is exclusive to The Champions' Ballad DLC pack.


== Characteristics ==

The Igneo Talus Titan bears a striking resemblance to Igneo Talus, but is significantly larger and much stronger than its common counterpart. It is involved in one of the three trials of the "EX Champion Daruk's Song" Main Quest, in which Link must "stop a titan of molten stone." The Champion Daruk originally fought the Igneo Talus Titan to pass the same trial.
The Igneo Talus Titan appears at the northern shore of Lake Darman, where it lies in the Lake's lava and emerges as it is approached. Its characteristics and attack patterns are for the most part identical to the common Igneo Talus; its body is encased in molten rock and it attacks by launching its arms at Link, which are then shortly regrown. It can also attack by slamming its arms into the Lake's lava, creating a fiery splash. Its heated body also creates updrafts of hot wind around it, which Link can use to glide over with the Paraglider to its weakness: the Ore Deposit protruding from the top of its head. However, coming in direct contact with the Titan's molten body will catch Link on fire. Thereby, Link can attack the Titan with ice Weapons to cool it down and stun it temporarily, or approach it while wearing the Flamebreaker Set if it has been enhanced twice by a Great Fairy for the Fireproof Set Bonus. Notably, the Igneo Talus Titan does not leave the Lake's lava, requiring that Link glides over if he intends to strike its weakness directly.
After the Igneo Talus Titan is defeated, the Kamia Omuna Shrine rises from the ground nearby, thereby completing the Titan's trial.
Like the Molduking, the defeat of the Igneo Talus Titan does not count towards its respective Medal of Honor.
