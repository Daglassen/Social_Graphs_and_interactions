They operated mainly be performing stagecoach and train robberies at gunpoint.\n\n=== Development History ===\nThe Bandido gang was created by [[Marc Davis]] for the proposed [[Walt Disney World]] attraction, the [[Western River Expedition]].  In this attraction, they would have been based along the Mississippi River near St. Louis and guests would have passed by them taking part in a stage-coach robbery with their leader playing a song on a guitar before warning guests that they'd rob them too down-river.  The bandidos would be true to their word, being found by the climax where they would be armed and waiting to open fire at the guests only for a forest-fire to assist in the guests' escape down a waterfall and into the caverns where the ride started.\n\nAfter the attraction's cancellation, the bandidos would become part of its lasting legacy in the Disney Parks.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== [[Legends of Frontierland: Gold Rush!]] ===\nThe illustration of a Bandido's face was used on maps to signify, \"The Hideout\", the meeting-place for denizens of [[Rainbow Ridge]].\n\n=== [[World of Motion]] ===\nTwo of the red-masked Bandidos appeared in this [[Epcot]] attraction in the scene dedicated to the invention of the railroad.  These outlaws are holding up a train at gunpoint to rob its passengers as the narrator talks about how safe railways were.  The vignette was inspired by Marc Davis concepts for the bandidos recycled from the WRE.\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n=== [[Disney Kingdoms]] ===\nIn this comic, the bandidos are major supporting characters with the protagonist [[Abigail Bullion]] even becoming one of them.  Rather than there traditional villainous appearances, here they are shown as anti-heroes who fight and rob the Big Thunder Mining Company due to the damage it causes to [[Big Thunder Mountain]] and its people such as the citizens of Rainbow Ridge.  One member named Onawa even being an indigenous woman whose people were killed and forced off their land by the company.\n\nAbigail Bullion would be kidnapped by them after she attempted to stop them from robbing the company due to it belonging to her father, [[Barnabas T. Bullion|Barnabas]].  She comes to join them initially to double-cross them but comes to learn of the Big Thunder Mining Company's true horrors, namely those being enacted by foreman [[George Willikers]].  After a confrontation within the mountain with Willikers, Abigail would reconcile with her father who would shut down the company with the people of Rainbow Ridge deciding to leave the land.  Abigail would also garner a romance with fellow bandido [[Jason Chandler]] who wished to build a [[Discovery Bay|new colony]] for the townsfolk revolving around innovation.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* The bandidos inspired an undead outlaw seen in the [[Thunder Mesa|Phantom Canyon]] segment of [[Phantom Manor]] at [[Disneyland Paris]].  While lacking a red bandanna, this outlaw is seen engaged in a stagecoach robbery while in a gunfight with an undead sheriff.\n* The bandits were likely inspired in-part by historic outlaw and stagecoach robber Charles E. Boles AKA Black Barty (1829-1888).  Black Barty used to be a walk-around character in [[Disneyland]]'s [[Frontierland (Disneyland)|Frontierland]] where he would engage in battle with characters like Sheriff Lucky or [[Pecos Bill]] at the [[Golden Horseshoe Saloon]].\n*The Bandito Gang is similar to [[Captain Gore]] and the the [[Mistress of Evil (character)|Mistress of Evil]] in that they are all antagonists in Disney Kingdoms comics who originate from unused scripts/attractions.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:B8i44V7IMAAluH-.jpg large.jpeg\nFile:WRE Canyon.jpg\nFile:Disney 1984 326.jpg\nFile:Big Thunder Moutain Railroad Issue 4 Textless.jpg\nFile:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Issue 2 Cover.png\nFile:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad 1 Cover.jpg\nFile:FLM795313.jpg|An outlaw's face over the hideout\n</gallery>{{Big Thunder Mountain Railroad}}{{Disney Kingdoms}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Characters]]\n[[Category:Unused concepts]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
