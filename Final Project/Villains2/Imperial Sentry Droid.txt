The consequences could be problematic.|AP-5}}The '''Imperial Sentry Droid''' is a hulking black security droid resembling a Stormtrooper used to protect the [[Galactic Empire]]'s cargo ships. Usually, they would only be activated one at a time aboard their vessel, but when one droid was attacked by a perceived threat, the others would also activate to attack the intruder.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Star Wars Rebels]]===\nImperial Sentry Droids appeared in the episode \"[[The Wynkahthu Job]]\", in which they attacked the crew of the Ghost when they sought to salvage supplies and treasure from an abandoned Imperial cargo ship in the upper atmosphere of the planet Wynkahthu. One captured both [[Azmorigan]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]] before they were rescued by [[Ezra Bridger]]. When they tried to hide from the droid, Azmorigan panicked and shot the droid, inadvertently awakening its companions. The droids then proceeded to attack them and the rest of the crew as they tried to steal as much ammunition and treasure as they were able until the cargo ship began to sink into the maelstrom of storms in Wynkahthu's upper atmosphere. As the Ghost and its crew escaped, the droids were left aboard and sucked into the storms below, destroyed alongside the vessel they had failed to protect.\n\nIn \"[[Through Imperial Eyes]]\"\u00a0Thrawn possesses two droids that tightly tightens him of training opponent.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Imperial Sentry Droids are modeled after Dark Troopers, a type of battle droid that appeared in the Star Wars \"Legends\" continuity, specifically the video game Star Wars: Dark Forces. Dark troopers came in three phases, with the third and last phase most closely resembling the Imperial Sentry Droid.\n*The override code\u00a0Thrawn\u00a0uses for his Imperial sentries was initially interpreted as either \"Rook,\" a reference to the chess piece and thus\u00a0Thrawn's tactical knowledge, or \"Rukh\", a reference to\u00a0Thrawn's Noghri bodyguard from the\u00a0''Legends''\u00a0continuity.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe Wynkahthu Job concept 2.jpeg\nStar Wars Rebels Season Three 18.jpg\nStar Wars Rebels Season Three 17.jpg\nThe Wynkahthu Job 23.jpeg\nImperial_Sentry_Droids.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:starwars:Imperial sentry droid|Imperial sentry droid on Wookieepedia]]\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Droids]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
