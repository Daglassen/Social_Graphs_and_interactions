Merc has [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and his friends help him capture the shark and he uses [[Abu]] and later [[Jasmine]] as bait for The Beast to eat them. When the shark gets out of the sand and flies over Merc's ship, everyone sees that his chest is covered with treasure. Later, when Aladdin and the others find Jasmine, the shark approaches them. They get on a rock and the Beast tries to get them off so he could eat them. The gang is then rescued by Merc. When Aladdin and the others make the shark approach them as Merc tries to kill him, the beast runs into a rock and becomes unconscious. When the gang goes back to the palace, that night they tie the shark in front of it. The next morning, Merc frees the shark and he swims away.\n\n====[[Beast or Famine]]====\nMerc is going after the shark and about to throw his harpoon at him. But the shark then gets caught by rat-like people's harpoons and he gets eaten by them. Only the shark's bones are seen for the rest of the episode. Aladdin, Abu, and Merc use the shark's bones as a new ship since Merc's old one got wrecked to go rescue [[Genie]] from the rat people's hostile leader, the [[Shaman]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Sharks]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]"
