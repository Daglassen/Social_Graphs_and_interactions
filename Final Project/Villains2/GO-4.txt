The elevator also granted GO-4 access to the captain's quarters.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHe is quite small and easily recognizable due to the red police light atop his body. His body weakly resembles that of an American football. GO-4 is equipped with two salute-ready arms and an anti-gravity stasis beam. For communication, he had various beeps and other sounds, similar to [[R2-D2]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''. GO-4 units also can deliver coffee to superiors.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''===\nHe is first seen descending a personal elevator near two activating Stewards. With beeps. he directs them to the docking area where the EVE's retreat for evaluation. \n\nHe scans them, even scanning WALL-E accidentally while founding a probe with positive results. As a robotic arm picks her up and places her to a MVR-A, GO-4 tells the Stewards to lead the MVR-A until it was carried to a People Mover. \n\nAs the MVR-A with the positive probe is brought to the Captain's quarters, he communicates with AUTO with a series of beeps, possibly about the secret directive A-113. \n\nAs AUTO's secret directive is found by the Captain, AUTO sends GO-4 to the quarters to attempt discarding the plant. He hisses to intimidate his enemies. As Wall-E is found from the garbage shoot, GO-4 traps EVE in his suspension beam.  \n\nHe was accidentally destroyed when he attempted to assist AUTO in taking down Captain B. McCrea and was kicked and sent flying through a window and crashing down near one of the swimming pools in the Lido Deck, obliterating him.\n\n===Other appearances===\nA GO-4 appears briefly in the short ''[[BURN-E]]'', which takes place during the events of the film.\n\nOne also appears in the [[WALL-E (video game)|video game]], but it\u00a0doesn't break.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nGO-4_2.jpg\nWALL-E-345.jpg\nWALL-E-347.jpg\nWALL-E-534.jpg\nWALL-E-676.jpg\nWALL-E-531.jpg|Attempting to destroy the plant by putting it in the escape pod\nWALL-E-675.jpg\nWALL-E-348.jpg\nWALL-E-686.jpg \nGO-4's death.png|GO-4 smashes right beside the pool.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*GO-4 is a pun on how personal assistants are often referred to as \"gophers/gofers,\" a verbal pun as they are often sent to \"Go for (GO-4) things.\"\n*When GO-4 is sent flying out of the window, he makes a whistling sound and a smash sound effect very similar to the sound [[wikipedia:Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] makes when falling off a cliff in ''[[wikipedia:Looney Tunes|Looney Tunes]]''.\n*According to the Pixarpedia, GO-4, like Auto, are not sentient, and therefore they lack technical alignment, as all they do are following orders since they can't think.\n\n==External links==\n\n* {{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|pixar|GO-4|Pixar Wiki}}\n{{WALL-E}}\n\n[[es:GO-4]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:WALL-E characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
