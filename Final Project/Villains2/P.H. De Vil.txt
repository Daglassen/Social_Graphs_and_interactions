According to his sales pitch, he's an \"evil genius, mad scientist, and junk food connoisseur.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===\nP.H. De Vil is considered to be the most brilliant of all the De Vils, though he is also one of the more successful De Vils. He has amassed his fortune through using science and technology to his advantage, though he also owns an ice cream factory. In \"[[Food for Thought]]\", he used [[Rolly]] as a test subject for his junk food business animal testing in order to determine the best flavors and the potential side effects that they contain.\n\nDue to his innate genius when it comes to technology, [[Cruella De Vil]] often employs P.H. in order to help her with her own schemes, in which P.H. manages to successfully defy the laws of physics in many instances to help her out. Unlike Cruella, however, P.H. doesn't have any qualms with people and he tends to help Cruella out just for the sake of using science, though he tends to head back to his home whenever he feels Cruella can handle any given situation on her own.\n\nIn his spare time, P.H. likes to participate in swap meets for his fellow mad scientists, though he also spends a lot of time repairing Cruella's television set, since he finds himself at her place every time she watches the news, as she tends to throw her remote at the television in anger.\n\nDue to the fact that he\u2019s helped her out for so long, P.H. De Vil is Cruella De Vil's closest relative and her loyal friend, though P.H. has his own ambitions that he wishes to one day be able to complete.\n\n===Episode appearances===\n*\"[[Food for Thought]]\"\n*\"[[Coup DeVil]]\"\n*\"[[DeVil-Age Elder]]\" (seen on portrait in De Vil family gallery)\n*\"[[Jurassic Bark]]\"\n*\"[[Good Neighbor Cruella]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*His initials reflects on him being a scientist and a connoisseur.\n**In chemistry, {{WikipediaLink|pH}} is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n**[[Wikipedia:Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] can also be used in culinary arts, which explains his use in mixing food with science.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFoodForThought09.jpg\nFoodForThought22.jpg|P.H. with Rolly\nFoodForThought23.jpg\nFoodForThought26.jpg\nRobo-Rolly05.jpg|P.H. with Cruella\nRobo-Rolly09.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"
