As a young man, believing himself to have never been treated with respect, he conspired with Esteban to help [[Shuriki]] take over Avalor, only to wind up being banished from the kingdom. He serves as the secondary antagonist in the second season and later the main antagonist for the rest of the season of the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. However, he reforms in \"[[The Lightning Warrior]]\", regretting his past actions and now desiring to help Elena defend Avalor.\n\n==Background==\nDuring [[King Raul and Queen Lucia|King Raul]]'s reign, Victor's father was the Royal Treasurer of [[Avalor]]. He and [[Chancellor Esteban]] would often race through the palace and Esteban would always finish second for which Victor nicknamed him El Segundo. Forty-one years ago, Victor and Esteban made a deal with an evil power-hungry sorceress named Shuriki: They would help her invade Avalor if she gave them power after she took over. However after she took over, Shuriki had Victor and his family banished from Avalor and made Esteban Chancellor. He later married a woman named Ash and they had a daughter named Carla. Ash later left to become a Malvago. Five years later, a severely weakened Shuriki came to Victor following her defeat at the hands of Princess Elena and Princess Sofia and renewed her alliance with him by promising to make him and Carla Dark Wizards in exchange for helping her regain her youth and powers.\n\n===Personality===\nVictor is an extremely ruthless, cruel, and selfish man who always makes trouble everywhere he goes. As noted by Francisco and Luisa, he's been a thief since he was a boy. He freely betrays anyone for the sake of his own personal gain as shown when he betrayed everyone in Avalor to help Shuriki gain power so she would name him Chancellor of Avalor. He's also shown to feel no guilt or shame about the harm he causes to fulfill his desires as shown when he was only upset that Shuriki banished him from the Kingdom and instead made Esteban Chancellor.\n\nFor all his ambition and ruthlessness however, Victor loves his daughter dearly, carrying her through a blizzard after she hurt her leg all the way to their cottage to get her warm and safe.\n\nHis main weakness is his ego as he can be tricked into making a wrong move by his enemies when they rub it the wrong way.\n\nHis reunion with his wife, Ash, is bitter though they hide their discontent with each other from Carla, as Victor is angry at Ash for not returning to him and their daughter when Ash was only supposed to be gone a year, and the fact she never contacted them led Victor to think Ash was dead, and he is aggravated how Ash excuses her actions and turns the argument around on him as she is angry that Victor raised their daughter without her. Though they come to an understanding and seem to make up, it quickly dissolves after Ash is shown to be dismissive of Victor's abilities as a Malvago compared to Carla's.\n\nWhen Carla nearly falls to her death, Victor decides that the two of them need to end their dark pursuits because they have endangered Carla, once again showing how much he cares about his daughter to the point of giving up his desires if it means keeping her safe. Unfortunately, Ash responds to this by turning him into stone.\n\nVictor is afraid of thunderstorms, as he fearfully clutches Carla in his arms when Hetz conjures one.\n\nSince Elena required the help of a Malvago to accomplish a task, she hesitantly gave Victor and Carla second chance, and the both of them took this chance for redemption, even declining Elena's original proposition and requested to aid her in stopping Ash. As a result, Victor and Carla found true redemption in renouncing dark magic to become good wizards and doing what was right. Victor himself restored the friendship he, Esteban, and Elena once shared when they were all children.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nVictor first appears in \"[[King of the Carnaval]]\" when he and his daughter [[Carla Delgado|Carla]] arrive at Avalor Palace. After Elena shows him the Royal Treasury and Carla steals the key from a sentry, Victor tries to steal the Crown Jewels but is stopped by the booby traps inside. Once back outside, He blackmails Esteban into helping him rob the Royal Treasury of [[Avalor]] by threatening to tell the Royal Family and the whole kingdom he helped Shuriki invade Avalor if he refuses. However, it's Elena that comes back out with the jewels. When Esteban comes back out, he explains Elena caught him and he had to give her the jewels to cover himself. Victor tells him to get the jewels back with their old sleight of hand tricks or he'll spill the beans about what he did to his family. To ensure that Esteban succeeds, Victor takes control of the float and gives the Royal Family a bumpy ride. When Esteban comes back with the jewels, Victor sees that Esteban didn't take back Queen Lucia's tiara. Esteban tells him that that's because Elena's wearing it and he'll be seen. Victor orders Carla to get rid of the others and take the tiara. Esteban tells him he has enough jewels to which Victor retorts \"The tiara is the only piece that matters. We're not leaving without it.\" To which Esteban bites back \"Then you are not leaving at all!\" and stops the coach. Furious, Victor drops the bomb about Esteban's betrayal to Elena. After Carla steals the tiara, Victor imprisons Elena and Esteban. However, Victor and Carla are stopped by the Carnaval Parade long enough for Elena and Esteban to instigate a chase. Victor and Carla are soon apprehended by Elena, her family, and her subjects. Elena banishes Victor and Carla forever. However, Victor vows to return for the tiara and get revenge.\n\nHe and Carla return in the special, ''[[Realm of the Jaquins]]'', they interfere in [[Nico]]'s guardian test, in order to get him sent back to the Jaquin realm of Vallestrella, allowing them to follow him and gain access. They do not manage to get into the portal before it closes but are given another chance when Elena and Luna use the portal to go and speak to [[King Verago]] and manage to make it through. Once there, they journey to a mountain location, using a map that was given to Victor by an old friend of his, and free a forest sprite named [[Marimonda]] to aid them in taking over Avalor.\n\nLater, the two wrecks a trap Elena sets and reveal that they are behind [[Marimonda]]'s release. Marimonda uses Migs to open the gate and the three of them go back to Avalor. However, unbeknownst to everyone, releasing Marimonda to invade Avalor was just a distraction and Victor and Carla's real plan was to give the magic jewel they removed to free Marimonda to his old friend: Shuriki. Shuriki uses the jewel's magic to restore her youth and promises to make the pair malvagos so they can conquer Avalor together.\n\nV\u00ecctor and Carla are turned into malvagos by [[Fiero]] in \"[[The Race for the Realm]]\" and continue to serve Shuriki until her death in \"[[Song of the Sirenas]]\". They are reunited with Carla's mother [[Ash Delgado]] in \"[[Snow Place Like Home]]\", though Victor is initially upset at her for not coming back to him and Carla for seven years, they make amends after Victor reveals that he has the Scepter of Night's jewel.\n\nIn \"[[Naomi Knows Best]]\", Victor, Ash, and Carla set up a trap for Elena by having a brainwashed [[King Joaqu\u00edn]] write a forged letter to her, lying that Victor and Carla have been captured in his kingdom. Once Elena arrives there with Esteban and Mateo, Ash reveals herself and imprisons Esteban, Mateo, and Joaqu\u00edn in a cell. She and her family plan to extract the magic inside Elena into the Scepter of Night's jewel, which will kill her, and use a spell on Elena that forces her to go with them. By sunset, Gabe and Naomi ambush them, but Ash is easily able to defeat them and plans to have Carla perform the magical spell with her, as she is a more powerful malvago than Victor, much to Victor's frustration, whom Ash entrusts with guarding the cells.\n\nThough Victor initially does a good job in guarding the cells, Naomi is easily able to outsmart him and tricks him into unintentionally freeing Esteban and Mateo. He has his tamborita taken from him, and Naomi has Esteban and Joaqu\u00edn keep an eye on him while she, Mateo, and Gabe confront Ash and Carla. While they succeed in foiling Ash and Carla's plans, the latter two manage to escape and plan to come back for Victor eventually. The next morning, Victor is lead on board Elena's ship to be imprisoned in Avalor Palace for his crimes.\n\nIn \"[[Sister of Invention]]\", an imprisoned Victor refuses to tell Elena anything, and expresses shock when she mentions the Delgado's cabin. Later, in \"[[To Save a Sunbird]]\", Carla is locked up in the same cell as him when she fails to rescue him. Though she believes she failed him, Victor assures her that it's the fact that they're together that's important. He is hopeful that Ash will soon rescue him and Carla, unaware that she is actually on her way to Takaina so she can obtain powerful magic.\n\nIn \"[[The Magic Within]]\", Victor is happy to be reunited with Ash once she is recaptured, but he is upset when she only hugs Carla and not him. Esteban arrives as Mateo told him what happened. Elena confirms this and adds all of Avalor's enemies are locked up. Victor retorts Esteban would be locked up too if that were true (obviously referring to what he told Elena before). Knowing what he's referring to, Elena tells Victor to save his breath as she doesn't believe him and leaves. Also knowing what he was referring to, Esteban comes over to rub it in. Victor tells him the truth always has a way of coming out. Esteabn tells him \"Yes, if only you did\" and leaves.\n\nUltimately, Esteban's secret is revealed just like how Victor said it will, and he is imprisoned in a cell near the one containing Victor and his family. Victor is uncertain Esteban's family will forgive him, but Esteban is confident they will. When this does not happen and Esteban is sentenced to banishment after the carnaval parade, he escapes from the dungeon by tricking Higgins into unknowingly giving him the key before distracting him. Following his escape, Esteban refuses to help the Delgados, but Ash reminds him that he needs them because he won't stand a chance against Elena and Mateo.\n\nOnce the Delgados and Esteban are all free from the dungeon, Esteban gives Carla and her parents back their tamboritas by sneaking into the treasury room and taking them. Victor makes an attempt to betray Esteban, but Ash and Esteban himself convince Victor they need him. The four of them escape the palace, but Elena, who found out about what happened and is now chasing them, panics and her magic unintentionally causes an avalanche that knocks Carla and Esteban off a cliff. Though Carla nearly falls to her death, Ash saves her but shows significantly less concern for her safety than Victor (who was unable to save Carla due to his tamborita being destroyed), while Esteban manages to climb back up. Victor refuses to go with Ash over fear for Carla's safety, resulting in her turning him into stone with a terrified look on his face, which leaves Carla heartbroken.\n\nAfter Ash and Esteban flee, Carla and a petrified Victor are captured by Mateo, Gabe, and other guards. When asked about what happened to Victor, Carla solemnly reveals what her mother did and states she thought she loved her and her father, but she was wrong. Carla begs Elena to save Victor, saying she'll do anything Elena asks. Though Elena expresses sympathy for Carla, she still has her placed back in the dungeon.\n\nIn \"[[Captain Mateo]]\", Victor's petrified body is shown being kept in the garden of Avalor Castle. When Elena expresses anger towards what Esteban did, she unintentionally causes Victor to fly in the air. As she calms down, Victor is safely lowered back to the ground.\n\nHe returns in \"[[The Lightning Warrior]]\", his petrified body is turned back to normal. Carla helps him recap what had happened. Victor and Carla helps cook for Elena and her friends. When they were trapped by a monster of the sea guarding [[Ixlan]], he uses the pepper to make the monster sneeze everyone out. This only succeed in sneezing him out. Later, he and his daughter worked together to get out of the monster's mouth. He and [[Carla Delgado|Carla]] later joins Elena's group to stop Ash in payback for her betrayal of their ''familia'' for her own dark intentions.\n\nIn \"[[Coronation Day]]\", Victor and Carla show up when Elena and her friends are about to go off and confront Ash's villainous group, declaring their intention to come along. Elena asks them if they are sure they want to, since [[Ash Delgado|Ash]] will be there, to which Carla reminds her they told her they would help her defend Avalor, and meant it. At this, Elena gives Victor a look of respect and touches Carla's shoulder, and all of them depart.\n\nDuring the battle against the villains, Ash blasts Elena, when suddenly she is confronted by Victor and Carla, who point their tamboritas at her. Though she barely acknowledges Victor's presence, Ash is shocked Carla would do such a thing, only for Carla to retort that she turned Victor into stone. Ash insists she loves Carla more than anyone or anything, but Victor tells her she loves herself more. Upon failing to convert Carla to her side, Ash dares her to give it her best shot, but Carla finds herself unable to blast Ash. Victor attempts to blast her anyway, but she dodges it and casts a spell that sends him relentlessly spinning as Carla chases after him. With her family out of the way, Ash is given the opportunity to release the [[Four Shades of Awesome|Shadows of the Night]], only to end up falling into the Spirit World with Elena and Flo. Shortly after the Shades' release, one of them, Yolo the Animal Shade, turns Victor and Carla into peabunnies. When Team Avalor retreats, Naomi picks up the transformed Victor and Carla.\n\nAfter Elena's forgiveness towards a now redeemed Esteban creates a wave that undoes all the damage the Shades have done to Avalor, Victor and Carla are returned to normal. They meet up with everyone at the castle courtyard, where Elena and Esteban return to Avalor after sealing Cahu the Time Shade in the Spirit World. Now that peace has been restored, he and Esteban are friends again and Elena proceeds with her coronation, with Victor and Carla being among the many attendants and bowing to Elena. They are also among the ones who give Naomi a smile of approval when Elena names her the new Chancellor, and quickly sing and dance with the others.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Victor slightly resembles his voice actor, [[Lou Diamond Phillips]].\n*Victor's actor, [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], also voiced [[Surak]] in Season 3 of [[The Lion Guard|\"The Lion Guard.\"]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nEp22RealmOfTheJaquins23.png\nEp22RealmOfTheJaquins60.jpg\nRoyal Rivalry 11.png|Victor and Carla still at large.\nRoyal Rivalry 12.png\nRoyal Rivalry 13.png\nThe two faces of Carla Delgado.png\nShuriki reveals herself to Elena.png\nShuriki, Fiero, Victor & Carla attack.png\nSong of the Sirenas 31.jpg\nSong of the Sirenas 33.jpg\nSong of the Sirenas 34.jpg\nSong of the Sirenas 38.jpg\nSong of the Sirenas 41.jpg\nCruz & Vestia fed up with Victor & Carla's abuse.png|Cruz and Vestia finally fed up with Victor and Carla's abuse.\nCruz & Vestia toss the Delgados off.png|The jaquins toss Victor and Carla into the snowy forest below.\nSnow Place Like Home 6.png\nSnow Place Like Home 8.png\nSnow Place Like Home 9.png\nDelgado family reunion.png\nVictor & Ash Delgado arguing.jpg\nVictor with the orb from Shuriki's scepter.jpg\nVictor & Ash plotting with Shuriki's Orb.jpg\nVictor & Ash embrace.jpg\nThree wizards have elena.jpeg\nVictorwithAsh(2).png\nVictor Delgado arrested.jpg|Victor gets arrested by Esteban and Joaquin.\nVictor petrified by Ash to Carla's horror.jpg|Victor turned to stone by Ash, to Carla's horror.\nTeam pose.png|Victor and Carla now on Team Avalor\nThe Delgados, Cruz and Vestia.jpg\nFile:Screen Shot 2021-07-24 at 23.30.28.png|Victor going against Ash together with Carla\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[pt-br:Victor Delgado]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Peacocks]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
