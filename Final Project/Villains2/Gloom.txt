He was going to have been grown bigger as he becomes more important.\n\nHe is presumably the dark wave after Anger put the light bulb in, and was destroyed after [[Sadness]] removed the light bulb. He is also probably the one who made Riley reject the chance of sliding down the stair railing.\n\nEarly concepts of him can be seen in ''[[The Art of Inside Out]]'' book.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nWIN 20160422 164948.JPG|Early Gloom concept with an early version of Riley\nWIN 20160422 165028.JPG|Another piece of concept art of Gloom\nWIN 20160422 165115.JPG|How Gloom would grow throughout the film\n</gallery>\n\n{{Inside Out}}\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Inside Out characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
