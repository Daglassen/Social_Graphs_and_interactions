The demon was too strong to defeat until the Ninja found the source of the Tengu's great power. The demon feathers infused the Ninja Suit with mysterious powers. Upon defeating the Tengu, the Ninja imprisoned it in a sacred stone. It can only be released by the hand of Ninja. The Tengu and the Ninja are forever linked, their strengths are shared.|Excerpt from the [[NinjaNomicon]]}}\n\nThe '''Tengu''' is an evil bird demon from the [[Disney XD]] show, ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''. It was imprisoned in the [[Eye of Eternity]] by the [[First Ninja]], and it keeps [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]] trapped under [[Norrisville High]].\n\n==Background==\nThe [[First Ninja]] did battle with the Tengu 800 years ago, but the creature proved to be too powerful to be defeated. Once the Ninja discovered the Tengu's feathers were the source of its powers, the Ninja infused the feathers into the [[Ninja Mask]]. Doing so granted the [[Ninja Suit]] unfathomable abilities, but also formed a link between the Tengu and the Ninja. The Tengu was imprisoned within a sacred stone called the Eye of Eternity. The Sorcerer tried to claim the stone, knowing it would make him unstoppable, but the Ninja used the stone to imprison the Sorcerer underground. Today, the stone resides in a mosaic in the lobby of [[Norrisville High]], and only the Ninja's hand can release the Tengu from its prison.\n\n==Abilities==\nThe Tengu is a powerful demon bird with mystical powers. It is capable of fighting its foes using its sharp talons and fanged beak or by using its wings as fists. It can also fire its feathers as projectiles. Being linked to the Ninja Suit the Tengu can go into the Ninja Rage mode with Randy as shown in \"[[Randy Cunningham: 13th Century Ninja]]\", while possessing Howard and being controlled by Randy. It\u2019s own feathers are it source to it great power and were woven into the Ninja Mask which allowed the wearer to gain a variety of mysteries powers and bestowed the wearer control over the Tengu.\n\n*'''Possession''': The Tengu is capable of possessing and gaining control of a human host, though the host still retains a number of their physical features. The time it takes for the Tengu to fully possess someone varies, from a few seconds to a couple of hours. However, the Tengu seems to desire control and usually possesses the most available and closest victim. When the creature possesses [[Howard Weinerman]], his eyes occasionally flash red, and he starts sprouting feathers. Over time, he starts behaving like a bird, flapping his arms and screeching like a bird of prey. He gets exhausted until the Tengu takes complete control over him, which causes him to fully transform into a monstrous bird creature.\n\n=== Weaknesses===\n*'''Link with the Ninja''': Since the Tengu shares a link with the Ninja, they possess the same strengths and weaknesses. This means that when the Ninja gets an injury, the Tengu receives that same injury as well. [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]] used this tactic to hurt himself in order for the Tengu to leave Howard's body.\n\n==Trivia ==\n*Tengus exist in Japanese folklore and are characterized by their avian and humanized features.\n*The mouth part of the mask can open up, reveling it's pointy tongue, implying that mask could actually be it's true face or perhaps the mask is fused to it's face.\n*The Eye of Eternity, the stone the Tengu is trapped in, was also the stone that the sunlight bounced off of that led Randy and Howard to the Sorcerer's Key in \"Randy Cunningham and the Sorcerer's Key\".\n**\u200bIn addition, the Eye of Eternity is what traps the Sorcerer underground, as revealed in \"[[Sorcerer in Love]]\".\n*In the center of the calendar in \"[[Randy Cunningham and the Sorcerer's Key]]\", the Tengu's face can be seen.\n*The Tengu is quite similar in design to Aku from ''Samurai Jack'.'''\n**It is also quite similar in design to Ho-Oh from ''Pokemon''.\n*The First Ninja is able to perform a Nameless Dragon Move similar to the Tengu Fireball yet it looks like a dragon and his suit doesn't change color. It is unknown if this power is also linked to the Tengu.\n*When The Tengu appeared fully to possess Howard a second time, Lightning and Thunder flashes can be seen. This likely due to the Tengu as according to Japanese folklore, Tengus have the ability to control weather.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTengu Unleashed.png|The Tengu released from its prison.\nTenguPossession.jpg|The Tengu possesses Howard.\nTenguRage.jpg\nEvilSpiritWeek - 424.png\nEvil Spirit Week - Tengu and Ninja.jpg\nEvilSpiritWeek - 602.jpg|Tengu Howard causing havoc.\nEvil Spirit Week 284.png\nNinja Tengu Link.png|Randy discovers the link shared between the Tengu and the Ninja...\nNinja Tengu Power Match.png|...as well as the fact that they share the same strengths.\nEvil Spirit Week - Poor Ninja.png\nTengu bird released.png|The Tengu leaves Howard's body.\nTengu Thunderstorm.png\nEvil Spirit Week 316.png\nEvil Spirit Week 334.png|The Tengu swoops down at its prey.\nEvil Spirit Week 359.png\nEye of Eternity.png|The [[Eye of Eternity]].\nTengu Eye.jpg\nTengu Unleashed Again.png\nRC13CN - 1196.jpg\nFile:Randy Cunningham 13th Century Ninja - Howard 00.jpg\nRC13CN - 1203.jpg\nRC13CN - 1255.jpg|Tengu Howard in Ninja Rage Mode\nFile:Randy Cunningham 13th Century Ninja - Fire.jpg\nThe Sorcerer vs Randy-Randy Cunningham-13th Century Ninja-In side the Nomicon.png\nTengu Design.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
