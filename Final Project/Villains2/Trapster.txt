The Trapster tried to trap Spider-Man in a sticky glue, while in the fight he putted a tracer on Spider-Man. Spider-Man then shot a web to the hole of the gun and exploded covering Trapster in glue. After [[Nick Fury]] arrived, Trapster tried to escape, but Fury shot a pole which hit Trapster and got knocked out. Trapster then was imprisoned.\n\nHis name was mentioned by the remaining Frightful Four members as they searched for Spider-Man in Midtown High school inside the cafeteria. He was also listed by Spider-Man as one of the villains he took down.\n\nHe escaped and battled against Spider-Man and his entire team, but was defeated and recaptured. He escaped again and tried to rob a bank, but was captured after his weapon was hit by [[Captain America's Shield]]. He later mistook Flash Thompson for Spider-Man and was defeated by the real one and put in jail once again. [[Doctor Octopus]] later helped him out of prison and he freed the other three before helping capture Spider-Man in a warehouse before they escaped.\n\n===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===\n[[Hawkeye]] is first contacted by [[Iron Man]] right after he stopped Trapster,\u00a0[[Ulysses Klaw|Klaw]], and [[Wizard (Marvel)|Wizard]] from committing a robbery.\n\n==Background in other media==\nThis is Peter Petruski's fifth animated appearance as the incarnation Trapster. Previous versions included are ''Fantastic Four (1978)'', ''Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes'', ''Fantastic Four (1994)'', and ''The Super Hero Squad Show''.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://thedailybugle.wikia.com/wiki/Trapster Trapster in the Ultimate Spider-Man wiki]\n{{USMWiki}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
