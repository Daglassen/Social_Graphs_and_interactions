She can be seen sitting to the north of [[Ember]] inside the Stable, mumbling to herself about the [[Royal Guard's Series]] of {{Plural|BotW|Weapon|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|The royal guard's series...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> When Link speaks to her, she will ask if he is planning to enter [[Hyrule Castle (Breath of the Wild)|Hyrule Castle]].<ref name=\"Royal Guard\">{{Cite|Have you gone to the giant castle north of here? That's Hyrule Castle. It's said to have fallen to ruin over a hundred years ago. I used to sneak in there to salvage ancient treasures, but it's too dangerous to go in there now. These days it's surrounded by an eerie mist and savage machine-like creatures. Back when it was safer, I went in looking for this ultra-rare equipment that once belonged to the {{Color|BotW Red|royal guard}}. It's legendary among collectors, but I was never able to find any...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> She then explains that she used to enter the Castle in search of the Royal Guard's Series.<ref name=\"Royal Guard\"/> She will offer Link advice for various ways to enter the Castle.<ref>{{Cite|Do you want me to give you some advice on getting into the castle?|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> If Link agrees, she will offer the \"[[Goron]]\", \"[[Rito]]\", and \"[[Zora]]\" style, alongside the option for another way.<ref>{{Cite|[Tell me...] The best way to get into Hyrule Castle is to employ the styles of the people of Hyrule, obviously.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|So what's your style? Goron? Rito? Zora? Or another way?|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks to hear the Goron way, she will explain that the Goron style is to recklessly charge in through the Castle's gates while equipped with [[Food]] that restores health and [[Stamina]].<ref>{{Cite|[Goron style!] Right, Goron style. Do this if you have faith in your willpower and strength. The way in is simple and clear. Storm the castle's front gates! The key here is to bring along food that will restore your health and stamina.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks to hear the Rito style, Parcy suggests that sailing in over the moat via the mountains north of the Castle is for him if he's comfortable flying.<ref>{{Cite|[Rito style!] Rito style? If you're comfortable sailing through the air, this method is for you. Just head east or west from these plains, and swing 'round up the mountain to the north of the castle. Then just fly down toward the castle from there, over the moat, and find a safe spot to land.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks to hear the Zora style, she notes the waterfalls feeding into the moat, and tells him that while it's difficult to swim through the waters, he can use the falls to make it into the Castle if he is a strong swimmer.<ref>{{Cite|[Zora style!] Ah, Zora style. If you're a strong swimmer who can swim up streams and waterfalls, this is a good option. There's a moat surrounding the castle. It's a little tough to swim through, but there are a few waterfalls still running. Just swim up one of those and you should be able to make it.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> Additionally, if Link asks for another way into the Castle, she will also offer the \"[[Gerudo]]\" and \"[[Sheikah]]\" styles of entry.<ref>{{Cite|[Another way!] Another way, huh?|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Gerudo? Sheikah? Or something else?|Parcy|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAsking to hear the Gerudo style results in Parcy counseling Link to bravely charge into the Castle on horseback, shooting [[Arrow]]s at the [[Guardian]]s' eyes to pass through without being harmed.<ref>{{Cite|[Gerudo style!] Gerudo style? If you have faith in your courage and technique, this is for you. There are machine-like monsters called Guardians lurking around the castle. Even if they target you with their lasers, don't back down. Just gallop past through the ruins of castle town! It won't be easy, but if you're confident in your archery skills, just aim for the Guardians' eyes. Hitting them in their eyes will stun them long enough for you to slip past unharmed.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks for the Sheikah style, Parcy will inform him that this style is her personal favorite, explaining that there are two ways to enter with this method.<ref name=\"Sheikah\">{{Cite|[Sheikah style!] Sheikah style, eh? This is the method I use. Observe from a distance, and then try to sneak in a back entrance where there aren't many monsters patrolling. \u0701I'll tell you about the two entrances I've found. The first one is called East Passage. To find it, cross Helmhead Bridge to the east of the castle, and with the castle on your left, climb up the hill. Look closely and you'll see an entrance to a tunnel in the middle of the castle. The luminous stones near the entrance sparkle at night, making it easy to find. The second entrance is the docks. From the island west of the castle, use the raft near the dock to sail to the north side. You'll find the docks there. Those are the only hidden entrances I know of.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> The first is to enter through the [[East Passage]], which leads into Hyrule Castle's [[Hyrule Castle (Breath of the Wild)#Library|Library]] and is marked by the [[Luminous Stone]]s at its entrance.<ref name=\"Sheikah\"/> The second is by way of entering through the [[Dock]]s, which also lead into the Library.<ref name=\"Sheikah\"/> If Link declares that he wishes to go about it his own way, she will joke that he should act like the hero 100 years prior and destroy all of the Guardians along his way.<ref>{{Cite|[My own way!] If you're so confident, you should do it like the legendary hero himself and just crush all the Guardians on your way in. ...Ah, just joking. Heh... I'm just messing with you. Only a fool would try that.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> If Link decides against hearing any of her advice, she will tell him that it is dangerous and that he should be prepared.<ref>{{Cite|[Nope, I'm good.] It's deathly dangerous near there so I can't recommend it, but if you're set on going, make sure you're prepared.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter speaking with Parcy, Link will be tasked with the [[Side Quest]], \"[[The Royal Guard's Gear]]\". If Link returns with an item from the Royal Guard\u2019s Series, Parcy will recognize it and ask to see it.<ref>{{Cite|Wait just a minute! Can you show me that bow you've got there?!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Wait just a minute! Can you show me that big sword you've got there?!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Wait just a minute! Can you show me that shield you've got there?!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Wait just a minute! Can you show me that spear you've got there?!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Wait just a minute! Can you show me that sword you've got there?!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> Upon looking it over, she will thank Link and reward him with a [[Gold Rupee]], completing her Quest.<ref>{{Cite|This is...incredible.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Thank you. You have shown me something truly spectacular. I need to go out and find one of these myself.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Here's a token of my appreciation.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> Upon returning to Parcy with an item from the Royal Guard's Series, she will ask for it,<ref>{{Cite|Hey, that bow...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Hey, that big sword...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Hey, that shield...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Hey, that spear...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Hey, that sword...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> offering a [[Topaz]],<ref>{{Cite|Will you trade it for a topaz?|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> [[Sapphire]] or a <ref>{{Cite|Will you trade it for a sapphire?|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> [[Ruby]] <ref>{{Cite|Will you trade it for a ruby?|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> \nin return. If Link declines her offer, she will be upset and wish she had something better to offer.<ref>{{Cite|I guess it wasn't meant to be... Wish I had something else to offer you.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> Accepting her offer will reward Link with the offered [[Gem]], with Parcy thanking him for the item.<ref>{{Cite|Really?! Thank you!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> After Link completes Parcy\u2019s Quest, she will continue to wonder if there are any more treasures in Hyrule Castle.<ref>{{Cite|I bet you there are still all kinds of treasures hidden away in Hyrule Castle that we don't even know about...|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> Link can continue bringing her items in the Royal Guard\u2019s Series in exchange for Gems.\n\nAt night, Parcy will fall asleep in one of the beds at the Stable. If Link wakes her, she will yell at him for his rude behavior.<ref>{{Cite|HEY! You've got some gall waking up a sleeping stranger! Show a little respect!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I'M SLEEPY! GO AWAY!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref> If Link wakes her while he is not wearing any [[Armor]] covering his torso, she will call him a creep.<ref>{{Cite|HEY! You've got some nerve waking up a sleeping stranger. And... WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?! GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU CREEP!|Parcy|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Here's some friendly advice\u2014don't wake up strangers when you're not wearing clothes, you little creep.|Parcy|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Names\n|align= left\n|enBr= \n|enBrM= \n|ja= {{Romanize|\u30d1\u30ea\u30c3\u30bb|Parisse}}\n|jaM= \n|zhS= \n|zhSM= \n|zhT= \n|zhTM= \n|nl= \n|nlM= \n|fi= \n|fiM= \n|frC= \n|frCM= \n|frF= \n|frFM= \n|de= \n|deM= \n|hu= \n|huM= \n|it= \n|itM= \n|ko= \n|koM= \n|no= \n|noM= \n|pl= \n|plM= \n|ptB= \n|ptBM= \n|ptP= \n|ptPM= \n|ru= \n|ruM= \n|esS= \n|esSM= \n|esL= \n|esLM= }}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[The Royal Guard's Gear]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
