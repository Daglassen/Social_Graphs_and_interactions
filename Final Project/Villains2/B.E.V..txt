She is the head of the Internet, an antivirus software. Despite serving a noble facility, B.E.V. is a cold-hearted figure with a fascist streak.<ref name=\"art\">{{Cite book|author=Julius, J., Johnston, P., & Moore, R.|date=2018|title=The Art of Ralph Breaks the Internet|publisher=Chronicle Books}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Development===\nEarly versions of ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' included a villainous character for Ralph and Vanellope to overcome; not unlike [[King Candy]] in ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''. B.E.V. was the overlord of the Internet, a powerful organization built to eradicate all viruses in the [[Internet]]. The character was modeled after co-director [[Phil Johnston]]'s mother and went through a number of iterations over the course of development.\n\nThe most notable iteration of B.E.V. was a manipulative villain that posed as a sweet, Midwestern lady. In another version, she was an antagonistic, yet well-meaning security official that sought to protect the Internet by any means necessary. In some versions, even B.E.V. was a militaristic male character with a cold and formal demeanor. Eventually, the filmmaking team opted to cut B.E.V. and the idea of a villain altogether in favor of a narrative in which Ralph's internal struggles served as the antagonist.<ref name=\"art\"/><ref name=\"villain\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.moviebill.com/stories/story-cache-how-ralph-breaks-the-internet-broke-its-narrative//|title=Story Cache: How 'Ralph Breaks the Internet' broke its narrative|date=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"vill\">{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/ralph-breaks-the-internet-had-a-few-totally-different-p-1829920568|title=Ralph Breaks the Internet Had a Few Totally Different Plots Before It Was Done|date=October 25, .2018}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' coincided with the development of a virtual reality experience based on the film. The team behind it, Void, needed a villain for the attraction. They approached [[Pamela Ribon]] and requested a villainous security system, to which Ribon responded by introducing them to B.E.V. Ribon passed over the news of B.E.V.'s involvement in the attraction to Phil Johnston and co-director [[Rich Moore]], who were delighted to know the character had been resurrected.<ref name=\"vr\">{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-wreck-it-ralph-vr-experience-combines-the-best-1830448742|title=The New Wreck-It Ralph VR Experience Combines the Best of Both Movies Into a Wacky, Wonderful Time |date=November 15 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Parks\"/>\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nB.E.V. serves as the main antagonist of the virtual-reality attraction Ralph Breaks VR. In the attraction, Ralph and Vanellope sneak guests into the Internet to enjoy some online games. Unsurprisingly, Ralph's wrecking causes problems. Ralph and the guests are detected as viruses, prompting B.E.V. to unleash her antivirus drones upon the heroes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBev sitting concept art.jpeg|Bev as female\nMale Bev concept art.jpeg|Bev as male\nBev yellow dress concept art.jpeg|Bev as female\nMale Bev concept art 2.jpeg|Bev as male\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Programs]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
