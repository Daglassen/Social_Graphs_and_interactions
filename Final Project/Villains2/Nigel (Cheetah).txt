He wants to collect money for him and his friends by making [[Duma]] to race against greyhounds, because of Mr. Patel's uncle. However, their plan was foiled by\u00a0[[Ted and Susan Johnson|Ted,\u00a0Susan]] and[[Ted and Susan Johnson|\u00a0]][[Morogo]], the protagonists and deuteragonist of the film.\n\n== History ==\nPatel offers to buy Duma, but Susan refuses. When they leave the store, Patel explains to Nigel that he has an uncle in India that races cheetahs against greyhounds, and he could become rich if he could do the same with Duma.\n\nMeanwhile, Patel and Nigel hire Abdullah to kidnap Duma. Patel explains that cheetahs are sprinters, not distance runners. He plans to make the race just long enough that the cheetah will run out of steam. Unlike all the other gamblers, he will bet on the dogs and make a fortune. The night before Ted and Susan are to leave Africa, the three men break into the house, steal Ted\u2019s whistle, and use it to lure Duma away.\n\nAfter a tearful goodbye with Morogo, the family stops at Patel\u2019s store to get gasoline. Patel sees the tears in Susan\u2019s eyes and asks if she is crying over losing her pet. Ted realizes Patel could not know about Duma\u2019s disappearance and then notices that Abdullah is wearing shoes made from old tires, just like the tracks they found around Duma\u2019s mother\u2019s corpse. Ted tries to convince his parents that Patel kidnapped Duma, but they insist the animal is out \u201cexploring.\u201d\n\nAcross the Great Rift, the children find Abdullah\u2019s camp protected by a high fence and tripwires. They wait for nightfall before sneaking in. Along with a stack of flyers advertising Duma\u2019s race against the greyhounds, they find cheetah skins drying on the walls. Hearing Duma\u2019s whimpers, they enter a barn and find her locked in a cage. Susan and Ted go into a cabin looking for something to break the lock and are jumped by Abdullah. Nigel and Patel arrive and the three men argue over what to do with them. Abdullah wants to kill them, but Nigel suggests they lock them in the cage until after the race. When the men drive away with Duma, Morogo comes out of hiding. Susan, who was watching the trio, gives him the combination to unlock the cage.\n\nPatel crows to Nigel that he has bet a fortune that Duma will lose. Duma takes an early lead in the race, but as the race progresses the greyhounds catch up, then pass the cat. Ted grabs a policeman\u2019s whistle and blows. Hearing the whistle, Duma gets a second wind and wins by five lengths. The parents arrive just as Duma attacks Abdullah, and Earl pulls the cheetah off him. As both sets of parents berate their children for being irresponsible, the police arrest the three kidnappers.\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Cheetah characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Poachers]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n\n[[Category:English characters]]"
