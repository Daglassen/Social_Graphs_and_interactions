They only appear in the episode \"[[Timon on the Range]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nJust like every bandit, the three men are tough and aggressive. When they mistake [[Pumbaa]] for [[Cisco Pig]], they seem to have soften up, but when they find out Pumbaa is not their leader, they pull their guns out to shoot him and [[Timon]].\n\n===Physical Description===\nCisco Pig's gang are tall, slender men who wear Old Western Clothes and have bandannas covering their faces except for their eyes.\n\n==Role in the series==\nCisco Pig and his gang are about to rob the train. Cisco Pig gets on the track to try to do so and on his last attempt, the train runs into him; making his gang think he's dead.\n\nWhile Timon and Pumbaa visit the Old West, the people mistake him for Cisco Pig. When the two get to a bank, the cashier gives them all his money. Then the three bandits show up for him to give them his money, but the cashier tells them that he gave them to Timon and Pumbaa.\n\nAfter the gang chase Timon and Pumbaa and catch them, they mistake Pumbaa for Cisco Pig and start pampering them and do some activities with them. Then when the gang tells the two to rob the train, Pumbaa tells them that it's illegal. After hearing his refusal, the gang becomes suspicious and they ask Pumbaa questions about Cisco Pig. The warthog answers every question right until they ask him if Cisco Pig likes him or Timon. After Pumbaa says that the warthog bandit just likes him, the gang find out that he's not their leader.\n\nCisco Pig's gang chase Timon and Pumbaa again. Timon and Pumbaa now get surrounded by the gang, who are about to shoot them. Cisco Pig shows up and stops them. The three men are now defeated.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTotr Gang2.png\nTotr Gang3.png\nTotr Gang4.png\nTotr Gang6.png\nTotr Gang7.png\nTotr Gang8.png\nTotr Gang9.png\nTotr Gang12.png\nTotr Gang13.png\n1st Gang.png|\"We thought you had kicked the bucket.\"\n2nd Gang.png|\"Had laid out cold.\"\n3rd Gang.png|\"Or pushing up daisies.\"\nTotr Gang15.png\nCisco Pig's Gang2.png\nCisco Pig's Gang3.png\nCisco Pig's Gang4.png\nTotr Gang16.png\nTotr Gang17.png\nTotr Gang18.png\nTotr Gang19.png|\"We don't dare criticize, Cisco but when are we going to end this redunity and get back to our bandido business of knocking over trains?\"\nCisco Pig's Gang5.png|\"You were supposed to rob the train.\"\nTotr Gang20.png\nTotr Gang22.png\nTotr Gang23.png\nTotr Gang24.png\nRabbitSeasonorDuckSeason.png|\"[[Wikipedia:Rabbit Fire|Rabbit season or duck season?]]\"\nTotr Gang26.png\nTotr Gang27.png\nTotr Gang28.png\nCisco Pig's Gang6.png\nTotr Gang30.png\nGang1.png|\"Cisco Pig?!\"\nTotr Gang31.png\nGang2.png|\"Cisco Pig?!\"\nTotr Gang32.png\nGang3.png|\"Cisco Pig?!\"\nTotr Gang33.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
