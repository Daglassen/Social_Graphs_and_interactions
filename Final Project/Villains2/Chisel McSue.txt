He also accused Scrooge of not being a true [[Scotland|Scot]]. Scrooge and his nephews managed to defeat him after staging a mock Battle of Culloden.\n\nIn the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[Down and Out in Duckburg]]\", a character named [[Fritter O'Way]] with the same background took over Scrooge's fortune until Scrooge recovered the cargo sunk with Seafoam's ship, the ''Golden Goose''.\n\nHis great-great-grandfather, Swindle McSue, is the man whose case of horseradish Seafoam McDuck agreed to transport in 1776. Because of that incident, Scrooge almost lost his fortune.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wikipedia}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McSue, Chisel}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
