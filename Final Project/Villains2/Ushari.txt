He also appears as the primary antagonist of \"[[The Rise of Scar]],\" and the secondary antagonist of season 2 up until [[Battle for the Pride Lands]], where he later serves as a posthumous antagonist for the remainder of the final season.\n\n==Role in the series==\n\n===''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]''===\nWhen [[Bunga]] and [[Kion]] are playing Baobab Ball, they run into Ushari, who falls into a heap with Bunga. The baobab fruit ends up in Ushari's mouth, but Bunga quickly grabs it away, and Ushari is forced to duck as Kion leaps over him after his friend.\n\n===''[[The Lion Guard]]''===\n\n====\"[[The Rise of Makuu]]\"====\nUshari attempts to eat a hyrax, but Bunga saves the tiny animal, tossing Ushari into a tree. Annoyed, the snake hisses Bunga's name in disgust.\n\n====\"[[Never Judge a Hyena by its Spots]]\"====\nWhile the [[Lion Guard]] (minus Kion) is looking for Flat Ridge Rock, they come across Ushari who was just awaken by Bunga.\n\n====\"[[Bunga the Wise (episode)|Bunga the Wise]]\"====\nWhile cleaning up after the rain storm Kion, [[Fuli]], and [[Beshte]] approach Ushari's hole when Kion asks who'll go in to see if he and his cobra family are stuck in the mud.\n\n====\"[[The Kupatana Celebration]]\"====\nUshari is seen next to [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] during the opening song before the celebration.\n\n====\"[[Fuli's New Family]]\"====\nWhile trying to calm down a herd of stampeding water buffalo, Bunga tries to pull one out of the mud but ends up flying into a bush where Ushari bites him for landing on his head then slithers away.\n\n====\"[[Paintings and Predictions]]\"====\nUshari is lying in the grass when Bunga jumps on him. He coils tightly around the honey badger and tells him that while he should bite him, the last time he did he was unable to rid his mouth of Bunga's taste for days. Ushari then uncoils and slithers away.\n\n====\"[[The Lost Gorillas]]\"====\nUshari is resting near the Lion Guard when a gorilla called [[Majinuni and Hafifu|Hafifu]] calls his brother, Majinuni, and mistakenly refers to Ushari as a stick. Ushari is mildly offended by their statement, but before he can do anything, Hafifu grabs him from the floor while Majinuni taunts him by saying he can't hit the baobab fruit. Hafifu assures him that he can and ignores Ushari's cries for him to stop, and throws Ushari into the fruit hanging on a tree. Ushari bites down with his fangs but falls regardless. When he reaches the floor he spits the fruit out, muttering \"Every time I get near the Lion Guard\".\n\n====\"[[The Rise of Scar]]\"====\nUshari appears in this film as the main antagonist up until the end of the film. It's the beginning of the dry season and Ushari is going on his way, when the Lion Guard runs him over. Tired of having not getting respect, Ushari decides to change that. Upon hearing Kion talking with [[Makini]] on how he can speak to [[Mufasa]], Ushari decides to use it as an opportunity to take charge. Once in [[the Outlands]], he encounters [[Janja]] and [[Janja's Clan|his clan]] and tells them how Kion is able to speak to Mufasa and if they want to stop the Guard they should also find a way to talk to one of the Great Lions of the Past. Though Janja exclaims that no Great Lion would help the hyenas but Ushari reminds Janja of how Scar helped the hyenas (yet is unaware of, or does not mention Scar's death by the claws of the hyenas) and how if Kion can talk to Mufasa then they might be able to speak Scar.\n\nSo Ushari returns to the [[Pride Lands]] where he confronts Makini and tricks her into asking [[Rafiki]] about if there's a way to speak to the bad lions of the past. Ushari then summons his Skink friends to spy on Makini and reveal what Rafiki tells her about Scar. After finding the hidden entrance they find Ushari and he sneaks inside without the Guard knowing he's spying on them, he soon hears that the bad lions appear in fire unleashed by the [[Roar of the Elders]] using the Bakora staff. After hearing this Ushari returns to the Outlands and tells the hyenas. They soon come up with a plan to kidnap [[Kiara]] and hold her prisoner in order for Kion to use his roar in anger. While the hyenas grab Kiara Ushari awaits at the top of the volcano for the staff, once both the staff and Kiara are in their possession all they need is for Kion to roar in anger. After Kiara is saved, Janja tells Kion that next time they might get rid of her or his family and friends. This enrages Kion, who uses the roar in anger and Ushari uses the staff to summon Scar as the volcano erupts. At first, it doesn't work like they hoped, and afterwards Janja confronts Ushari and kicks the staff into the volcano, causing Scar's spirit appear, much to Janja's fright.\n\n====\"[[Let Sleeping Crocs Lie]]\"====\nAfter the skinks see that [[Makuu's Float|Makuu's float]] is awake during the Dry Season, they inform Ushari who then tells Scar and thinks it could lead to the end of [[Simba]]'s reign. Later after the skinks inform the two of them that [[Kiburi]] has challenged Makuu to a Mashindano Scar tells Ushari to trick Kiburi into taking down Simba so he can rule the Pride Lands and he does so. After Kiburi loses the Mashindano he and his three followers are banished to the Outlands where they find Ushari sleeping on a rock and confront him with anger. It is there he takes the four of them to the hyena's volcano Scar reveals himself and they are made members of his faction in a plan to unite all the outlanders and take over the Pride Lands.\n\n====\"[[Swept Away]]\"====\nUshari is resting in the volcano, but can't because the hyenas are arguing. When all of a sudden the skinks arrive and inform them that Beshte is lost in the Outlands, Scar sees it as an opportunity to get rid of him which Ushari agrees to. After the pain fails Ushari appears and tells Janja, [[Cheezi]] and [[Chungu]] that Scar wants to see them and he's not happy.\n\n====\"[[Rescue in the Outlands]]\"====\nUshari is awoken by the hyenas and states \"Need I ask how the meeting with [[Reirei's Pack|the jackals]] went?\". Janja exclaims they didn't find them, instead they ran into [[Jasiri]] and how she kicked their butts.\n\n====\"[[The Bite of Kenge]]\"====\nAfter Scar orders the hyenas to go and steal all the elephants melon supply, but they were just stopped by the Lion Guard Ushari tells them about his monitor lizard friend [[Kenge]] and how he can help stop the Lion Guard and Scar tells him to go an ask Kenge for his assist.\n\n====\"[[The Scorpion's Sting]]\"====\nOn the day of the Kumbuka celebration, Ushari and the other [[Outlanders]] appear before Scar with a plan to kill Simba with the aid of a scorpion named [[Sumu]]. After Sumu poisons the king, Makini and the guard head to the Outlands to get volcano ash for Simba's aliment where they run into Scar for the first time. As Ushari and the the rest of the Outlanders move in to finish off the Lion Guard Kion uses the Roar at them and they manage to get the ash to Simba and save his life.\n\n====\"[[Undercover Kinyonga]]\"====\nWhen Scar summoned Janja to execute his newly planned operation, Ushari informed Janja that he is late and Ushari would have sent the Skinks to search for him if he didn\u2019t come. They started bickering each other which was quickly broken up by Scar.\n\n====\"[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]\"====\nScar has another plan to defeat the Lion Guard and the royal family. He tells Ushari [[When I Led the Guard|how he got his scar]]. When Scar was leader of the Lion Guard he patrolled by himself. While patrolling he met a [[strange Lion]] who knew that Scar had the Roar. He says that the whole who has the roar should be king since they have all the power. Scar then meets a [[strange Cobra]] who attacks him which gives him a scar. Then, Scar tells Ushari that he will be part of his plan. Ushari reacts with excitement when he hears it.\n\nWhen the Lion Guard comes into the volcano to stop Scar, Ushari attacks Kion on Scar's command, giving Kion a scar just like his evil great uncle. When Kion's scar starts to bother him, Ushari says his bite is venomous. Despite this, Kion uses a soft roar to defeat Scar once and for all; the kings of the past summoning rain to banish the evil spirit away. In an attempt to avenge Scar's demise, Ushari goes after Kion again but Bunga stops him just in time, causing them both to fall towards the lava pool. Luckily, [[Ono]] manages to save Bunga but not Ushari, who falls to his death into the lava below.\n\nDespite his demise, Ushari's venom has left a negative effect on Kion, who becomes under threat of being driven insane by the poison. This is what drives the Lion Guard to leave the Pride Lands to go to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]], where Kion can be cured of Ushari's venom.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friends and Allies===\n====[[Scar]]====\nUshari dislikes the Lion Guard so much that he vows vengeance on them for getting him run over whenever they are near. Ushari gets Janja and his hyenas to help him revive Scar as a spirit, so that they can get advice from him and defeat the Lion Guard once and for all. When Scar is revived when Janja throws Makini's staff into the volcano, Ushari is pleased to see him. A few years later shortly before Kion defeats him, Ushari bites Kion's left eye under Scar's orders. When Kion destroys Scar, he attempts to kill Kion, but is killed by Bunga instead, showing how much his hatred of the Lion Guard has destroyed him.\n\n====[[Kiburi]]====\n[[File:Let-sleeping-crocs-lie (262).png|thumb|250px|Ushari teams up with Kiburi to take down Simba.]]\nKiburi likes Ushari because of his sharp intellect. Even when Kiburi threatened to eat him after being exiled from the Pride Lands, Ushari convinces him to meet Scar. Ushari along with the rest of the Army of Scar attempt to kill Kion and his friends before they can cure Simba from a scorpion sting, but Ushari, [[Kiburi's Float|Kiburi's float]] of crocodiles, and the rest of the Outlander reptiles are defeated at the same time. Presumably, Kiburi's alliance with Ushari ended after he and Scar both perish in the volcano, and Jasiri takes over the Outlands in the aftermath of the war.\n\n====[[Shupavu]]====\nUshari refers to Shupavu and her group of skinks as his friends. Besides Scar, Ushari is the only creature that Shupavu will listen to. They both believe in reptile supremacy and hoped that Scar would rule the Pride Lands. They also listened to the story of [[When I Led the Guard|how Scar got his scar]]. This is the last time they are seen together before Kion defeats Shupavu and Ushari meets his fate in the flames below. It's likely that Shupavu and the other skinks dispersed after Ushari's passing.\n\n===Acquaitances===\n\n====[[Reirei]]====\nUshari and Reirei along with Kiburi, Janja, and [[Mzingo]] listen to Scar's plan about sending a scorpion to sting Simba. Whereas Reirei and Janja seem confused, Ushari understands that Sumu's venom is reserved to kill Simba, so that Scar can take over the Pride Lands. Ushari and the Reirei work together to kill Kion and his friends before they can cure Simba from the scorpion sting. Reirei has likely abandoned her alliance with Ushari after Scar is defeated.\n\n==== [[Timon]] & [[Pumbaa]] ====\nIn ''[[The Kupatana Celebration]]'' the Kupatana since Ushari watching for performing at \"[[Our Kupatana Community]]\" he's smiling at Timon and Pumbaa. They're probably friends and they know each other for some time. Ushari would not close to someone he doesn't know. Their friendship might have ended when Ushari turns evil, and even more so after he is killed by their adoptive son, Bunga.\n\n===Enemies===\n====[[Bunga]]====\n[[File:Ushari_and_Bunga_rained_on.png|thumb|240px|Ushari being pinned by Bunga shortly before his death]]Ushari hates Bunga more than any other member of Kion's Lion Guard because the honey badger frequently attacked or mocked the snake, usually for no legitimate reason. After he bites Kion's left eye, Bunga attacks him and pins him onto the ground until Scar is defeated. When Ushari attempts to kill Kion, Bunga intercepts the attack. While Ono manages to rescue Bunga from the cobra, Ushari falls to his dark death.\n\n====[[Kion]]====\n[[File:Ushari attacks Kion.png|Ushari bites Kion|thumb|250px]]\nUshari likely hates Kion because he is the best friend of his archenemy, Bunga. Even though Kion tried to reason with him, Ushari did not take his reasoning seriously, and he is shown to have some disrespect for him simply because of him being leader of the Lion Guard. Ushari eventually turns against Kion and helps Janja's clan summon the ghost of Scar. Shortly before Kion defeats Scar, Ushari bites him, inflicting venom within his scars as an attempt to corrupt Kion into using the Roar. Unfortunately, Kion ends up summoning the elders to judge and destroy Scar rather than destroying him himself. Outraged at Kion's victory, Ushari charges for the kill, but ends up falling into the lava pit where he is destroyed.\n\n====[[Makini]]====\nUshari successfully tricked Makini into asking Rafiki about how to summon the evil lions of the past, so that he could get the information needed to revive Scar. After Scar is revived, Ushari attempts to kill Makini and the Lion Guard before they can save Simba. Through Kion's roar they escape and save Simba's life.\n\n====[[Janja]]'s [[Janja's Clan|clan]]====\nUshari likely knew about the hyenas before their alliance with him, however when they ambush him in the Outlands, he shows great fear of them. Using his information about Kion's ability to speak with Mufasa, Ushari uses this to get on the hyenas' good graces by providing them a way to talk to Scar. As the plan unfolds, Janja frequently threatens Ushari's life, which only pushes the cobra to go further to make sure the plot succeeds, and in the end, Scar returns. After Scar's return to the Pride Lands, Ushari becomes the second-in-command within Scar's cult now intimidating the hyenas and condescending upon them as does Scar. Years within the battle with the Lion Guard, Ushari turns against Janja after hearing about his intentions of defecting to Jasiri's side, but later finds out that Janja's information on how to defeat Scar was only a lie that Scar fed to him to lure Kion to the volcano so that the Roar can destroy the Lion Guard.\n\n====[[Jasiri]]====\nUshari could not believe it when Janja mentioned to Ushari that she defeated Janja, Cheezi, and Chungu at the same time and Ushari wants for the hyenas to get rid of her because she is on the Lion Guard's side. Ushari also grows upset when he learns that Janja is considering joining Jasiri, knowing fully well that she is a good hyena and like [[Zira]], Ushari does not tolerate any form of betrayal against Scar.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ushari is the first and only character in the series to turn evil.\n*Ushari is the second cobra to appear in [[The Lion King (franchise)|''The Lion King'' franchise]], the second being [[the Cobra]] that appeared in the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' episode \"[[Once Upon a Timon]]\". Ironically, in both works, they are killed, and by lava.\n*With his hood closed, Ushari closely resembles a {{WikipediaLink|red spitting cobra}} except for the \"eye\" markings on his hood when extended, (a trait the species lacks).\n*Ushari means \"aggression\" in Swahili.\n*According to Ono, Ushari is an Egyptian cobra (the kind of cobra that killed Cleopatra VII, the Queen of Egypt who was the last Egyptian pharaoh).\n*He is one of the few guest characters who has a major role in ''The Lion Guard'' (he is a major antagonist of Season 2). The others are [[Scar]], [[Makuu]], and [[Makini]] (Makuu was a major antagonist of Season 1, Scar is the main antagonist of Season 2, and Makini is a major character in Season 2).\n*Starting with \"[[The Morning Report (episode)|The Morning Report]]\", Ushari has begun to have a hiatus on the Lion Guard before returning in the episode he died.\n*Excluding Scar who originated in the original ''Lion King'' film since he was already dead during the events of ''The Lion Guard'', Ushari is the first character to explicitly die in ''The Lion Guard''. This also makes him the first character to explicitly die in a [[Disney Junior]] show.\n*Ushari's role in Season 2, being the snake sidekick to Scar, is derived from early concepts of ''The Lion King'' in which Scar would've had a snake (albeit a python rather than a cobra) as a comic relief sidekick.\n*Despite not being involved with them, Ushari was indirectly responsible for the formation of [[Makucha's Army]] as well as the Lion Guard's journey to the Tree of Life where Kion fell in love with [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] and ultimately married her.\n*Unlike the other followers of Scar, Ushari is the only one to live in the Outlands by choice, rather than being banished by Simba or the Lion Guard.\n*Somehow, Ushari already knew who Jasiri was in Rescue in the Outlands.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBungaandUshari.png|Bunga tangled with Ushari\nUshariwindedup.png|A winded Ushari\nKionleapingoverUshari.png|Kion leaps over Ushari\nUshariandsnack.png|Ushari prepares to eat\nUshariandhyrax.png|Ushari eyes the hyrax\nUsharislitheringaway.png|Ushari with the hyrax in his mouth\nUsharimouthfull.png|Ushari with his mouth full\nUshariandBunga.png|\"That was my Lunch!\"\nUsharirolledup.png|Bunga rolls up Ushari\nUshariglaring.png|\"Ugh.
