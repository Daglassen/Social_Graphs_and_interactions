He launches it at Finn McMissile, but Finn launches a missile at that one, and they take out each other. He uses it that one time in the film.\n*'''Deployable Machine Gun''': Located on the opposite side of the missile launcher. In an attempt to get Lightning McQueen and Mater in London, he and Acer got out their weapons revealing Grem has a machine gun on his left side.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cars 2]]''===\nGrem is a dented, rusty orange AMC Gremlin. After years of being dismissed for his design, even rudely being called a \"lemon\", Grem has a big chip on his fender that has led him to the underworld of international espionage. As a henchman for his villainous boss, [[Professor Z]], Grem and his partner-in-crime [[Acer]] are trying to sabotage the [[World Grand Prix]] and the famous race cars competing in it. When Grem and Acer mistake [[Mater]] for an American agent with important top-secret information, the ruthless lemons set out on a global chase to stop Mater from foiling their evil scheme.\n\nHe is at the oil rig in the beginning of the film. Later in [[Tokyo]], he and Acer find the American spy named [[Rod \"Torque\" Redline]]. And together, they damage him pretty badly. He takes the spy back to Professor Z, and stands by watching as the spy explodes after putting Allinol in him and using their weapon to kill him. Later, Grem and Acer chase Mater and [[Finn McMissile]] at the airport. They are also seen present at the lemon meeting. Grem and Acer are also the ones who use the weapon during all the races. During the last race, they tease Mater for not being able to save [[Lightning McQueen]] as they fire the weapon at him. But fortunately, it doesn't work. He got beaten up by a bunch of British cars at \"[[London|Ye Left Turn Inn]]\" after he and Acer crash into each other at the end. It is unknown what happened to them afterward.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Grem is modeled on a [[1974]] AMC Gremlin.\n*His license plate reads WREKD, short for \"wrecked\". It is the same of Tyler Gremlin's.\n*On his Disney Store die-cast model, Grem is simply named \"Gremlin\", implying that it's possible he had a simpler name in concept.\n*Grem's tires say \"Rolling Stop\".\n*There is a costume of him on [[The World of Cars Online]], which you can get from [[Ramone's House of Body Art]].\n*In the ''Cars 2'' magazine with the 56-page ''Cars 2'' Movie Comic, when [[Holley Shiftwell|Holley]] stops him and Acer from getting Lightning and Mater, instead of ending up in \"Ye Left Turn Inn\", they landed in a garbage truck.\n*Grem, along with Acer, Professor Z, [[Miles Axlerod]] and Victor Hugo, are playable in ''[[Cars 2: The Video Game]]'', even though they are villains. However, it could be that they are part of the simulation.\n* Grem's [[LEGO]] depicts him in red livery.\u00a0For some reason, it shows him with brown eyes instead of green eyes like in his other appearances.\n**His second LEGO was revised in orange livery in the Oil Rig Escape set.\n*Grem's name originates from the first four letters of the word \"Gremlin\".\n*His Polish name is Al Scarpetta. In Polish \"skarpeta\" means \"sock\".\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|pixar|Grem|Pixar Wiki}}\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/worldofcarsdrivein/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|worldofcarsdrivein|Grem|World of Cars Wiki}}\n\n{{PixarWiki}}\n{{Cars}}\n\n[[es:Grem]]\n[[fi:Grem]]\n[[pt-br:Grem]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Cars characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]"
