As part of a demonstration, Duke Igthorn and [[Toadwart]] switch minds and bodies, and back again; much to Igthorn's delight, joy, and excitement.\n\nDuke Igthorn pays Malsinger, who takes the precaution of checking whether the money coins are fake or not. Satisfied with results, Malsinger transforms himself into an eagle and flies out of Drekmore Castle, and is never seen throughout the rest of the series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=150 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nMalsinger2.jpg\nMalsinger3.jpg\nMalsinger4.jpg|\"Ah, that's more like it.\"\nMalsinger5.jpg|\"Aye.\"\nMalsinger6.jpg|\"This be what you need...\"\nMalsinger7.jpg|\"...
