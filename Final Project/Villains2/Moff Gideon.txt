Following the Galactic Civil War he was thought to have been executed for committing a number of war crimes, but was found to have faked his own death and secretly built a small Imperial army after its downfall. Shortly after the war, Gideon stole the legendary Mandalorian lightsaber known as the Darksaber from its rightful owner, [[Bo-Katan Kryze]], and oversaw the Great Purge, an Imperial attack on Mandalore that rendered the planet uninhabitable and led to the death of nearly all of its inhabitants. \n\n===Personality===\nMoff Gideon was cold, calculating, and brutal where he executed one of his men for unintentionally interrupting him. Gideon was also extremely intelligent where he was able to figure what moves his enemies would make before or after confronting them. Gideon also took the habit of studying the background of his enemies before getting to meet them in person.\n\n==Role in the series==\nAfter the destruction of the second Death Star, Gideon eventually began to take part in the Imperial remnants\u2019 attempts to create clones that could be engineered to have Force powers. To achieve this end, he sought to obtain the Force-sensitive infant known as Grogu so that he could use the child\u2019s blood, which had an extremely high concentration of midichlorians (the microscopic bacteria that give individuals the ability to use the Force). \n\nGideon demanded Grogu to be brought back alive and ordered cloning scientist Dr. Pershing and an ex-Imperial warlord known only as The Client to place a bounty on him. The bounty was collected on by Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, but the Mandalorian had a change of heart and took Grogu back, acting has his father.  \n\nThis turn of events angered Gideon, who started overseeing the development of a third generation of Dark Troopers, which began as a heavy stormtrooper suit until the human was removed entirely. When Djarin eventually returned to his home planet of Nevarro to free it from Gideon\u2019s remnant\u2019s occupation, Gideon became personally involved.   \n\n=== Season 1 ===\nDjarin and his allies Cara Dune and Greef Karga attempt to kill the Client by pretending to bring Grogu back to him. Gideon, realizing this is a trap, orders his Death Troopers to shoot through the window in an effort to kill them all, but they only manage to kill the Client and his stormtroopers. Gideon then arrives and threatens Djarin, knowing that Djarin\u2019s friend Kuiil actually has Grogu. After his scout troopers kill Kuiil and kidnap Grogu, the heroes\u2019 ally IG-11 takes the child back and regroups with the others, starting a large fight between the ragtag group and Gideon\u2019s army. They manage to escape through the sewers after Gideon causes an explosion that injures Djarin, but after emerging from the sewers they are ambushed by Gideon in his TIE fighter. Djarin jumps onto the side of the fighter and manages to disable it, causing it to crash with Gideon still inside. Believing Gideon to be dead, the group goes their separate ways, with Djarin resolving to return Grogu to the Jedi. Unknown to all of them, Gideon survives and cuts himself out of the wreckage with the Darksaber.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nMuch later on Trask, Djarin helps Bo-Katan and her crew hijack an Imperial freighter. The captain tells Gideon that the cruiser has been compromised, so Gideon orders the captain to kill the crew and crash the ship to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Bo-Katan interrogates the captain for Gideon\u2019s location, but he kills himself to avoid Gideon\u2019s wrath. Bo tells Djarin to seek out her old Jedi friend Ahsoka Tano on Corvus and takes the ship to start building an army to retake Mandalore.\n\nAfter briefly returning to Nevarro for repairs to his ship, Djarin helps Karga and Dune destroy the planet\u2019s last Imperial base. Inside, they find several dead clone bodies in tubes and a hologram message from Dr. Pershing to Gideon. Pershing\u2019s message states that Grogu\u2019s blood is rich with midichlorians and he needs access to it again to create Force-sensitive clones. Realizing that Gideon is alive, Djarin, Dune, and Karga destroy the base and Djarin leaves to continue his search for Ahsoka. Unknown to Djarin and Karga, one of Karga\u2019s mechanics who repaired Djarin\u2019s ship is a spy for Gideon. He contacts Gideon\u2019s ship and tells the crew that he has installed a tracker on the ''Razor Crest.'' The captain informs Gideon, who prepares his Dark Troopers for combat.\n\nGideon tracks Djarin and Grogu to the planet Tython and sends a regiment of stormtroopers to capture Grogu. Djarin and his allies Boba Fett and Fennec Shand hold off the stormtroopers, and Fett destroys their transports as they retreat. In retaliation, Gideon destroys the ''Razor Crest'' from orbit, leaving nothing behind except the beskar spear that Djarin received from Ahsoka, and sends the Dark Troopers to kidnap the child. Aboard Gideon\u2019s cruiser, he enters Grogu\u2019s prison cell and finds him torturing two stormtroopers. He shows Grogu the Darksaber, telling him he is not ready for a lightsaber, before having his stormtroopers stun Grogu unconscious and handcuff him.\n\nDin finds Gideon\u2019s coordinates with the help of ex-Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld. He then sends a message to Gideon, turning Gideon\u2019s previous threat back at him word-for-word.\n\nAfter hijacking Dr. Pershing\u2019s shuttle, Djarin assembles a rescue team consisting of Boba Fett, Cara, Fennec, Bo-Katan, and Bo\u2019s partner Koska Reeves. Pershing agrees to give them the intel they need to board Gideon\u2019s cruiser, and Djarin splits up from the rest of the group to find Grogu. He finds Gideon in Grogu\u2019s cell, and Gideon claims that he only wanted to study Grogu\u2019s blood. He agrees to let Djarin take the baby and leave, but this is a trap and he tries to kill Djarin when his back is turned. This leads to a tense lightsaber duel which ends with Djarin disarming and capturing Gideon. Both Gideon and Bo-Katan tell him that this makes him the Darksaber\u2019s rightful owner. Djarin attempts to surrender the weapon to Bo-Katan, as the plan was for her to kill Gideon and take the Darksaber. However, Gideon and Bo explain that the weapon must be won in a duel. \n\nThe discussion is interrupted when the Dark Troopers head to the ship\u2019s bridge. Gideon hides a pistol under his cape while the heroes are distracted and the Dark Troopers attempt to punch through the doors. The ship is then boarded by an X-Wing, the pilot of which is a Jedi who fights all of the Dark Troopers on his own. Gideon, absolutely terrified, knows the Jedi could only be [[Luke Skywalker]]. In a last-ditch effort to claim victory, Gideon pulls out the pistol and shoots Bo-Katan, but she survives with only light wounds. He then tries to kill Grogu, but Djarin blocks the shots, which do nothing to him. \n\nDefeated, Gideon points the gun to his head and tries to commit suicide, but Cara stops him and knocks him unconscious. After the skirmish, he is taken prisoner by the New Republic.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\n4k-mandalorians01e07-starwarsscreencaps.com-5412.jpg|Moff Gideon speaking to the Client before killing him.\n4k-mandalorians01e07-starwarsscreencaps.com-5940.jpg\n4k-mandalorians01e07-starwarsscreencaps.com-5979.jpg\n4k-mandalorians01e07-starwarsscreencaps.com-6088.jpg\nMoff Gideon (You are my).jpg\n4k-mandalorians01e08-starwarsscreencaps.com-7733.jpg\n4k-mandalorians01e08-starwarsscreencaps.com-7774.jpg|Gideon with the Darksaber.\nThe Mandalorian - 2x06 - Chapter 14 The Tragedy - Moff Gideon.jpg\nThe Mandalorian - 2x07 - Chapter 15 The Believer - Moff Gideon.jpg\nMoff Gideon needs his enemies (S1E8).jpg\nMoff Gideon POP.jpg\nEmojiBlitzMoffGideon.png|Moff Gideon's emoji for ''[[Disney Emoji Blitz]]''.\nMoffGideonMandoAndBabyYodaThumbnailEmojiBlitz.jpeg|Moff Gideon on the Food Fight app icon.\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Moff Gideon}}\n*{{SW|url=/databank/moff-gideon|text=Moff Gideon}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Mandalorian characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic characters]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]"
