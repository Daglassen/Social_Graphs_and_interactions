Both of them are known to be rude and think they are better than everyone.\n\nThey arrived at [[Royal Preparatory Academy|Royal Prep]] a day early to practice on the course and when they met [[Prince Hugo|Hugo]] and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], they both proclaimed they would win again. Offended and annoyed, Hugo challenged Vaughan to a race to the water fountain and back which Vaughan wins due to superior speed and skill.\n\nThe next day, Sofia and Hugo fail to show up which the two squires make rude comments about. When the pair finally arrive, Vaughan and Vance show jealousy for their budding friendship. The race begins and, despite Sofia's great moves, the Squire team manages to stay ahead of the Royal team. After clearing the last hurdle, however, the Royal Prep team pulls out their trump card: the Flying Slingshot, which Hugo executes in a way that successfully puts Sofia in the lead and enables her to cross the finish line, winning the [[Flying Crown]] for Royal Prep for the first time in 100 years. After the race, Vaughan and Vance were very surprised that they were outpaced by a little girl and wondered how their opponents beat them.\u00a0\n\nVaughan and Vance make a second though nonspeaking appearance in \"[[Camp Wilderwood]]\". They both were attending the Junior Knights Summer Camp. They built a wooden submarine to compete in the intercamp island race. They almost won only to be defeated by James and Wendell, who had previously taken their camp's flag to use as a sail and raised it first.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe-Flying-Crown-25.png|Vaughan and Vance meeting Sofia and Hugo\nThe-Flying-Crown-26.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
