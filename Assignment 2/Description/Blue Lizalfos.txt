While their movement is bound to the beat of the music, they typically stand still until either {{Term|CoH|Cadence|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Link|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Yves|link}}, or {{Term|CoH|Princess Zelda|link}} crosses their path. Once they have the heroes within their sights, they will proceed to charge at them within a straight line, moving on every beat until they collide into something or the heroes stop their attack with their {{Term|CoH|Weapon|link}}, stunning them for three beats. While stunned, they are rendered completely defenseless until they regain consciousness on the fourth beat, returning to their original stance to look for targets.\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Stub|HWAoC}}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:CoH Blue Lizalfos Artwork.png|Blue Lizalfos artwork from {{CoH|-}}\nFile:CoH Blue Lizalfos Sprite.png|Blue Lizalfos from {{CoH|-}}\nFile:BotW Moblin and Lizalfos Concept Artwork.jpg|Concept art of Blue Lizalfos and other monsters from {{BotW|-}}\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Lizalfos]]\n* [[Black Lizalfos]]\n* [[Golden Lizalfos]]\n* [[Silver Lizalfos]]\n* [[Electric Lizalfos]]\n* [[Fire-Breath Lizalfos]]\n* [[Ice-Breath Lizalfos]]\n* [[Cursed Lizalfos]]\n* [[Stalizalfos]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Lizalfos\n |enemies= BotW, CoH, HWAoC\n}}"
