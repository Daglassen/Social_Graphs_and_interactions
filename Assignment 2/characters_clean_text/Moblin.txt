Moblins are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series. They are among the most common enemies throughout the series, having appeared in the majority of games, and are prolific in Ganon's army. Early in the series, Moblins originally resembled anthropomorphic bulldogs, but beginning in A Link to the Past, have increasingly acquired more pig- and goblin-like features. In all of their appearances, Moblins are characteristically depicted as using spears or javelins as their main weapon. They are abundant in forests but also occasionally appear inside mountains and dungeons.
In the 2D Zelda games, Moblins are often depicted as common foot soldiers encountered early in the game. In the 3D console Zelda games, Moblins are instead depicted as elite enemies capable of performing powerful attacks who may engage in full combat with Link. These Moblins usually require more careful or precise attacks to defeat.
While Moblins have changed little aside from their visual appearance throughout the series, some variants of the standard Moblin have also appeared. These include the Club Moblin, exclusive to Ocarina of Time; the Spear and Bow Moblins, which specialize in spears and Bows, respectively; and the Shield Moblin, which carry large Shields. In Link's Awakening, Oracle of Seasons, and Oracle of Ages, both bulldog- and pig-like Moblins appear. To differentiate between the two, the pig-like Moblins in those games are known as Boarblins. The King Moblin and Great Moblin are two notable Moblins that have appeared in the series. Other related species with similar names include the Bokoblin, Miniblin, Bulblin and Big Blin.

=== The Legend of Zelda ===
Main article: Red Moblin

In The Legend of Zelda, Moblins are common enemies found throughout Hyrule. They keep to the wooded areas, such as the Lost Woods, and throw spears to attack. These spears can be blocked with the most basic Shield. Like most enemies in this game, they come in two colors - red and blue; the blue being the stronger of the two, and able to withstand more hits from attacks. When defeated, red Moblins may drop either a Heart, a Fairy or one Rupee, while blue Moblins may drop either a Heart, one Rupee, four Bombs or a Clock.
Not all Moblins are enemies, however. Some friendly Moblins hide in secret Caves across Hyrule and give Link Rupees when spoken to, uttering the iconic phrase "It's a secret to everybody" in the process.


=== The Adventure of Link ===
Main articles: Orange Moblin and Red Moblin

In The Adventure of Link, Moblins were also originally called Molblins. They appear leaner and more muscular, as opposed to their short, squat appearance in the first game. Although their master, Ganon, is deceased, they continue to serve him and patrol the overworld of Hyrule. Moblins are common to the wooded areas of Hyrule, although some can be found on bridges or Caves. They attack by either jabbing or throwing their spears. Moblins appear in orange, red and blue, from weakest to strongest, respectively. Moblins are also capable of draining Link's Experience whenever he is attacked by one.


=== A Link to the Past ===
In A Link to the Past, Moblins only appear in the Dark World. This appearance marks the first occasion that they had a pig-like face, rather than that of a bulldog of previous games. They patrol the grounds in a quick fashion, and throw trident spears at Link from any distance within the screen. These projectiles can easily be blocked with the Shield. Although defensively weak, they can cause up to two Hearts of damage if they come in direct contact with Link. They commonly appear alongside Taros and Hinox.


=== Link's Awakening ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Moblins in the Mysterious Forest from Link's Awakening for Nintendo Switch 		 	 
In Link's Awakening, Moblins appear in two forms. The common forest-dwelling Moblins only appear in the Mysterious Woods and the Moblin Cave in Tal Tal Heights. Moblins simply wander and throw spears to attack. Some Moblins are instead armed with Swords and Shields and are known as Sword Moblins. These moblins resemble bulldogs like in the early games as opposed to Boarblins who resemble the pig moblins from A Link to the Past. They will charge after Link when they see him, like the Soldiers from A Link to the Past. Their blades are also able to parry Link's Sword. Their leader, known as the King Moblin, lives with a small horde in the Moblin Hideout. After Link clears the Tail Cave, he will find that the Moblins have captured Madam MeowMeow's BowWow. The King Moblin and his personal guards will defend their prize to the death.
In Link's Awakening for Nintendo Switch, both Moblins and Boarblins are porcine in appearance. Befitting the more porcine appearance, they are also heard emitting similar grunts to that of pigs and boars.


=== Ocarina of Time ===
In Ocarina of Time, Moblins only appear in the Sacred Forest Meadow when Link is an adult. They are much bigger than their previous appearances, and retain their original bulldog-like resemblance.  They patrol the hedge maze of the Forest Meadow and proceed to powerfully charge at Link with their spears whenever they see him. They can be killed by the Hookshot or Arrows, but are generally best avoided by stealth. With good timing, death by Sword is also a possibility.
A bigger and stronger variation of the Moblin, the Club Moblin, guards the entrance of the Forest Temple with a giant club. This giant Moblin carries an enormous club it slams on the ground when it sees Link, causing a shock wave which can prevent forward progress.
Neither type of Moblin can be Z-targeted, so Navi cannot comment on them.


=== Oracle of Seasons ===

In Oracle of Seasons, both the bulldog-like Moblins and Pig Warriors appear. They act the same as in the previous game, even coming in Sword-wielding variants, but now also come in colored varieties. Red Moblins are the most common, while the blue Moblins are rarer and stronger. In certain dungeons, red Moblins that throw Boomerangs also appear, similarly to Goriyas from previous games. Blue Moblins tend to appear during winter. A Golden Moblin also appears, which shows up after Link has spoken to an Old Man wearing a golden robe. The Moblin can be found in the Woods of Winter in the autumn. This variety is much more aggressive and far stronger than the ordinary varieties.
The Great Moblin is the boss of a gang of Pig Warriors. They operate a Keep, where the Great Moblin is fought as a miniboss. After his defeat, the Pig Warriors are driven away to the other land in a Linked Game. In Holodrum, after their defeat, they can be founded in Sunken City, forced to make innocent work by selling Bombs.
The Moblin Ring can be worn to transform Link into the appearance of a green Moblin.


=== Oracle of Ages ===
In Oracle of Seasons, both the bulldog-like Moblins and Pig Warriors appear. They act the same as in the previous game, even coming in Sword-wielding variants, but now also come in colored varieties. Red Moblins are the most common, while the blue Moblins are rarer and stronger. In certain dungeons, red Moblins that throw Boomerangs also appear, similarly to Goriyas from previous games. Blue Moblins often appear in the past while red ones are placed in the same region in the present.
The Great Moblin is the boss of a gang of Pig Warriors. They operate a Keep, where the Great Moblin is fought as a miniboss. After his defeat, the Pig Warriors are driven away to the other land in a Linked Game.
The Moblin Ring can be worn to transform Link into the appearance of a green Moblin.


=== Four Swords ===
Main articles: Spear Moblin and Bow Moblin
In Four Swords, Moblins appear in two forms: a melee spear type, and a ranged Bow type. Spear Moblins attack by charging at the Links with their spears, which can parry their Swords, whereas Bow Moblins shoot Arrows from afar. Their appearance is identical to the Moblins of The Wind Waker. 


=== The Wind Waker ===

In The Wind Waker, Moblins are once again Ganon's primary soldiers. Similarly to the Moblins of A Link to the Past, their appearance is distinctively more porcine-like. They are often seen patrolling Ganon's territories, such as Submarines, temples, and notably the Forsaken Fortress. Bokoblins and Miniblins often accompany them, and one Moblin in particular serves as the mini-boss of Dragon Roost Cavern. They are sometimes carried into battle on Kargarocs. There are two kinds of Moblins in The Wind Waker: brown and blue. The brown Moblins appear in the Forsaken Fortress, the Earth Temple, and the Fairy Woods at night time, as well as several Submarines and Caves. This variety can take more hits and carry Lanterns which they throw at Link when they spot him, acting as a smokescreen of sorts as well as to hurt him with fire. The blue Moblins cannot take as many hits and do not carry Lanterns.
Moblins are big and powerful, but not particularly intelligent. They carry spears, which can be picked up and wielded by Link when dropped. Moblins attack by swiping, stabbing, or crushing Link with their spears, which can inflict varying amounts of damage depending on the attack. These attacks also lowers the Moblin's defense, provided if Link can find a safe opening to strike back. Moblins have immense reach with their spears, but their wide swings mean that two or more Moblins in proximity are likely to injure or even kill each other or other enemies. If disarmed, a Moblin proceeds to unleash mighty, lightning-fast punches until it gets its spear back. These attacks send Link flying as he is hit. Moblins may also punch Link in certain instances followed by a spear attack, such as when Link raises his Shield. Link, however, will not sustain any damage from this punch. Moblins are also adept at handling a frontal assault by defending with their spears, so attacking from the sides or back is recommended. If Link strikes the rear-end, the Moblin will comically cry out and briefly hop around, due to the pain inflicted in a delicate place. Notably, Moblins are afraid of explosives, and will flee in terror if Link takes out a Bomb while engaged with a Moblin. They will return to the fight once the Bomb explodes.
While infiltrating the Forsaken Fortress to find and rescue his kidnapped sister, Link will encounter Moblins patrolling the fortress and will have to avoid them, on account that he had lost his Sword and is unable to fight them. Link can sneak past the Moblins by moving past them as they are facing away, or by picking up Barrels and hiding in them when a Moblin is nearby. If Link is caught by a Moblin, he will be thrown into an empty prison cell and will have to escape and reattempt. Once Link retrieves his Sword and revisits the Forsaken Fortress, he can fight the Moblins normally. Moblins also appear to have a keen sense of smell, as they appear to be sniffing out Link as he is sneaking through Forsaken Fortress.
Valuable Skull Necklaces can be stolen by using the Grappling Hook or won as spoils by defeating Moblins,which can be sold to Dampa near the Bomb Shop, Beedle, or to Maggie's Father in the Auction House after the second Forsaken Fortress mission.
Maggie from Windfall Island maintains a long-distance relationship with a Moblin named Moe who lives in the Forsaken Fortress. They communicate through letters, and Moe indicates a disturbing "hunger" to see Maggie. Maggie takes this to mean that he wants to marry her. It is apparent through Maggie's actions that she is in love with him, much to her father's disapproval.


=== The Minish Cap ===
Main articles: Spear Moblin and Bow Moblin
Both Spear and Bow Moblins appear as variants in The Minish Cap. They are identical to those in Four Swords; Spear Moblins charge at Link, while Bow Moblins shoot Arrows. Blue-colored Moblins also appear in the Dark Hyrule Castle, although their strength and resiliency is identical to the more common, brown-colored variety.
According to the Royal Hyrule Library's weekly top titles, the book "Married to the Moblin" is the top seller. However, Link cannot read the book in-game.


=== Skyward Sword ===
Main article: Shield Moblin
Shield Moblins appear as variants in Skyward Sword. They appear as obese red monsters with grotesque features, somewhat resembling the common, smaller Bokoblin. Their jowls are also somewhat more reminiscent of a bulldog. Shield Moblins in Skyward Sword come in two varieties: a Wooden Shield variant and a Metal Shield variant. Both types carry large, square-shaped Shields they use to defend with, and are equipped with spears for offense. Their Shields are highly durable; while it is possible to destroy a Moblin's Wooden Shield, the same cannot be done against the Metal Shield variety. Along with their superb defenses, their attacking power makes them elite enemies.


=== A Link Between Worlds ===
In A Link Between Worlds, Moblins are directly based on those from A Link to the Past. They appear throughout Lorule as common enemies. They come in two varieties: a spear-wielding type, and an armored sword and shield type. The spear-wielding Moblins have an identical appearance to those from A Link to the Past, but with a slightly different attack strategy. These Moblins now back away and try to maintain a distance away from Link as they aim their javelins at him, identically to the Spear Soldiers of Hyrule. The sword and shield Moblins are an armored variety that carry blades, or alternately a pitchfork, and a shield. They charge directly at Link when they see him, akin to the Sword Soldiers. Their shields are able to block Link's Sword, so it is advised to attack their unprotected backsides. Both Moblin varieties act as a slightly stronger version of their Hyrulean counterparts.


=== Tri Force Heroes ===
Main article: Spear Throwing Moblin
Spear Throwing Moblins are a named variant in Tri Force Heroes. They are identical to the spear-wielding Moblins of A Link Between Worlds, sharing the same model, attack strategy and pattern. Spear Throwing Moblins may also sometimes appear riding Totem Armos, requiring that the Links form a Totem to reach the Moblin's height to attack. A "dark" version of this Moblin also appears in the Den of Trials.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

In Breath of the Wild, Moblins have a lankier and taller stature than of previous games, which they sustain with an exclusively carnivorous diet. They often wield Moblin Clubs, which they use to bludgeon opponents, or Moblin Spears. When defeated, they may drop Moblin Fangs, Moblin Horns and Moblin Guts. If unarmed, they will sometimes pick up Bokoblins, if any are within reach, and toss them at Link. There are several variations of Moblin in the game. These include Blue Moblins, Black Moblins, Silver Moblins, Golden Moblins (only found in Master Mode), Stalmoblins and Cursed Moblins.


=== Sequel to Breath of the Wild ===

Moblins appear as Enemies in the Sequel to Breath of the Wild. They are similar in appearance to the incarnations in Breath of the Wild, but have a bone-like growth appearing on their heads.

== Trivia ==
"It's a secret to everybody", the iconic quote from The Legend of Zelda, refers to both the actual player, who must keep from friends and family the secret that Rupees can be found there, and to Moblins, as giving Rupees to Link means that they have betrayed their comrades.
According to Zelda.com, Moblins are greedy and only care about food and Rupees. This is also somewhat true in the games, particularly in the Oracle games.
In Encyclopedia, the Moblin image for The Legend of Zelda was instead that of a Red Goriya.


== Nomenclature ==
Moblins in The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link were known as "Molblins", a more exact transliteration of their Japanese name, モリブリン (Moriburin). Moriburin is a portmanteau of 森 (Forest), in reference to their common habitat, and "goblin." In later titles, the initial "L" was omitted.
