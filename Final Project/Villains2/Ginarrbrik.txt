He is based on the Witch's Dwarf from C.S. Lewis' fantasy novel, ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' serving as her minion.\n\n==Background==\nAn assistant of the White Witch, Ginarrbrik is loyal towards his master. He shows a strong dislike against [[Edmund Pevensie]] (and possibly humans in the land of Narnia). However, after Jadis dies during the final battle, Ginarrbrik then encounters Edmund who previously fought him and prepares to attack him, but he later dies after being hit by Susan's arrow in order to save Edmund.\n\n==Role in the film==\nGinarrbrik is first seen along with [[Jadis the White Witch|Jadis]] pulling their sleigh of reindeer. As Ginarrbrik attempts to attack [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], Jadis comes across him and later gives Edmund some Turkish delight to which Edmund enjoys it explaining that her home has a lot of Turkish delight just before Edmund gets off her sleigh as Ginarrbrik urges the reindeer to so he and Jadis can move on. Upon entering the White Witch's castle, Ginarrbrik stands next to Jadis who confronts Edmund for entering the castle alone and as Edmund asks Jadis for Turkish delight, Ginarrbrik takes Edmund to a room full of Turkish delight. However, this led to Edmund being confronted by Jadis again troubled by the Witch looking for [[Aslan]] just as Ginarrbrik attacks [[Tumnus|Mr. Tumnus]] telling Jadis that he doesn't know what Aslan is just as Ginarrbrik silences him before he and Jadis get ready to board their sleigh.\n\nNow as the winter turns into spring in Narnia, Ginarrbrik tells his master that it is much warmer than in winter while checking the sleigh. Ginarrbrik later ties up Edmund separating him from the Pevensies far away in the dark woods. [[Oreius]] and a group of centaurs arrive at Jadis' Camp to help protect Edmund from Ginarrbrik by tying him up to another tree much to [[General Otmin]]'s worry. Edmund, however, was freed afterwards. Later, Ginarrbrik is present during a meeting with Queen Jadis of Narnia much to the other Narnians upset for her betrayal to the residents living there. That night, Ginarrbrik is later present at the Stone Table during Aslan's sacrifice shaving Aslan's mane in a plan for Jadis to take over Narnia in revenge along with the other minions of Jadis' army just as Aslan dies during the sacrifice, much to [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]]'s sadness during the tragic sacrifice. After the sacrifice, Jadis alerts Otmin to prepare for battle to take over Narnia.\n\nDuring the battle of Beruna, Ginarrbrik, wearing battle gear, leaps down from the White Witch's chariot as the army prepares to fight against Aslan's army. As Otmin sends the minions of Jadis' army to attack, Ginarrbrik angrily wields his axe just as Otmin roars to bring in the signal just as the army starts charging across the battlefield in a plan to attack Aslan's Army. Furthermore, Ginarrbrik fires an arrow at Peter's unicorn, causing the unicorn to trip over and Peter to fall off of it, injuring him in progress (though the unicorn is shown to have survived after getting hit). \n\nIn the extended version of the film, Edmund runs across Ginarrbrik preparing to kill a dwarf part of Aslan's Army to which Edmund notices this and knocks him off with his sword, causing Ginarrbrik to fall off the ledge, finding himself lying down unconsciously in order to save the dwarf being attacked by Ginarrbrik.\n\nLater after Aslan, who is shown to have been revived, kills Jadis during battle, Ginarrbrik is the only surviving minion wandering around preparing to attack Edmund. Susan manages to use her bow and arrow to kill Ginarrbrik in order to save Edmund.\n\n==Video game appearances==\n=== ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game)]]''===\nGinarrbrik serves as the third boss in the video game adaptation of the Disney version of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in the \"Rescue Edmund\" level. Peter was able to defeat him by tying him up as well as being able to rescue Edmund from the dwarf, followed by the two encountering an ambush summoned by Jadis to which upon defeating two villainous cyclopes, the minions of Jadis' army chase the two until the centaurs arrive and rescue them from Jadis' Camp.\n\n==Differences from source material==\n*In the original story, Ginarrbrik is simply referred to as the '''Witch's Dwarf''' (though not given a proper name) whereas in the Disney version of the film, he is named \"Ginarrbrik\".\n**The name \"Ginarrbrik\" has been only used in the Disney adaptation of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and was not used in any other media inspired by it.\n*In the film, Ginarrbrik is seen eating Turkish delight for Edmund, which could be a possible clue of how the Dwarf from the original story became her slave.\n*In the film, Ginarrbrik dies being killed by Susan whereas in the original story, the Dwarf's fate is unknown though it is likely that he retreated along with the other members of the White Witch's army or died during battle since many minions of the White Witch's army died during battle.\n\n{{The Chronicles of Narnia}}\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]\n[[Category:Dwarfs]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
