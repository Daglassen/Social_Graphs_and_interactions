As in the original\u00a0''[[Treasure Island]]'', Pew is after the treasure map, accompanied by other former members of\u00a0[[Captain Flint]]'s crew. In contrast to the novel, where Pew's blindness enhanced his sinister qualities, his disability renders him a comic figure, grasping at a\u00a0moose head\u00a0and mistaking\u00a0[[Jim Hawkins (Muppet Treasure Island)|Jim Hawkins]]\u00a0for a girl. He also speaks with a\u00a0French accent.\n\nBlind Pew visits\u00a0the [[Admiral Benbow Inn]]\u00a0to give\u00a0Billy Bones\u00a0the black spot, indicating that Bones will soon die. He later returns with a gang of pirates, searching for Bones' treasure map. A lamp gets knocked over in the ruckus, setting the inn ablaze.\n\nPew is last seen wandering blindly through the flames, saying, \"I think I smell something burning, no?\" His fate is unknown.\n\nHe also appeared in the\u00a0[[Muppet Treasure Island\u00a0(video game)|''Muppet Treasure Island'' video game]]\u00a0and as a\u00a0gulag\u00a0(sans eyepatches) prisoner in\u00a0''[[Muppets Most Wanted]].''\n\nBlind Pew's hands were operated by\u00a0[[Bill Barretta]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nBlind Pew 2.jpg|Blind Pew in Muppets Most Wanted\nBlind Pew Art.png|Blind Pew art\nMuppet_B_Pew.jpg|Pew with Billy Bones\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{The Muppets}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Muppet Treasure Island characters]]\n[[Category:Muppets Most Wanted characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:The Muppets characters]]"
