He is an officer in the naval forces of the [[Galactic Empire]], charged with overseeing the [[Clone Troopers|Clone Trooper]] projects in the aftermath of the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|Clone Wars]]. Dismissive of the Clone Troopers because of their artificial origins and eager to use the new Empire to bring order to the galaxy, Rampart is placed in charge by his superior, Admiral [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], of leading Project War-Mantle; the construction of a brand new Imperial army composed of naturally born human recruits loyal to the New Order. Thus, Rampart serves as not only the leading figure in the end of the Clone Troopers\u2019 production but is also the creator of the Empire\u2019s iconic and infamous [[Stormtroopers]].\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Admirals]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
