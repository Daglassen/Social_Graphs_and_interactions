It is a BB-series droid like [[BB-8]], designed to move like a rotating ball, whose allegiance is with the [[First Order]].\n\n==Background==\n===Biography===\nBB-9E is one of the BB astromech units that belongs to the [[First Order]] and was assigned to Snoke's flagship, the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]''. There, it is responsible for keeping the machinery operational, making sure that the procedures are being followed and also checking for the presence of infiltrators or any potential threat inside the ship.\n\n===Personality===\nAlthough the BB-series astromech droid is usually a friendly model, BB-9E is cold and malevolent. This personality is result of being treated simply as a machine by the First Order, very different from the treatment that [[BB-8]] and other droids receive in the [[Resistance]]. In order to keep BB-9E submissive, the First Order would often erase its memory, but this ultimately did not prevent the droid from becoming malicious and it is especially mean while working to report threats inside the ''Supremacy''.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nAs they are from the same series of astromech droid, BB-9E and BB-8 look very similar, except for their colors. Instead of being white and orange, BB-9E is dark colored. It is a black and rounded droid with a square-domed head, silver markings and vents. It has a red optic sensor that it is kept out to detect intruders.\n\n==Appearances== \n===''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''===\nIn the film, BB-9E is responsible for revealing BB-8, [[Finn]] and [[Rose Tico]] while they are disguised as First Order officers to go undercover on the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]'', resulting in them being captured by [[Captain Phasma]] and her followers.\n\n===''Star Wars Blips''===\nBB-9E makes an appearance in the episode \"Hey You\", where BB-8 bumps into BB-9E trying to provoke it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*On set, BB-9E was nicknamed \"BB-H8\" (pronounced \"BB-Hate\").\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe Last Jedi First Order Posters 02.jpg\nBB-9E and BB-8.jpg|BB-9E and [[BB-8]].\nBB-9E.png\nThe Last Jedi 133.jpg\nBB-8 BB-9E Star Wars Blips.jpg|BB-9E and BB-8 in ''Star Wars Blips''.\nBB-9E (Roblox item).png|BB-9E in ''[[Roblox]]''.\nBB-8 BB-9E Battlefront II.png|BB-9E and BB-8 in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.\nBB-8 and BB-9E Battlefront II.jpg \nToy BB-9E.jpg|Sphero\nlego-bb-9e.jpg|[[LEGO]]\nFunko POP - BB-9E 1.jpg|[[Funko|Funko POP!]]\nTLJ - BB-9E.png\nHot-toys BB-9E.jpg\nTLJ Cosbaby Bobble-Heads BB-9E.jpg\nRose, BB-8 and BB-9E Hasbro.jpg\nBB-9E TLJ Vinylmation.jpg\nItty Bittys Star Wars The Last Jedi BB-9E.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|BB-9E}}\n*{{SW|url=/databank/bb-9e|text=BB-9E}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n\n[[Category:Droids]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Sequel Trilogy characters]]\n[[Category:First Order characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Resistance characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
