They constructed four mechanical wonders to be known as the Divine Beasts.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Four [[Champion]]s were picked to pilot the Divine Beasts, who launched a full-scale attack on [[Ganon]],<ref>{{Cite|The Divine Beasts were piloted by four individuals of exceptional skill from across the land. And thus, the plan to neutralize Ganon was formed.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> headed by a princess and a hero wielding the [[Master Sword]]. With their overwhelming technological might, their efforts were successful and Ganon was sealed away for thousands of years.<ref>{{Cite|Upon Ganon's inevitable return to Hyrule, the princess and the hero fought alongside these four Champions against this ancient evil. The Guardians were tasked with protecting the hero as the Divine Beasts unleashed a furious attack upon their terrible foe. And when the hero wielding the sword that seals the darkness delivered his final blow... The princess used her sacred power to seal away Calamity Ganon.|Impa|BotW}}</ref>\n\n110 years before the events of {{BotW}}, the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]] was warned by a fortune teller of Ganon's return.<ref>{{Cite|Reports keep arriving regarding the excavation of relics. The fortune teller's predictions seem to be coming true. Calamity Ganon was not a figure of fable, or even of legend. He actually existed in our great land of Hyrule. We must investigate all the relics, learn as much as we can. But understanding the Divine Beasts alone will take time... Zelda's eyes lit up like a wildfire when I told her about the relics... I must admit, she has a knack for research.|King Rhoam's Journal|BotW}}</ref> In preparation of stopping Ganon's return, the Divine Beasts were rediscovered after being excavated and four new Champions were chosen to pilot them.<ref>{{Cite|But there was also...a prophecy. \"The signs of a resurrection of Calamity Ganon are clear. And the power to oppose it lies dormant beneath the ground.\" We decided to heed the prophecy and began excavating large areas of land. It wasn't long before we discovered several ancient relics made by the hands of our distant ancestors. These relics, the Divine Beasts, were giant machines piloted by warriors.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> The [[Gerudo]] chief [[Urbosa]] was chosen to operate Naboris.<ref>{{Cite|Still, the {{Color|BotW Red|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}} remains. That one was controlled by Urbosa of the Gerudo.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> It was also during this time that Naboris served as the protector of the [[Gerudo]] people of [[Gerudo Desert]].<ref>{{Cite|You crossed the Gerudo Desert to get here, right? So you must have seen the giant walking around outside... It appeared suddenly a few weeks ago. It's a daunting sight. If you get too close to it, it'll lash out at you with lightning. I can't imagine what would happen if it came to town... The {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}} says that thing used to be a god who protected this area around 100 years ago...|Fegran|BotW}}</ref><ref name=\"Crisp\">{{Cite|That's the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}}. They say it used to be a god who protected this area, but... It suddenly appeared a little while ago and just started walking around aimlessly. Everyone's afraid that it may wander into town eventually. The {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}} is doing what she can about it, but... I heard a rumor that if you get too close to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}}, it will shoot you with lightning and burn you to a crisp. All we can do is hope that it doesn't come this way...|Lashley|BotW}}</ref> However, despite [[Link]]'s, [[Princess Zelda]]'s and the four Champions' best efforts and preparations, Ganon surprised them by corrupting and taking control of the Divine Beasts.<ref>{{Cite|The princess, her appointed knight, and the rest of the Champions were on the brink of sealing away Ganon... But nay... Ganon was cunning, and he responded with a plan beyond our imagining. He appeared from deep below Hyrule Castle, seized control of the Guardians and the Divine Beasts, and turned them against us.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa was killed by [[Thunderblight Ganon]], a being created by Ganon to seize control of Naboris.<ref name=\"Warrior's Demise\">{{Cite|Stay on your edge, Link! This formidable adversary was made by Ganon and brought me to a warrior's demise 100 years ago. Do not allow this to be your end.

Those residing in the castle as well. The appointed knight, gravely wounded, collapsed while defending the princess... And thus, the kingdom of Hyrule was devastated absolutely by Calamity Ganon. However... The princess survived...to face Ganon alone.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref>\n\nA century later, Ganon's power grew strong enough to remotely control the Divine Beasts once more even in his imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite|Somehow, Ganon has maintained control over all four Divine Beasts, as well as those Guardians swarming around Hyrule Castle.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> Under Ganon's control, Naboris wanders the [[East Barrens]] of the Gerudo Desert, threatening the inhabitants of Gerudo Desert with the risk of being struck from its lightning should it travel too close.<ref name=\"Crisp\"/> Until Link arrives to calm Naboris, it caused problems for people in the Gerudo Desert, obstructing travel and deterring visitors.<ref>{{Cite|If only that {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} wasn't around. I would already be back at {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}}... [Divine Beast?] When I say {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}}, I'm talking about that giant thing roaming around the desert... It's been kicking up bad sandstorms, and apparently it'll blast you with lightning if you get too close! The thought of getting zapped is terrifying. I can't risk traveling to {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}}...|Konora|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Grr... We've lost a lot of business ever since that {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} started stomping out in the desert.|Kachoo|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Entrance to the Divine Beast==\nIn order to stop Naboris, Link must enter [[Gerudo Town]] and seek counsel with [[Riju]], the Gerudo chief, and offer to quell it. Interested by Link's offer, Riju informs Link that her precious heirloom, the [[Thunder Helm]], was stolen and tasks him with retrieving it from the [[Yiga Clan Hideout]].<ref>{{Cite|A voe within our walls is a great crime. But a voe who is a {{Color|BotW Blue|Champion}}... Well, we'd never mistreat a friend of {{Color|BotW Blue|Lady Urbosa}}. And if you're here to help us with {{Color|BotW Blue|Naboris}}, then we are allies. You saw it on your way to our town. {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}}, cloaked in a massive sandstorm, hurling lightning at any who dare approach. We have to do something to stop it, but we have yet to find any way to appease the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} on our own. If you truly are a Champion, perhaps you will be able to enter {{Color|BotW Blue|Naboris}} and calm its anger.|Riju|BotW}}<br>{{Cite|Lady Riju! I don't see how you can trust a complete stranger with something as important as this task. Perhaps if this person were first to prove his worth by recovering your stolen Thunder Helm...|Buliara|BotW}}<br>{{Cite|Ah, yes... An interesting suggestion. You see, there is only one thing in all of Hyrule that can withstand the {{Color|BotW Blue|lightning}} from {{Color|BotW Blue|Naboris}}. The {{Color|BotW Red|Thunder Helm}}, a family heirloom and relic of the Gerudo. But as Buliara says, it was stolen from us.|Riju|BotW}}<br>{{Cite|You needn't worry, Lady Riju. If he truly is a Champion, this should be an easy task for him. Our soldiers can tell you all you need to know about the thieves who stole Lady Riju's heirloom.|Buliara|BotW}}</ref> After successfully returning the Thunder Helm, Riju dons it and instructs Link to meet with her at the [[Lookout Post]] south of Gerudo Town.<ref>{{Cite|The threat {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}} poses has only grown since we began searching for the heirloom. I believe that Gerudo Town itself may be in danger before too long... As chief, and as a Gerudo, I must find some way to stop that thing before it threatens my people. Will you help me? [Of course!] Heheh, who would have thought that, just before such a momentous battle...hearing a simple, confident pledge of support from you would be what puts me at ease? I'll head out now. Let's meet up at the {{Color|BotW Red|lookout post}} {{Color|BotW Blue|south of town}}.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Before leaving, she mentions that the only way to get close to Naboris is by riding a {{Term|BotW|Sand Seal|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|There's only one way to get close to {{Color|BotW Blue|Naboris}}, and that's with the help of a {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seal}}. The {{Color|BotW Red|lookout post}} isn't too far from town, but you should take a {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seal}} there. You can get some practice in that way. I'll be waiting for you with my favorite sand seal, Patricia.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Upon meeting with Riju at the Lookout Post, she will tell Link of her plan to take down Naboris. The first stage of her plan is to draw close to Naboris with {{Plural|BotW|Sand Seal|link}},<ref>{{Cite|What a sight. {{Color|BotW Red|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}} is pretty intimidating... If we want to get close enough to that thing, we'll need to use {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seals}}... Are you ready? [Of course!] Feeling confident? Good. Let's get going, then! First, we'll use the {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seals}} to get in really close to that thing. I'll take the lead.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> which are capable of quickly crossing vast distances of desert sand. The second portion of her plan is to use [[Bomb Arrow]]s to damage Naboris' feet, inhibiting its ability to draw power from the ground.<ref>{{Cite|I'm counting on you to {{Color|BotW Blue|shoot}} at its feet with {{Color|BotW Blue|bomb arrows}}. Naboris draws energy from the ground to keep moving. If you damage the feet, I think you can stop it. Those lightning strikes, though... Getting hit even once could prove fatal. The {{Color|BotW Blue|Thunder Helm}} can repel the lightning strikes, protecting me from harm. But it can also shield a limited area around me... You'll have to stay close if you don't want to be shocked. And listen... If you're too injured to keep fighting, promise me {{Color|BotW Red|you'll retreat here, to the lookout post}}. Don't do anything reckless under any circumstances.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> To this end, Riju gifts Link with a bundle of twenty Bomb Arrows.<ref>{{Cite|Here are some Gerudo {{Color|BotW Blue|bomb arrows}}. There aren't many, so be sure to put them to good use.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> If Link consents to the plan, Riju will guide Link out into the desert and perform a brief ritual, calling for help in their mission from the ancestors of the Gerudo.<ref>{{Cite|This is the last time I'll ask... Are you ready? [Of course!] [...] Could you give me a bit of room, just for a moment? My name is Riju, descendant of the royal line and leader of the Gerudo people! With the power of the heirloom passed down in my family, I shall calm the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}}. Ancestors of the Gerudo! Answer my call! Aid me in this task!|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Responding to her ritual, the Thunder Helm creates an electrified barrier which encompasses both Link and Riju. Offering one more plea to Urbosa, Riju begins her charge towards Naboris.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, wow! I can feel their power coursing through me! Let's move! [...] {{Color|BotW Blue|Lady Urbosa}}... Please grant Link and me your protection...|Riju|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIn order to successfully subdue Naboris, Link must strike each of its four hooves with Bomb Arrows twice. When near Naboris, it will draw in energy to fire a powerful bolt of lightning at Link, potentially damaging him if he is not within the protective radius of Riju's Thunder Helm. Upon striking Naboris' hooves with Bomb Arrows enough times, it will temporarily shut down, causing its legs to buckle and its body to fall to the ground. As she is unable to face the obstacles within, Riju bids Link well in completing the task to calm Naboris alone.<ref>{{Cite|Unfortunately, I cannot appease Naboris on my own. I have no choice but to entrust the rest to you.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Once Link is inside Naboris, it will resume moving and he will activate the Divine Beast's [[Travel Gate]]. After doing so, Urbosa will call to him, announcing her anticipation for the moment that they can wrest control of Naboris back from Ganon.<ref>{{Cite|Well, well, well... You sure do know how to keep a woman waiting. I can't wait to see you take Naboris back from Ganon!|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to enter Naboris without Riju's assistance, as its hooves are submerged under the desert sands before Riju joins Link. Additionally, its feet will not react to being struck by Bomb Arrows. Its electric attacks will deal a base 32 points of damage to Link, even if he has the Unshockable [[Set Bonus]] from the [[Rubber Armor]] set active.\n\n==Themes and Navigation==\n[[File:BotW Divine Beast Vah Naboris Icon.png|right]]\nNaboris is heavily-themed around electricity and utilizing electric currents in conjunction with circuits to activate puzzles and manipulate components within its body. Upon entry to Naboris, Urbosa instructs Link to find the [[Guidance Stone]] that will download a map of Naboris onto his [[Sheikah Slate]].<ref>{{Cite|One thing at a time. You'll need a map to find your way around. Head over to that {{Color|BotW Red|Guidance Stone}} over there. Sounds easy, right?|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Sheikah Slate authenticated. Distilling map of Divine Beast.|Guidance Stone|BotW}}</ref> Should Link need to leave Naboris, he may do so by directly warping out with the Sheikah Slate's map, or by standing atop the Travel Gate to be taken directly to the entrance of the aforementioned Lookout Post. The entrance to Naboris is a sort of undercarriage accompanying its torso, with a small flight of stairs leading upwards into the interior its torso. The archway connecting the flight of stairs is obstructed by a formation of Malice attached to a Glowing Eyeball, which must be destroyed in order to advance.\n\nThe interior of the torso is divided into three primary cylinders which feature a complex system of multi-leveled platforms with the main control unit situated on the middle cylinder. The sides of the torso feature a set of three apertures on each side with the two closest to Naboris' head obstructed by cracked tile walls that must be destroyed with explosives in order to pass through. The Guidance Stone that will distill the map of Naboris is set in an antechamber at the far rear of the torso. Upon activating it, a 3D map of Naboris will appear in place of the Sheikah Slate's map of Hyrule while Link is inside Naboris. The five terminals needed to activate the main control unit will appear as glowing points throughout Naboris' map and Link will gain the ability to rotate the three cylindrical sections of Naboris' torso by increments of 90 degrees to reposition the platforms inside.<ref>{{Cite|Good work getting the map of the Divine Beast! The {{Color|BotW Red|terminals}} that {{Color|BotW Red|control}} Naboris are noted by a series of glowing points on your map. Take Naboris back by activating all of the {{Color|BotW Red|terminals}}. You're ready for this.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Divine Beast controls have been enabled.|Guidance Stone|BotW}}</ref> The map also shows Link's position within Naboris and allows him to exit it remotely by pressing the X button while viewing the map. The map shows the primary, trisected circuit along the internal cylinders, coloring them either green or orange to indicate whether the circuits are closed or open, respectively. Two are closed by default, while the one along the ceiling closest to Naboris' neck is open. The power source for the circuits is located on the underside of the platform supporting the main control unit, perpetually powering the central circuit.\n\nTwo of the five terminals within Naboris are located within the cylindrical torso chamber. One terminal, located along the cylinder closest to Naboris' neck, is accessible when the circuit is positioned at the top. The other terminal is set in a small chamber along the back cylinder, which can only be entered by rotating the cylinder 180 degrees and entering from the connecting chamber in Naboris' right hip. The terminal can only be activated by rotating the cylinder an additional 90 degrees upon entering the chamber, setting its pedestal upright. A third terminal is located on the middle floor of Naboris' first hump, protected by Malice connected to a Glowing Eyeball. A fourth terminal is situated in the lowest chamber connecting Naboris' humps together, protected by a portcullis that can only be released by placing two electric orbs along the small pedestals with circuits connecting to nodes above the portcullis. The final terminal is located inside Naboris' head, which can be accessed only by forcing Naboris to retract its neck in a vertical position by electrifying the two nodes at the base of its neck. This creates an elevator that will carry Link towards Naboris' head.\n\nUpon activating all of the terminals, Urbosa congratulates Link and directs him towards the main control unit in the center of Naboris' torso.<ref>{{Cite|Well done! That was the last of the {{Color|BotW Red|terminals}}. Now...you'll need to start up the {{Color|BotW Red|main control unit}}! Take a good look at your map. Head for the glowing mark you see there. You're doing well...but overconfidence can be a deadly foe.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> If Link approaches and attempts to activate the main control unit, he will be stopped by [[Thunderblight Ganon]], which will manifest himself behind Link and attack. Urbosa warns Link that it was Thunderblight Ganon that slew her a century ago as the battle for control of Naboris begins.<ref name=\"Warrior's Demise\"/> Throughout the fight with Thunderblight Ganon, Urbosa will offer advice and commentary to Link about his foe.<ref>{{Cite|This thing is fast! Watch yourself.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce Thunderblight Ganon has been defeated, Link will be able to activate the main control unit controlling Naboris, at the expense of being unable to enter it again.<ref>{{Cite|Once you activate the main control unit, you will not be able to reenter the interior of this Divine Beast. Do you still wish to activate it?|N/A|BotW}}</ref> In doing so, Link frees Urbosa's spirit, which was trapped within Naboris over the course of the century under Ganon's control.<ref>{{Cite|I knew you wouldn't let us down, Link. Thanks to your valor and skill, my soul is free and Naboris is ours once again. Which means that finally...we can complete what we started years ago. We Gerudo have no tolerance for unfinished business.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa thanks Link for liberating her, and offers him her unique ability to command a flurry of lightning, called [[Urbosa's Fury]].<ref>{{Cite|I've waited so long for the moment to see you finally rush Hyrule Castle... As well as for the moment when I incinerate Ganon into a pile of ash. Which reminds me, I wanted to give you a little something. Please accept this gift, which has come to be known as Urbosa's Fury. It will no doubt be of use to you.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Afterwards, she asks Link to reassure Princess Zelda that the events which unfolded a century ago were out of her control and that she is not to blame for what resulted from Ganon's attack.<ref>{{Cite|But you and the princess...I know you have suffered much regarding what happened to us Champions. But this is how things had to happen. No one need carry blame. So please, make it clear so she understands that. Tell her to shed any worries. And let her know...I couldn't be more proud of her.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Bidding farewell to Link,<ref>{{Cite|You take good care of the princess. Oh, and also... Take good care of Hyrule.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa guides Naboris to Spectacle Rock's southern mesa where she anticipates the moment that they can achieve their revenge on Ganon.<ref name=\"Nabooru\">{{Cite|Nabooru... Legend of the Gerudo, celebrated over ages. And you, who were named to honor her\u2014you are a legend as well. Isn't that right, Naboris? The bitter essence of defeat from a century ago still sits upon my tongue... But that is now in the past... It was written that Calamity Ganon once adopted the form of a Gerudo. And that...will make this victory all the more satisfying. I like that. Now I can take this personally. Once we've established a lock on that thing... It will be up to Link to keep Ganon occupied until the moment we unleash our strike. That moment...is going to be so delicious.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref>\n\nA stone chest sitting on a sideways platform above and to the left of the main control unit holds a [[Knight's Bow]]. A second stone chest on the inverse of this platform, guarded by a formation of Malice and a Glowing Eyeball, contains an [[Ancient Shaft]]. A metallic chest can be found suspended by a rope near Naboris' tail, which Link can detach to retrieve the Ancient Core inside. A stone chest containing five [[Bomb Arrow]]s rests in a room along Naboris' hip which can be accessed from Naboris' exterior. A metallic chest containing an [[Ancient Spring]] sits within a chamber sealed by a cracked tile wall along Naboris' right shoulder, accessible only from the cylindrical torso chamber. On the far end of the interior of Naboris' neck, which can only be accessed while it is relaxed, rests a stone chest that contains a [[Knight's Shield]]. A stone chest, hidden on a ledge that is accessible only when the Divine Beast's rear dome is relaxed, contains an [[Ancient Gear]]. A metallic chest containing an [[Ancient Screw]] sits atop a ledge between the first and second floor of Naboris' second hump. The third floor of this hump also bears a stone chest containing a [[Topaz]].\n\n===Minor Enemies and Traps===\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Cursed Bokoblin Model.png|[[Cursed Bokoblin]]\nFile:BotW Cursed Lizalfos Model.png|[[Cursed Lizalfos]]\nFile:BotW Cursed Moblin Model.png|[[Cursed Moblin]]\nFile:BotW Floor Spikes Model.png|[[Floor Spikes]]\nFile:BotW Glowing Eyeball Model.png|[[Glowing Eyeball]]\nFile:BotW Guardian Scout II Model.png|[[Guardian Scout II]]\nFile:BotW Malice Model.png|[[Pool of Malice]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nDivine Beast Vah Naboris is named after [[Nabooru]],<ref name=\"Nabooru\"/> the Sage of Spirit from {{OoT}}.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Naboris Feet.png|The feet of the Divine Beast Vah Naboris\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Naboris Interior.png|The interior of the Divine Beast Vah Naboris\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Naboris Excavation.png|The Divine Beast Vah Naboris being excavated\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Naboris Map.png|The Sheikah Slate's Map of the Divine Beast Vah Naboris in its default state\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Naboris Map 2.png|The Sheikah Slate's Map of the Divine Beast Vah Naboris in its fully-operational state\nFile:BotW J\u014dmon Patterns Concept Artwork.png|Concept artwork of the Divine Beast Vah Naboris\nFile:HWAoC Divine Beast Vah Naboris Render.png|Render of Divine Beast Vah Naboris from ''Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{DungeonNav2|BotW}}\n{{Categories\n |Divine Beasts, Gerudo Desert, Gerudo Highlands\n |dungeons= BotW\n |objects= BotW, HWAoC\n}}"
