He has brown eyes, chrome rims, and three headlights and a tire on his roof rack. Only his front right fender matches his green paint, while the front right fender is light blue, and the rear fenders are yellow. He is modeled after a [[1967]] Baja Bug, which is a modification of a Volkswagen Beetle.<ref name=\"EW\">[http://family-room.ew.com/2014/03/13/cars-short-radiator-springs-500/ Lightning McQueen revs his engine off-road in Pixar's new Radiator Springs short -- EXCLUSIVE]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cars Toons]]''===\nShifty is first introduced in ''[[The Radiator Springs 500\u00bd]]'', where he goes with [[Sandy Dunes]], [[Blue Grit]] and [[Idle Threat]] to [[Radiator Springs]] to meet [[Lightning McQueen]]. Upon seeing that McQueen is dressed up like [[Stanley (Cars)|Stanley]], Shifty admits that Stanley should have still kept searching for anything other than Radiator Springs. His pals' insults are enough to make McQueen challenge them to an off-road race.\n\n[[Mater]] gives them the course before they start the race, telling them that when they come to a fork in the path, they must go left. However, they all get confused with him saying \"left is right\", and all of them turn right, not knowing that Mater actually meant \"left is correct\" or that they are on the wrong path. Shifty and the other racers all find themselves going over bumpy hills, through a cactus patch, inside the Tailpipe Caverns, and finally in a creepy forest covered with corpses. Feeling frightened, Shifty and the others head back to Radiator Springs, surprised about how tough they thought Stanley would have been.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Cars: Fast as Lightning]]''===\nShifty is a playable character in the mobile game ''Cars: Fast as Lightning''. He was added in downloadable content released in August [[2015]] for the 1.3.0 update. Gems are required to unlock him, and when he is unlocked, he comes to Radiator Springs and meets up with Todd Marcus, telling him that he is joining the exhibition. However, Shifty does not have his own race track, as well as Sandy, Blue Grit and Idle, meaning that players have to use them on other characters' race tracks.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nPixar Post - Radiator Springs 500 and a half - Green Jeep.png\n6.JPG\nRadiator springs 500 1-2 1.jpg\nPixar Post - Radiator Springs 500 and a Half 17.png\nShifty Sidewinder diecast.jpg|Die-cast\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*His model is based on a [[1967]] Volkswagen Beetle, heavily modified as a Baja Bug. His racing number is a reference to his model year.<ref name=EW>[http://family-room.ew.com/2014/03/13/cars-short-radiator-springs-500/ Lightning McQueen revs his engine off-road in Pixar's new Radiator Springs short -- EXCLUSIVE]</ref>\n**The style of the roundel seems to be an allusion to a [[Herbie|Beetle]] from [[The Love Bug|another Disney movie]].\n*His die-cast has green rims instead of chrome ones.\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:pixar:Shifty Sidewinder|Pixar Wiki: Shifty Sidewinder]]\n*[[w:c:worldofcarsdrivein:Shifty Sidewinder|World of Cars Wiki: Shifty Sidewinder]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Cars}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sidewinder, Shifty}}\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Cars characters]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Race Cars]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]"
