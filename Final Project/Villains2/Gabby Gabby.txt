My name is Gabby Gabby.|Gabby Gabby|Toy Story 4}}\n\n'''Gabby Gabby''' is the main antagonist-turned-supporting character of the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]\u2022[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''. She is a vintage doll created in the [[1950]]s who used to live in [[Second Chance Antiques]], desiring to get the attention of a little girl named Harmony.\n==Background==\nGabby Gabby is a pull-string talking doll from the 1950s. But unfortunately for her, a manufacturing defect in her pull-string voice box has left her sounding anything but adorable. She has spent more than 60 years forgotten in the depths of a jam-packed antique store\u2014her only companions are a band of voiceless ventriloquist dummies. Gabby Gabby knows someone will want her if only she can find a working voice box to repair hers.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes featurette \"Gabby Gabby & Her Gang\" further explained her backstory\u2013she did have an owner who bought her new back in the late 1950s, but as it was discovered that she had a defective voice box, she was given away and eventually found herself in an antique store.\n\n==Personality==\nBefitting a girl's doll of her kind, Gabby generally speaks and acts in a polite and well-spoken manner, rarely if ever raising her voice towards others, let alone get angry, though she is generally viewed as a pariah among her toy peers at the antique shop, with some like [[Giggle McDimples]] referring to her as either a \"creep\" or a \"weirdo\", partly due to her association with the [[The Bensons|Bensons]]. Despite her initial antagonism towards [[Woody]] and the gang, she is of good character from within, only driven more by desperation from having been trapped in the antique store than genuinely malicious intent.\n\nWhile she and her subordinates did resort to drastic measures in her attempt at getting the voice box she desired, she ultimately never intended to hurt anyone, instead handling situations in a professional manner, in one scene chastising her personal aide for hastily shoving Woody and Forky in her stroller, and in a later scene calmly reasoning with Woody over her need for a child to play with her. She reaches an agreement with Woody to surrender his voice box, and gives the cowboy doll's demands in return without any consequences, and unlike [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear]], who became embittered and vengeful over being abandoned and forgotten, Gabby never showed any sort of negative sentiment or feelings of betrayal, despite being rejected by Harmony as an \"uninteresting\" doll. While she did feel disappointed and crushed by the rejection, Gabby accepts the fact that there is more to her world than just Harmony, and became open to being adopted by other girls.\n\nThrough this, it can be assumed that she is more of an anti-hero or a tragic anti-villain than an outright villain of malicious nature. Gabby's personality is in marked contrast to the heartless sadism of Lotso and the embittered resentment by [[Stinky Pete]] in previous films. Like [[Sid Phillips|Sid]], who vowed never to hurt a toy again after being scarred for life from the toys who scared him into submission, Gabby accepts a chance to reform after being shown the error of her ways, voluntarily having herself adopted by a lost girl in atonement for her bad deeds.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Toy Story 4]]''===\nShe first encounters [[Woody]] and [[Forky]] when she and Benson are going out for their evening stroll. When she hears that Woody was looking for [[Bo Peep]], she offers him a ride, initially offering to help Woody. But even though he refuses, she insists on it, and the [[The Bensons|Bensons]] \u2013 mute ventriloquist dummies who serve as her enforcers \u2013 put Woody and Forky into the carriage. It is then revealed that Gabby is, in fact, a defective talking doll who spent most of her existence having a malfunctioning voice box, after noticing Woody has one that works, which she wants. As the years passed, Gabby had been sitting unused in the antique store, desperate to work again so she can get adopted by Harmony, the granddaughter of the antique store owner whom is frequently given free toys from there.\n\nWoody manages to escape from the antique store, while Forky is captured, who Gabby Gabby babysits and quizzes him on everything he knows about Woody. When Harmony visits the store once again, playing tea with a nearby tea set, Gabby Gabby practices playing at the same time, Forky giving her pointers. Later, when Bo Peep, Woody, [[Buzz Lightyear]], [[Giggle McDimples]], [[Ducky and Bunny|Ducky]], [[Ducky and Bunny|Bunny]], and [[Duke Caboom]] try to rescue Forky, they run into Gabby Gabby, who wanted to talk with Woody, and they escape, but not with Forky.\n\nAfter Woody\u2019s friends leave him, he agrees to give his voice box to Gabby in exchange for Forky, much to the latter\u2019s delight. After the Bensons remove his voice box, Gabby hugs Woody and thanks him warmly before bidding him and Forky a fond farewell. As Woody and Forky were about to sneak back into Bonnie\u2019s backpack, Forky watches Gabby from a distance as she calls for Harmony\u2019s attention by pulling the string on her newly-repaired voice box. Harmony notices Gabby and picks her up, but callously dismissed her as uninteresting and throws her aside in a box.\n\nA discouraged and heartbroken Gabby offers Woody to give his voice box back as she \u201cdoesn\u2019t need it anymore\u201d, but Woody insists she keep it. She tells Woody to stay away from her at first but eventually joins the gang after being offered a chance to be loved by Bonnie. Bo and the gang (except Buzz) return and help Woody, and Gabby Gabby get to Bonnie\u2019s RV.\n\nAfter Duke Caboom gets the gang to the ground, Ducky and Bunny cue Gabby Gabby to a lost girl, who decides to keep her. The lost girl is reunited with her parents by a security guard, and Gabby Gabby leaves with her new owner after silently thanking Woody and the gang, proudly falling asleep on the child\u2019s shoulder as Bonnie and her family arrive back at the RV park.\n\n==Printed media==\n===''Toy Story 4'' comic===\n[[File:Gabby TS4 comic.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gabby Gabby as she appears in the comic]]\nGabby Gabby appears as a minor character in the tie-in comic, specifically in the prequel segment \"Chip Off The Old Block\" where her portrayal in the film as a sort-of crime boss is further shown. [[Bo Peep]] and [[Giggle McDimples]] were looking for [[Billy, Goat, and Gruff]] when they encounter Gabby and two of the Bensons who were blocking their way. It turns out that Bo Peep's sheep somehow wound up in Gabby's care; the doll politely handed them back to Bo and led them to [[Tinny]]'s nightclub inside the pinball machine in exchange for a pearl necklace for Gabby to wear while playing dress-up.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite her initial antagonistic role as manipulative and covetous, she wasn't actually evil throughout the film, as she neither abused nor tortured [[Forky]] or [[Billy, Goat, and Gruff]]. Also, she didn't hurt Woody while she got his voice box, as the Bensons worked carefully with him. Gabby also kept her promise to him as she released Forky and Bo Peep's sheep after she received his voice box.\n*Gabby Gabby is based on [[w:c:twilightzone:Talky Tina|Talky Tina]] from the ''{{WikipediaLink|The Twilight Zone}}'' episode \"[[Wikipedia:Living Doll (The Twilight Zone)|Living Doll]]\", who is in turn based off the popular {{WikipediaLink|Chatty Cathy}} line of talking dolls from Mattel. Director Josh Cooley also cites [[w:c:godfather:Vito Corleone|Vito Corleone]] from ''The Godfather'' film series as an influence for Gabby's control over the Benson dummies who served as her enforcers.\n*Gabby Gabby sulking in the crate after being rejected by Harmony and Woody comforting her was based on [[Penny (The Rescuers)|Penny]] being rejected by a couple and the orphanage cat [[Rufus (The Rescuers)|Rufus]] also comforting her in the 1977 Disney animated film ''[[The Rescuers]]''.\n*Gabby Gabby is similar to [[Zarina]] from ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''. Not only are they both voiced by [[Christina Hendricks]], they are also both misunderstood by the main protagonist and they both are main villains who redeemed in the film.\n*The plates on the top of the cabinet where Gabby Gabby sits at have the same designs of ''[[Brave]]'' and ''[[Up]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGabby Gabby.png\nToy Story 4 official poster.jpg\nToy Story 4 (20).png\nToy Story 4 (21).png\nToy Story 4 (47).png\nToystory4-animationscreencaps.com-8583.jpg\nToystory4-animationscreencaps.com-8588.jpg\nFbcvf.jpg|Gabby Gabby Funko POP!\nEfdsef.jpg\nGnvbc.jpg\nFsef.jpg\nToy Story 4 poster 2.jpg\nToy Story 4 - Gabby Gabby.jpg\nTS4 - Gabby Gabby portrait.jpg\nGabby Disney Arena render.png|T-pose render for Gabby Gabby in [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]].\nToyStory4Minis.jpg\nGabby-gabby.png|Gabby Gabby Clip art\nGabby-gabby-toy-story4.png\nToy story 4 gabby gabby 564.jpg\nDisney pixar toy story 4 gabby gabby.jpg\nToy story 4 gabby gabby woody 354534.jpg\nGabby Gabby (Toy Story 4).jpeg\nDSA Gabby Gabby.png|Model for [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nWoody Bo Peep Ducky Bunny Gabby Gabby.jpg\nWoody & Gabby Gabby.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Toy Story}}\n[[fr:Gabby Gabby]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Dolls]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
