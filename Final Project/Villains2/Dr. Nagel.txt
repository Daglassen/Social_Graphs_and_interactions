Dr. Wilfred Nagel is the man you wanna thank. Or... condemn, depending on what side of this you're on.|[[Selby]] to [[Baron Zemo]]|Power Broker (episode)}}\n\n'''Dr. Wilfred Nagel''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], who appears in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier]]''.  He makes his only appearance in the [[Power Broker (episode)|third episode]] and is portrayed by Olli Haaskivi.\n\nDr. Nagel is responsible for recreating the [[Super Soldier Serum|super soldier serum]], which grants individuals enhanced abilities. He initially worked under [[HYDRA]], until it fell. Nagel was one of the many individuals to disappear during the [[Avengers: Infinity War|Blip]], and when he returned, he resumed his work under the [[Sharon Carter|Power Broker]] in Madripoor. He was interrogated by the [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]], the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], and [[Baron Zemo]], in his laboratory, where he was killed by the latter.\n\nDr. Nagel was created by Robert Morales and Kyle Baker.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier]]''====\nDr. Nagel is enlisted by [[HYDRA]]'s Winter Soldier program, to pick up their work, on recreating the [[Super Soldier Serum|super soldier serum]], after five failed test subjects in Siberia. When HYDRA falls, he is recruited by the CIA, who hold blood samples from [[Isaiah Bradley]]. With semi-stable traces of serum in his system, Nagel, after much labor, is able to isolate the necessary compounds in his blood, which allows him to recreate the serum, though it differs from the original, as the enhanced abilities, aren't needed with machinery, and the serum doesn't affect the physical aspect of the host. Before he can finish his work, Nagel falls victim to the [[Avengers: Infinity War|Blip]], an incident which see half of all life in the universe, wiped out. He [[Avengers: Endgame|returns, five years later]], and the program is abandoned, so he travels to Madripoor, where he works, under the Power Broker, who is happy to fund the recreation of his work. He creates twenty vials of the super soldier serum, but they are stolen by [[Karli Morgenthau]].\n\nDr. Nagel continues his work in a secret warehouse, when his base is infiltrated by [[Sam Wilson]], [[Bucky Barnes]] and [[Baron Zemo]]. They stop his music playing, which turns his attention to the three, and he questions who they are, and what they want. Sam confronts him, over creating the super soldier serum, but Nagel demands they leave his lab. He tries to exit, but the Winter Soldier, guards the exit, and his attention is brought to Baron Zemo, who is also present. They demand answers from him, but Dr. Nagel wants something in exchange for any information he gives. The Winter Soldier points a gun at his head, in response, and shoots it, inches besides him, as a threat. Dr. Nagel gives in, and reveals his how he was brought in by HYDRA and the CIA to recreate the serum, and compares himself to a god, managing to do, what no other scientist since [[Abraham Erskine|Erskine]] could, though his version is more subtle and optimized. Sam questions why they never heard of him, and Nagel discloses that during the Blip, he was one of the vanished, and wasn't able to complete his work, until he returned, under the employment of the Power Broker. He continues, to say that he created twenty, which were stolen by Karli Morgenthau, and pities her, as he imagines, what kind of punishment she will endure, at the hands of the Power Broker. Sam questions where Karli is presently, but Nagel doesn't know, though he informs them that a few days ago, she called and asked if he could help someone named Donya Madani, who ended up dying of tuberculosis. Sam asks what happened to her, but Nagel doesn't know. The Winter Soldier asks if there's any serum in his laboratory, and Nagel glares him in response, so he drives the gun, further into his temple. Nagel denies possessing any, and a woman arrives, to tell the men, they're out of time. At that moment, Zemo shoots Nagel in the head, killing him.\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nagel, Doctor Wilfred}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Falcon and The Winter Soldier characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:HYDRA agents]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
