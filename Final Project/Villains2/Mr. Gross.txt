One day when he cut in front of [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] in the road, Oscar later yells at him, making the guy retaliate by smacking his face off like mud. Later, as Oscar came and said that their daughters are starting to get along, he was hoping they could set a good example, and then Gross calmly agrees that they have to do it for the kids. When he accidentally pounded Oscar flat down to the ground when trying to make amends with him, he sincerely apologized and Oscar forgave him.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* Gross may have a mental disability. Given his slow speech and misremembering of how he cut Oscar off in traffic the other way around. It's possible he may be on the autism spectrum, which would explain his poorly processed responses.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\ngross1.png|\"You cut me off today.\"\ngross2.png\ngross3.png\ngross4.png|\"My bad.\"\nmrgrosscameo.png\ngrosslacienega.png\nMrandmrsgross.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gross, Mr.}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
