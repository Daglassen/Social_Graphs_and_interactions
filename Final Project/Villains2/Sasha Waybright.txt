Mm, I wonder if those gems are real.|Sasha before the beginning of the series |Reunion (Amphibia) }}\n'''Sasha Waybright''' is a major recurring character and former antagonist of the [[2019]] [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Amphibia]]''. She is a 13-year-old girl and the childhood friend of [[Anne Boonchuy]] and [[Marcy Wu]]. When the three are teleported to the world of [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] through the magic of a [[Calamity Box|music box]], Sasha becomes a prisoner of [[Toad Tower]], where she rises through the ranks to become first lieutenant to [[Captain Grime]]. She represents the rhinestone, or the pink quartz of strength on the [[Calamity Box]].\n\n==Background==\nSasha is a cheerleader and also has been friends with [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] and [[Marcy Wu|Marcy]] ever since kindergarten. Sasha first met Anne and Marcy when two older girls bullied them off a swing set. Seeing that they were too timid to stand up for themselves, Sasha stood up for them and immediately tried to force the girls to leave. Though they easily evaded her attacks, Sasha's unwillingness to give up caused them to leave and she has been friends with Anne and Marcy ever since.\n\nWhile Sasha does care about Anne and Marcy, she would often boss them around and made them do things they weren't comfortable doing. During Anne's 13th birthday, Sasha managed to encourage her to ditch school, so they could have some actual fun when after receiving a text from Marcy about a [[Calamity Box|strange box]] as a mocking present which would force Anne on having to miss her birthday party.\n\nShe was teleported to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] along with her friends, Anne & Marcy after they stole and opened the Calamity Box and had somehow got captured by [[Captain Grime]] and his toad army but Sasha quickly earned the trust of toads and became Grimes' second in command.\n\nAfter seeing the atrocities of the tyrannical [[King Andrias]] and realizing that her terrible behavior was hurting her friends she reforms and starts a rebellion against the mad newt king.\n\n===Personality===\n[[File:Toadcatcher (255).png|thumb|left|250px|Sasha prepared for battle.]]\nSasha is a rather charismatic girl as she is able to make friends so easily with anyone, even amphibians. Sasha has proven herself to be a fierce warrior and is seen to enjoy fighting; she also takes great pride in her strength as shown in the third temple. In addition, Sasha doesn\u2019t give up on anything, which can come as a good thing, but it also can be her downfall as this trait does cause problems to those around her, especially her friends. While outwardly nice and friendly, Sasha was actually manipulative, cunning, cold, selfish, quick tempered and power-hungry. Sasha would do anything to get what she wants, especially power, as she would come up a plan and scheme to lie, trick or backstab anyone to get it, which ends up hurting those around her. Despite her selfish, manipulating and power-hungry characteristics, Sasha would never do something if it meant being separated from her family or life as she was disgusted and hurt that Marcy not only tricked her alongside Anne into taking the box then stranding them in Amphibia on purposes but also for taking them away from everything they had, such as their homes, families, friends and lives.\n\nSasha likes being in control as this behavior extends to her friendship with Anne and Marcy. Also, Sasha would bully them, especially Anne, by convincing them into doing things that they don't want to do, such as skipping a school play rehearsal to go hang out on the roof, talking Anne into ditching school and her family on her birthday. Sasha seems to enjoy bossing Anne and Marcy around as she disliked when they undermine her authority, as shown when she became angry and hurt that there trying to find a way home without her input. Once Anne stood up to her and Marcy has shown in becoming more independent, Sasha became determined to put them back under her control at all cost.\n\n[[File:Sasha bcak with the group S2.PNG|thumb|250px|Sasha with Anne and Marcy.]]\nHowever, Sasha does genuinely care about Anne and Marcy as she doesn't like seeing them get bullied or hurt. In \"[[Prison Break]]\", Sasha's main goal was to find Anne and Marcy before finding a way to get home. Also, Sasha gets concern for Anne and Marcy's safety, which shows that she is afraid that something bad would happen to them if she wasn't there to protect them. However, upon seeing Anne again [[Anne of the Year|outside of Wartwood]], Sasha was excited to see her and was relived that she was alright. Also, upon reuniting with Marcy at [[The Third Temple]], Sasha was happy to see her and was safe. Sasha would choose Anne and Marcy's safety over her own, as shown in \"[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]\", after seeing Anne was gonna fall with her when she tried to help her get back up at [[Toad Tower]], but lets go of her hand just so she wouldn't be put endanger. This was shown again in \"[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]\", when Sasha hold off [[King Andrias|King Andrias]] just so Anne and Marcy can escape, even if it meant sacrificing her one chance to get home, but only Anne made it while Marcy didn't. After escaping King Andrias, Sasha hopes that Anne and Marcy are alright, due to witnessing the portal close with no idea if Anne made it home or not while Marcy got wounded and captured by the mad king. \n\nAlthough she didn't care about the inhabitants of Amphibia, at first, and sees them as gross amphibians, Sasha ends up forming a friendship with Grime, [[Percy (Amphibia)|Percy]], and [[Braddock]] as she comes to care for them, which changed her opinion. Ever since the events at Toad Tower, Sasha has shown to feel guilty for her past actions and how she treated her friends, especially Anne. However, Sasha's guilt for her past actions became worse when she put her friends Percy and Braddock in horrible danger just so she alongside Grime can get supporters for their rebellion. After Percy and Braddock left, Sasha not only became regretful of putting the only other friends beside Grime in terrible danger like that and should've taken them out of harms way first before going further but also begins to question her ideals. This doubt and remorse is shown again after successfully regaining Anne's trust so she and Grime can put their invasion plan in motion as Sasha became torn in her loyalties between her friends. Despite the invasion plan, Sasha truly made an honest effort in becoming a better friend to Anne and Marcy. Also, during her time with them, Sasha does see that Anne and Marcy have changed a great deal during their time in Amphibia. In addition, Sasha does come to understand that even though her human friends aren't the same people she has come to know doesn't' mean they're not the same people she cares about.\n\n[[File:True Colors Sasha relcets on her actions.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Sasha reflects on her actions.]]\nDespite not wanting to change herself like Anne and Marcy have, Sasha does take [[Toadie (Amphibia)|Toadie's]] advice into consideration as she realized that she doesn\u2019t have to be in control all the time and being supportive or giving others a chance to be in charge once in a while is more rewarding then controlling everything. However, in \"[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]],\" out of not accepting that her human friends have grown backbones, wanting control again and for various other petty reasons, Sasha goes through with Grime's plan anyway, which caused her friendship with Anne and Marcy to crumble. Although, while thinking about what Anne said when she called her out for her actions, Sasha questions what she truly wants and was unsure what to do for herself, even when Grime cheered her up. However, after discovering King Andrias true intentions, Sasha realized what she could have become if she didn't take Anne's harsh words to the heart and decides to focus her efforts in stopping him. Sasha also becomes a true friend as she fights by Anne's side in order to stop Andrias in going through with his plans, even fending off [[Frog-Bot Army|Frog-Bot army]]. \n\nAfter failing to stop King Andrias and retreated to Wartwood, Sasha went along with Grime's lie towards the citizens of the town so they can lay low. However, Sasha became guilty for lying to the citizens of Wartwood as they been nice to her and they kept reminding her of Anne, which overwhelmed her because of how she lied and hurt her. Sasha also blames herself for Marcy getting injured and captured by King Andrias, although she still upset with her for sending her and Anne to Amphibia in the first place but does understand that she never meant to cause serious harm towards them. Seeing the consequences of her actions, Sasha not only realized that she doesn't want power anymore but also had enough of making plans and schemes just to get it. After Grime encouraged her to enter the Plantar home, due to hesitating before, Sasha was convinced to do so as she finds Anne\u2019s journal then reads the day before they arrived to Newtopia. Seeing what Anne said about her and realizing that their friendship truly did mattered, Sasha breaks down and realized what she threw away just so she can be in control again.\n\n[[File:Sasha swearing to protect everyone.png|thumb|250x250px|Sasha vows to protect the citizens of Wartwood from King Andrias.]]\nThrough with her controlling, cunning, lying, manipulating and selfish characteristics, Sasha not only decided to become a better person but also find a way to set things right with her friends, especially Anne, and rescue Marcy from King Andrias. Sasha also decided to be honest with the citizens of Wartwood as she explains everything and promises to protect them at all cost. However, much to her surprise, Sasha was easily forgiven by the citizens of Wartwood as she not only told them the truth and faced the consequences of her actions but they were also impressed for how she took on King Andrias' robots just to protect them. Through those events, Sasha becomes Wartwood's newest protector in Anne's absences and inspires her newfound friends alongside Grime to fight back against King Andrias.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSasha is a medium height teenage girl with a slender build, fair skin, long blonde hair that tied back into a high ponytail, and has a beauty mark under her left eye.\n\nAfter her duel with Anne at Toad Tower, she now has a scar on her right cheek.\n\n==== Clothing ====\nWhen she initially comes to Amphibia, she wears her schoolgirl uniform.

Her new cloak and pauldron on her right shoulder has an eye like symbol painted on them by [[Percy (Amphibia)|Percy]]; she also has a smaller shoulder pad on her left shoulder.\n\n=== Powers and Abilities ===\n==== Powers ====\n*'''Power of the Pink Gem:''' First seen in \"[[Barrel's Warhammer]]\", the Calamity Box has given her the power of strength, evidenced by her eyes glowing pink like her gem. She likely lost her power in \"[[The Third Temple]]\" when the gem got recharged.\n\n==== Abilities ====\n* '''Psychological Warfare:''' Sasha is persuasive, manipulative and deceptive being able get others to do what she wants.

Ever since, Sasha has used the sword as her primary weapon of choice. Throughout time, Grime and Sasha's friendship developed more than just for using one another for their own games and after helping Grime raise a rebellion, take over Newtopia and overthrow King Andrias, Grime decided to give her another sword as a gift, hence her silver sword.\n* '''Dagger'''\n\n== Role in the series ==\n=== Before ===\n[[File:The Third Temple - The First Met.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sasha meeting Anne and Marcy as children.]]\nAs a child, Sasha was playing in a playground when she noticed [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] and [[Marcy Wu|Marcy]] being bullied by two teenage girls, and she stood up for them, who ended up being enamored by her bravery. Although her attempts to defend them were to no avail, the teenagers got annoyed by her and decided to leave. Anne and Marcy, who were impressed by her for helping them, introduced themselves to her, and she subsequently befriended them.\n\nSince then, Sasha, Anne and Marcy have been friends for a long time, but things were not as great as they seem; Sasha made Anne and possibly Marcy do things that made them had uneasy feelings about, inscribing fear into her friends, especially if they undermined her authority. At some point, they stared a band.\n[[File:Sasha thumbs up.jpg|thumb|250px|Sasha making Anne steal the [[Calamity Box|music box.]]]]\nBefore the start of the series, Sasha made Anne ditch school for her birthday as they spend the day playing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution Dance Dance Revolution] at the arcade. Sasha also stole money from the machine, ride a shopping cart, doing graffiti and chilling out in a caf\u00e9. Just as Anne is about to head home, Sasha convinced her to go see Marcy about getting a [[Calamity Box|mysterious music box]] as a present, but they were both unaware that their friend planned to run away from her parents because they were moving and knew something about the box. While Anne was inside of a Thrift shop, Sasha signals her to steal the box while the cashier lady is sleeping. After Anne slips it into her backpack and walks out the shop, they regrouped at a nearby park with no one else in sight to take a better look at the box. Once Anne opens the box, a large spark of light can be seen coming out of it and then Sasha finds herself in the world of [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]], separated from Anne and Marcy. At some point, Sasha was captured by the toad army and was taken to [[Toad Tower]].\n\n=== Season One ===\nIn the Toad Tower, [[Captain Grime]] is seen in front of a cell room and shows Sasha, currently in a battered cell, a lost shoe belonging to Anne that was found far from the castle in the south forest. This leads him to believe that not only was she lying to him, but that there is more of her kind still out there somewhere in Amphibia.\n\nDuring her time imprisoned at the tower, Sasha convinced serval toads into quit their jobs. They eventually find out two giant herons were nearing toad tower. The herons then start to instantly attack, the toads take shelter with Grime being upset, because the toads are not doing anything, too scared of the herons. Sasha gives Grime advice to compliment the toads instead of saying rude things to them. Grime then starts complimenting the toads and the toads instantly decide to attack the herons. The toads get rid of the herons and the toads go to have a grand feast. Grime then offer his he to be his second in command witch she accepts. Sasha then pulls out a picture of her with her friends promising to find them but also decide to have some \"fun\" with this world.\n\nAfter spending  much time helping Grime leading the toads in the valley Sasha goes to [[Wartwood Swamp|Wartwood]] and has [[Toadie (Amphibia)|Toadie]] bring Anne to the bridge out of town were she reveals herself to a surprised Anne. The two scream in delight and hug as Anne says how much she missed her. Sasha is overjoyed as well and then introduces Captain Grime and his toad army who then emerge from the darkness.\n\n[[File:Sasha_Waybright_defat_reunion.PNG|thumb|250px|A defeated Sasha realizes she can longer no control Anne.|left]]\nGrime and his army enter Wartwood to invite the frogs to a banquet celebrating Anne and Sasha's reunion. After Anne gives the okay, they head to Toad Tower. While the frogs enjoy the banquet, Anne and Sasha hang out in Sasha's room. Sasha tells Anne that the banquet was to get [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]] to the tower so he can be fed to a giant Venus flytrap for inspiring rebellions in the valley. Anne tries to rescue the frogs, but they are all captured. As Hop Pop is taken to be executed, Anne tries to get Sasha to free them, but she tries to once again manipulate Anne again like she did on earth and almost succeeds, but after seeing this an angry [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] throws mud at Sasha, denounces her as a bully, and encourages Anne. Angered by this defiance, Sasha tries to kill Sprig, but Anne intervenes, standing up to her at long last. Grime proposes a duel between the girls: if Anne wins the frogs can go, but if Sasha wins Hop Pop is to die. After an intense battle, Anne manages to defeat her by thrusting her sword into Sasha's, knocking her down and causing her to drop her sword and dagger, resulting in a cut on Sasha's face. Anne stands over her and states that she is not going to let Sasha push her around anymore, which stuns Sasha. Grime dose not keep is word and tries to kill Hop Pop anyway. It was then the tower starts to explode from [[One-Eyed Wally|One-Eyed Wally's]] boomshrooms. As everyone escapes the collapsing tower, Anne tries to save Sasha, but she lets herself fall out of guilt for how she treated her and to prevent Anne from falling as well. Grime saves Sasha, and he and the toads escape with her unconscious body.\n\n=== Season Two ===\n[[File:Sasha vow to settle the score with Anne.png|thumb|250px|Sasha vows to settle the score with Anne.]]\nWhile helping Grime hide from the law after Toad Tower collapsed, Sasha is rigorously training and pushing herself for revenge against Anne and the Plantars using dummies of them. She then tries to motivate Grime by having  [[Percy (Amphibia)|Percy]] and [[Braddock]] pose as bounty hunters and attacks them but this ends in failure. When [[General Yunnan]] comes for Grime they try escaping into the woods. While they were fleeing Grime pointed out that the real reason that Sasha is training so hard because she is trying to distract herself with fact that Anne stood up to her and nothing between them will be the same again. After nearly falling off a cliff, Sasha admits he's right and reveals the second reason for her training was so she would not lose Grime too because she now sees him as her only friend she has left, witch takes Grime aback and together they defeat Yunnan. Grime now motivated at last decides to raise a new army and attack [[Newtopia]]; Sasha looks to the horizon as she caressed the scar Anne gave her on her cheek, promising that she and Anne are not through with their quarrel.\n\n[[File:Barrel's Warhammer-01198.png|left|thumb|250px|A guilt ridden Sasha, after she drove [[Percy (Amphibia)|Percy]] and [[Braddock]] away with her neglect.]]\nGrime, Sasha, Percy and Braddock arrive at the north tower to get support for their rebellion. While the toad lords love the idea, Captain Bufo tells them that they are not on board with following a fugitive and a human. When Sasha learns from Grime\u2019s sister Captain Beatrix that Anne and Marcy are working together with [[King Andrias]], she flies in a rage and defeats all the toads that try to arrest her group and demands to know what would it take for the toads to follow them. It is then Captain Aldo gives the group the proposal of retrieving the legendary warhammer of Barrel the Brave. Sasha accepts the challenge and her group set off. Percy and Braddock are scared because of the beast that guarded the weapon, so Sasha tells them to give her a signal if the things get too intense for them, but when the beast attacks and they give the signal she instead ignores them and drives the creature towards the tower. In the end, it is Sasha\u2019s frustration from the thought of Anne and Marcy moving on without her causes her to pull the warhammer out of the monster\u2019s head; the warhammer starts to glow and knocks out the savage wild animal. With the quest completed, Sasha and Grime get the full support of the 3 toad armies. However, Percy and Braddock leave because they no longer want to work with Sasha who put their lives in danger for her own gain. Sasha tries to stop them only for Grime, who tells her that they have reached their limit, to stop her. Even though she is victorious that day, she is saddened by the fact she has lost her two toad friends.\n\n[[File:The Third Temple-01211.png|thumb|Sasha regains Anne's trust.|250px]]\nSasha and Grime track Anne and Marcy down at a temple in a volcano and saves them from some lava worms. Marcy is very excited to see her other human friend, but Anne is concerned. Sasha says the only reason they stalked them into the temple was to tell Anne that she is sorry for everything that went down at Toad Tower and that it was all her fault and wrong of her to put her frog friends in danger and for pushing her around and bullying her. Hop Pop is skeptical, and Sasha explains that she and Grime had to go into hiding and lost everything after the toad tower incident and she had a lot of time to think; she then asks what they were even doing in here, so Marcy explains their quest to recharge the 3 gem stones of the [[Calamity Box|calamity box]] and that this is the third and finale temple. Sasha is surprised at the aspect of a real way home and when Macy explains that each temple has a theme for their trials and this one is strength, Sasha is confident that she is the right person for the job and they press onwards. The group reaches the final trial witch is a giant stone toad monster that can increase the gravity in the room, and all the amphibians are too weak to try and get closer, and Marcy\u2019s outfit is too heavy. Sasha and Anne get closer and closer to the creature, Sasha tells Anne that she can tell that she still doesn't trust her even after she apologized. Anne then points out that it wasn't just the Toad Tower indecent; the fact was that Sasha had pushed her around her whole life and Sasha to her great shame admits she was right, much to Anne's surprise. When it seemed hopeless Anne gives the motivational speech Sasha needs, and says she still trusts her despite all that has happened. Sasha manages to remove her cloak, pauldron and boots; decreasing her weight enough to fight in the intense gravity and destroys the creature, and Anne lets her charge the third and final stone so they can all make it back home. Marcy stops them from opening the box and suggests they take it back to King Andrias so they can use it correctly. As they leave, Sasha thanks Anne for believing in her and Anne suggests that they have a fresh start, which makes Sasha happy. After they are left alone Grime makes sure that Sasha hasn\u2019t forgotten the plan to use her friends as a way to get into Newtopia. Sasha says they bought her act hook line and sinker, but also shows signs of genuine guilt of what might happen to Anne and Marcy.\n\n[[File:Chocolate Covered Hornets from Amphibia S2E19A.png|thumb|A great desert after an intense battle.|left|250px]]\n[[Felicia Sundew]] rented a spare room to her and Grime for their stay in Wartwood. When Anne invited her to dinner at the Planters\u2019 farm Grime reminded her to keep up the nice act for the plan to work; Sasha is confident that she can keep Anne and Marcy in the palm of her hands and once they conquer amphibia she can get her friendship with the girls under control once again. As they arrived Anne, Sasha and Marcy are all elated to be together again. During dinner she was actually impressed by Hop Pop\u2019s cooking, then she and the girls reminisce about the time they skipped theater rehearsal to throw a wild party on the school roof, but things got awkward for Sasha when she was reminded that Anne took the blame and got punished when they got caught. When they were playing a game of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary drawsidoodle] the Planters get on her nerves when they keep reminded her of the Toad Tower incident with turns into a heated argument with Anne. Just then the Vol-cake-no Grime brought over grows to epic proportions and hot chocolate lava comes pouring out everywhere. Grime explains that toads have a grand battle during desert just he was paralyzed by giant hornets that started flying out of the cake. As the hornets began swarming all around everyone, the human girls work together when they discovered they can penetrate the insects' hard exoskeletons with their own stingers. After they defeat the hornets and toss them all the chocolate just before it hardens, Sasha apologizes and explains she is not sure she wants to change because she likes the way she is. Anne tells Sasha that while she knows it is difficult for her to change, she needs to accept the fact that Anne has done so. Sasha does see the truth in what Anne is saying and hugs her. Grime comes to and offers everyone to try the chocolate covered hornets and find that they are quite delicious.\n\n[[File:Amphibia Band back togher.png|thumb|250px|Sasha being supportive of Anne in the Battle of the Bands.]]\n[[Mayor Toadstool]] holds a Battle of the Bands contest and the girls get together to reform Sasha and the Sharps. However, Sasha shows her controlling nature when Anne suggests a new song and she leaves in a huff. She tries forming a band with Toadie, but she later realizes that Toadie has no opinions for himself and it is actually exhausting always being in control. When Toadie points out that sometimes it's actually fun to support someone who you really care about, Sasha decides to join with Anne and Marcy and play Anne\u2019s song. After the contest which Grime won thanks to his 3 hour harp solo, Anne suggests taking a group photo before she, Marcy, and Sasha leave for home, to which everyone in Wartwood joins in.\n\n[[File:The Dark Truth of Andrias Leviathan.png|left|thumb|250px|Sasha and Grime learn the dark truth of King Andrias.]]\nAfter the group reached Newtopia, Sasha and Grime put their hoods up due to Grime's criminal status And Marcy promised to to get the king to pardon them. Just as Anne was about hand the music box over to Andrias, Sasha and Grime made their move and stole the music box. Sasha threaten to destroy the music box; Andrias reminded her that the music box was her only way home, but Sasha explained that she's not sure she wants to go home especially when she can rule an actual kingdom instead of some middle school. With Andrias distracted with Sasha, Grime was able to incapacitate the giant newt king with Barrel's Warhammer. Now that Andrias was locked up and the hidden toad soldiers were reeking havoc, the city gates were now open for the rest of the toad army that would be arriving within the hour. Sasha continued to act cordial towards Anne and Marcy and even offered them to join her, but Anne refused, calling her a horrible person and that she was done being friends with her. With that Sasha tried to send Anne back to earth to separate her from her surrogate frog family forever but couldn't' figure out how to get the box to work, so she ordered the guards to send Anne to the dungeon until she could, along with Marcy, the Planters, [[Lady Olivia]] and [[Frobo]]. While hanging out in the throne room Grime gave her a gift; a second sword so she could duel wield. Sasha was overjoyed, but when she looked at her reflection in the blade she was saddened as she began to wonder if Anne was right about her and is not sure what she wants anymore. Grime tried to cheer her up by helping her redecorate the [[Newtopia Castle|castle]], but when they tore down a tapestry they found a mural under it showing the king using the box for destructive purposes, making Sasha and Grime realize that Andrias may not be the benevolent ruler he appears to be. Just then they see that Anne and the others have escaped and go to stop Anne from closing the gate. Sasha tries to warn Anne about Andrias, but Anne is understandably still furious with her and attacks her. Anne manages to defeat her by pulling her own cape over her face.\n\n[[File:Sasha Waybright Real Reform.png|thumb|250px|Sasha becomes a true friend at long last.]]\nAfter the toad invasion failed Sasha and Grime were brought before the king with their hands bound in rope. Sasha once again tried to warn Anne only for Yunan cover her mouth with her tail. When Anne gave Andrias the box he told everyone present about a time when he was betrayed by his [[Unknown Female Frog|best]] [[Unknown Toad Warrior|friends]], that the music box was stolen from him  and no one remembers what Amphibia was like 1,000 years ago, but now that he got the box back he will use it's power to restore Newtopia to glory. Andrias used the box to power up his castle; enabling it to fly, then he reactivated ancient factories that created a [[Frog-Bot Army|massive robot army]] that arrived at the castle within moments. Andrias revealed that he was planning on invading other worlds starting with earth. When Anne and Sasha told the king they would stop him, he decides to show them a sample of his power by using his castles' giant laser cannon to destroy a nearby toad tower. Andrias shocked Anne and Sasha by divulging the truth that Marcy got the human girls stranded in Amphibia on purpose. Marcy then explained that on Anne's birthday her father told her he got a new job out of state and they were moving away and that she learned of the music box before hand; she wanted to use it to take the 3 of them to a world were they could be together forever, then Marcy fell to her knees with her remorse. Anne vows to stop Andrias and Sasha finally decides to do the right thing and fights by her side; Grime also joins the battle. When the king threw Sprig out the window Sasha watched as the grief it caused Anne to awaken the power of the blue gem stone within her and was amazed by the new abilities she wielded as she destroyed many frog bots and beat Andrias to the floor. When Marcy saved Sprig and used the music box to open the portal to earth, Sasha and Grime held off Andrias while Anne and the Planters fled into the portal but the portal closed before she could flee as well thanks to Andrias driving his laser sword though Marcy.\n\n===Season Three===\n[[File:Turning point Still.jpeg|thumb|left|250x250px|Sasha and Grime witnessing Marcy getting stabbed by King Andrais.]]\nSasha is heartbroken to see Marcy on the floor wounded but is told by Grime they can't help her now. As Andrais has Marcy taken to a healing chamber, Sasha and Grime jump out the window as they escape on Joe Sparrow. They decide to return to Wartwood to hide as they realized that it would be one of the few places King Andrias would go looking for them. After Grime tells the citizens of Wartwood the truth about the king being the corrupt monarch he really is and has \"unspeakable power\", Sasha goes along with his lie as he tells them that Anne and the Plantars were on an important mission and sent them to protect the town. The two decided to go to the Plantar Farm to rest for the night but Sasha is hesitant to sleep in the same house of the friend she betrayed yet again so she decides to sleep in the barn. Sasha is riddled with even more guilt when the townsfolk treat her with kindness and reminded her of Anne. Sasha listens when Grime informs her that some of the Toad Army managed to eluded capture.
