When he discovered her fleur-de-lis brand, which is meant for execution, he gave her to the authorities. Unknown to him, she escaped and married Count de Winter, later killing the man. She was saved from execution by [[Cardinal Richelieu]]\u00a0and became one of his spies and assassins. \n\nShe is ordered by Cardinal Richelieu to travel to England to engineer an alliance with the Duke of Buckingham. On her way, she kidnaps [[D'Artagnan]], but is confronted by the Three Musketeers. Her treachery revealed, she is jailed by the musketeers and her brother-in-law, Lord Armand de Winter. \n\n[[Athos]] tries to gain information from the woman but is refused. That morning, the party and a swordsman take her to a cliff for her execution. In a dramatic change from the novel's source, it is Athos who saves Milady from beheading, begging forgiveness for betrayal. Moved by this, Sabine forgives Athos, tells all\u00a0Cardinal's plans, and then\u00a0commits suicide by jumping off a cliff.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nmiladyplan.jpg|Milady revealing [[Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal]]'s plan to [[Athos]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Three Musketeers}}\n[[Category:The Three Musketeers characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
