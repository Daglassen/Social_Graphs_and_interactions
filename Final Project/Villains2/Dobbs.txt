Allegedly, he was formerly a millionaire via stock markets, but lost it all sometime later, which acted as motivation for his stealing lunch money from other students. Later, Max stole his handheld computer device and gave it to the [[Evil Ice Cream Man]] while he left the latter's metal coil on Dobbs' porch while he received an email about his device. Dobbs went to the junkyard, met up with the Evil Ice Cream Man, and they demanded each other to give their own devices back. They each destroyed the devices and got into a fight while Max picked up the ice cream truck with a giant claw vehicle and dumped gallons of melted ice cream onto them. When he apparently moved out, he then attempted to do massive extortions on his schoolmates as settlement for not being able to target Max directly. After Max makes clear he hasn't moved, he, wanting revenge after realizing that Max (with strong courage) has not moved to [[Chicago]], he partners with [[Troy McGinty]] and they fight him in the school parking lot. However, the students finally get back at them and throw them in the dumpster (with Max's, albeit unintentional, permission, since he advocated letting them go free to avoid becoming like them).\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Max is planning his striking back against the bullies, a flashback shows [[Megan]] telling Dobbs in a slightly sarcastic manner, \"I keep my money in a piggy bank, it looks like you,\" with him then flashing a smile. This was taken from a deleted scene in the movie, in which Dobbs attempts to extort Megan of her money near her locker, only for her to sarcastically refuse, resulting in him stealing her clarinet as \"compensation.\"\n*His leitmotif is \"If Everybody Looked the Same\".\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Max Keeble's Big Move characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
