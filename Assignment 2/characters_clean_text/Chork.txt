Chork is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Chork is a worker at the Tabantha Bridge Stable. He spends his mornings drinking at the table inside. In the afternoons, he takes care of the White Goats outside the Stable.
When Link first speaks to Chork, he mentions an altar at Washa's Bluff, south of the Stable. Previously, he checked the platform out with Geggle, but neither of them could figure it out. If spoken to again, he will tell Link that a Rito Bard flew to Washa's Bluff to observe it himself.
Link can return to Chork after completing the "Under a Red Moon" Shrine Quest. Chork is surprised to hear an Ancient Shrine was hidden by the platform. Now, he decides to solve the mystery of the Shrine. He mutters to himself about how the Shrine only deepens the mystery.
