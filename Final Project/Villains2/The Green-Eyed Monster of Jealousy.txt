Monster Esq.}}'''The Green-Eyed Monster of Jealousy''', or '''G.I. Monster Esq.''', is a wolf-like monster and the main villain from the ''[[Quack Pack]]'' episode, \"[[Snow Place to Hide]]\".\n\n==Role in the Episode==\nThe Green-Eyed Monster of Jealousy first appears out of nowhere after [[Donald Duck|Donald]] says good-bye to [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] for her ski business trip. Throughout the episode, because of Donald's jealousy, he tries to convince Donald into thinking Daisy is having another boyfriend(s) in her life behind his back like [[Kent Powers]] and Jean-Claude, therefore, making Donald grow more jealous and angrier and making him find ways to stop it from happening without being seen; even with the help of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|his nephews]]. In the end, everything backfires and both Donald and the Monster end up in the hospital. Donald realizes he was wrong to be jealous, Daisy forgives him and still admits her love to him, and the Monster gets himself trapped in the hospital bed by Donald in retaliation for all the lies and trouble he caused for him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Donald also got a Green-Eyed Monster in the [[Carl Barks]]' comic story ''The Master Rainmaker'', but the one in ''Quack Pack'' is unlikely based on the comic book one, who looked more devil-like.\n*The Monster's clothes bear a striking resemblance to [[Toon Patrol|Greasy]]'s clothes from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nSnow Place to Hide1.jpg|The G.E.M.'s eyes\nSPTH1.jpg\nSnow Place to Hide2.jpg|The G.E.M.'s card\nSnow Place to Hide3.jpg\nSPTH2.jpg\nSPTH3.jpg\nSPTH4.jpg\nSPTH5.jpg\nSPTH6.jpg\nSPTH7.jpg|The G.E.M.'s defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Quack Pack}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green-Eyed Monster of Jealousy, The}}\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
