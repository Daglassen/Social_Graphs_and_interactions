He wanted to know why Arthur was doing this, who told him that Larry was playing like a one-man team, with Buck replying that he\u00a0was\u00a0the team. Not being able to take criticism, he told Larry that they were leaving and forced him to leave the Timberwolves and moved the entire family to Spokane just so Larry could play for the\u00a0Warriors. He was upset that they lost the championship.\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Teachers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
