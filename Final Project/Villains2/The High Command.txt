It seems that throughout the entire series, they never left their certain area (possibly F.O.W.L. headquarters). Also, they were always hidden in the shadows and their true names were never mentioned during the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' series run at all.\n\nThe ones that usually talked were the duck in the middle with a big head and fangs, and the bird of prey with a hunched back. The bird of prey wearing the over sized hat never talked. It also appears that they were anthropomorphic birds.\n\nAll members of F.O.W.L. are shown to fear them, as they appear to be prone to violently dispose of those who upset them, including [[Steelbeak]]'s predecessor, who was put through six trash compactors.\n==Trivia==\n*In the 2017 reboot of ''DuckTales'', the leadership of F.O.W.L. is assumed by the [[Board of Directors]], who are also the financial advisors of McDuck Enterprises.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDarkwing-duck-omnibus-silvani-fa9c0.jpg\nDarkwing Duck Issue 10A textless.jpg\nDarkwing-fiendish foes.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:High Command}}\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Falcons]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"
