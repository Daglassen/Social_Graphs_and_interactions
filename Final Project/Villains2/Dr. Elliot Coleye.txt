Eventually, he tries to stop Martin and Neenert from taking off, but it was too late because they fly back to [[Mars]].\n\nEventually, Coleye consumes the piece of nerplex left by Neenert and he is turned into an alien too. While laughing at this, he accidentally swallows it, which presumably leaves him permanently in his transformation. He then ends up getting caught by his own organization and gets tranquillized off screen.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* His name is a pun on the bacteria E. coli, or [[wikipedia:Escherichia coli|Escherichia coli]], a notorious bacteria that causes severe illness in the lower intestines.\n{{Stub}}\n{{My Favorite Martian}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coleye, Dr. Elliot}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:My Favorite Martian characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]"
