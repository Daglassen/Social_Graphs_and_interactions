Billy is next seen when [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]], [[Monterey Jack|Monty]], and [[Zipper]] are searching for Chip and Dale. The two mice wake him up with the light of their submarine. Billy chases the three rangers and tries to catch them until Gadget closes the lid of a treasure chest on one of his tentacles. This causes him to be injured and he leaves the rangers alone.\n\nBilly is later seen when [[the Pi-Rats]] make the rescue rangers walk the plank. He catches the rodents, and Zipper flies close to him, which causes him to sneeze and let the rangers go. The rangers open a door at the ceiling and a pile of dump falls on Billy.\n\nBilly is last seen when the Pi-Rats' ship gets out of the water. Chip and Dale tie Billy on the crow's nest, and he is defeated.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBilly_squid.png\nBilly2.png\nBilly3.png\nBilly4.png\nBilly5.png\nBilly6.png\nBilly8.png\nBilly_defeat.png\ndwbilly.jpg|Billy the Squid as [[Neptunia]]'s octopus friend Hal in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode \"[[Something Fishy]]\"\ndwbilly2.jpg|Billy the Squid as an octopus in an aquarium in \"[[The Darkwing Squad]]\"\ndwbilly3.jpg|Billy as Hal in \"[[Just Us Justice Ducks]]\" (part 1)\ndwbilly4.jpg|Billy as Hal in \"[[Just Us Justice Ducks]]\" (part 2)\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Billy the Squid has appeared as [[Neptunia]]'s octopus friend Hal in some ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episodes.\n*His name is a pun on that of the famous outlaw Billy The Kid's\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Cephalopods]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
