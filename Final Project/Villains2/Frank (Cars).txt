He is very sensitive and gets angry, even at things that aren't worth it. He spends his days patrolling the tractor pastures and keeping everything in order, including keeping Mater out of the fields.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cars]]''===\n\"Frank is a hard worker, he spends his days in the fields harvesting, threshing and cleaning grain; then it's off to oversee the [[tractors]]' work for the rest of the afternoon. By the end of his long day Frank is ready to power down for the night and prepare for the early morning ahead. So if you're planning to wake Frank up out of his precious sleep you'd better have a good reason, or a really good escape route.\"<ref>\"Car Finder\" (supplementary material on Blu-ray Disc release of ''Cars''). 2007. Blu-ray Disc. Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2007.</ref>\n\nHe guards the tractors at night while they sleep, and attempts to get [[Mater]] and [[Lightning McQueen]] when he finds that they are tractor tipping.\n\nFrank has a minor role in ''Cars''. After Lightning McQueen and Mater woke him by scaring the tractors and tipping them, he chases them out of the field. He almost manages to get Lightning just before the two cars leave the pasture, where Frank cannot go past the wooden fence. Lightning later has a nightmare that he, [[The King (Cars)|The King]] and [[Chick Hicks]] are beaten by Frank who appeared out of nowhere in the tie-breaker race, with Chick Hicks not even surviving the race (Frank catches him, shreds him, and expels his remains from his unloading auger). At the end of Lightning's dream, Frank appears to be hanging out with the [[Dinoco]] racing team. Frank is not seen again for the rest of the film, but can be seen behind a fence with the tractors watching a drive-in movie (with all the other characters) during the end credits.\n\n===''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]''===\nFrank makes a cameo in ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'' sleeping in the field with the tractors, until Mater wakes him up by speeding in front of him with a blue lantern on his hook which he thinks was \"the Ghostlight\".\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Cars (video game)|Cars: The Video Game]]''===\nIn ''Cars: The Video Game'', he only appears in Tractor Tipping. He is one of the obstacles you must stay away from. If you get caught in his headlights or bump him, you automatically get caught. If you get caught, a scene will show where Frank will chase Lightning and Mater out of his field. You also get caught if you stay in a spotlight for too long or if you move close to Frank for too long.\n\n===''[[Cars Mater-National Championship]]''===\nHe also appears in ''Cars Mater-National Championship''. Basically, Frank has the same role that he did in ''Cars: The Video Game''. You tip tractors, and try to stay away from Frank. You'll also get caught if you go too fast on gravel for a long time. In the end scene for the last level, Frank finds Mater and Lightning and chases them before they are soon trapped between him and a fence. Lightning, however, uses a horn (which is strange because he didn't have one in the film and the prequel game; he just revved his engine), and Frank actually tips over. Lightning and Mater then laugh at this. This was the only time when Frank tips over like a tractor.\n\n===''[[Cars 2: The Video Game]]''===\nFrank is not seen in the actual film of ''[[Cars 2]]''. He does, however, reappear in ''Cars 2: The Video Game''. Mater mentions Frank to Jeff Gorvette, Carla Veloso and your character at the opening of the Canyon Race. Frank appears in almost all of the [[Radiator Springs]] levels. In races, Frank (who's behind a fence) roars at cars who race pass him. Frank also appears in most Hunter and Arena Modes. If you get too close to Frank, then he will fling you up in the air with his blades and cause damage to an agent.\n\n===''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney Pixar Adventure]]''===\nAlthough not making a physical appearance in ''Kinect Rush: A Disney Pixar Adventure'', he does appear as a wooden 2D model in the first ''Cars'' level Fancy Drivin'. It appears in a field part of the course when the player, Mater and [[Sheriff (Cars)|Sheriff]] go into the field. The edges of the shredders make ramps for jumping.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===''[[Radiator Springs Racers]]''===\nFrank makes an appearance in [[Cars Land]], in [[Radiator Springs Racers]]. Mater takes the vehicle tractor tipping, then they wake up Frank. He then chases away them, and you run away into Radiator Springs.\n\nThere is also a song called \"Big Bulldozer\", which is about Frank, that Mater sings at [[Mater's Junkyard Jamboree]]. That song is included in ''The Music of Cars Land''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFrank3.jpg\nFrank wake.png\nFrankCars.png\nFrank Cars Mater-National.PNG\nFrankCarsGame.PNG\nFrank Cars2VG.jpg|Frank in ''Cars 2: The Video Game'' as he appears during the opening of one of the Radiator Springs races.\nTipped Frank.png\nFrankworldofcars.jpg|Frank as he appears in ''[[The World of Cars Online]]''.\nFrank Chasing McQueen.jpg\nFrank1.jpg\nFrank at the Fence.jpg\nFrank Close Up.jpg\nFrank at Night.jpg\nFrank Cars.jpg\nFrank in the Race.jpg|Frank in Lighting's nightmare\nFrank Winning the Piston Cup.jpg\nTumblr n0b2u3ZVKP1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nScreen Shot 2020-12-30 at 8.03.12 AM.png|Frank enjoying a bit of ''A Bug's Life''\nCarsland Jacob-149.jpg|Frank in Radiator Springs Racers at Cars Land\nRor-frank-mega-size.jpg|Frank's die-cast.\nMega Size Frank 2.jpg|Final Lap Collection die-cast packaging\nTractor Tippin with frank.jpg|Frank in the Tractor Tippin' track set\nMegabloks Tipping Tractors.jpg|Mega blocks\nDisney Store Frank.jpg|Disney Store\nCars Frank Wheel Action Drivers.jpg\n71A0khhZpgL._AC_SX425_.jpg|Chase and Change Frank \n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Frank appears in ''[[Cars (video game)|Cars: The Video Game]]'' and ''[[Cars Mater-National Championship]]'' in all of the Tractor Tipping levels.\n*Frank is not seen in the actual film of ''[[Cars 2]]''. He does, however, reappear in ''[[Cars 2: The Video Game]]''.\n*Frank resembles a bull in both appearance and personality (such as an insignia on his front resembling a nose ring and his two smokestacks resembling horns). In ''[[El Materdor]]'', the bulls, however, are bulldozers.\n*According to Car Finder, Frank is an XXL Metroactual Combine. He also resembles a Case IH Axial-Flow 7010 Combine.\n*Frank was seen in [[Cars: Fast as Lightning]], only part of Mater's racetrack.\n*Frank did not appear in ''[[Cars 3]]'', but the tractors did.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|pixar|Frank (Cars)|Pixar Wiki}}\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/worldofcarsdrivein/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|worldofcarsdrivein|Frank (combine)|World of Cars Wiki}}\n\n{{PixarWiki}}\n{{Cars}}\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Cars characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]"
