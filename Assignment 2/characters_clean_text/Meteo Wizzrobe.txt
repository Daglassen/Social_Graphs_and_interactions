Meteo Wizzrobes are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Meteo Wizzrobes are a stronger variant of the Fire Wizzrobe. They attack by using their Meteor Rods to conjure 3 Fireballs as well as by summoning flaming monsters such as Fire Chuchus and Fire Keese. They are also able to increase the area's temperature, making it too hot for Link without heat-resistant Armor or Elixirs. The Meteo Wizzrobe, like other Wizzrobes, will become invisible after attacking, leaving ripples in the air with each footstep. Striking it in the head with an Arrow will stun it and give Link time to attack. Hitting it with an ice attack, such as with Ice Arrows or a Frostblade, will immediately evaporate the Wizzrobe. Upon defeat, Meteo Wizzrobes drop their Meteor Rod.
