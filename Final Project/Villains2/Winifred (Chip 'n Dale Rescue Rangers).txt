Reading these books, however, made her understand the basics of magic which allowed her to talk with animals, enchant items, and create sparks of energy. However, these powers were incredibly weak compared to an actual witch, so to become a real witch, she had to make a spell which required several items with the help of some animals named [[Bud (Chip 'n Dale)|Bud]], [[Lou (Chip 'n Dale)|Lou]], and [[Foxglove]] that she had made her familiars.\n\nWith the help of her assistants, Winifred was able to get the first few ingredients for her spell. But while obtaining one of the items, Foxglove encountered the Rescue Rangers and fell in love with Dale, causing her to be torn between sides. When Winifred found out the Rangers had the last item she needed, she captured Dale and Foxglove (who had finally turned on her). However, the other Rangers arrived, defeated Bud and Lou, and ruined the spell.\n\nWinifred was later arrested and is made a janitor at the prison.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Custodians]]"
