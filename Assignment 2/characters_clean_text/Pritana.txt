Pritana is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Pritana is a Gerudo who can be found in Gerudo Town. When talking with Nali in the center of the Town, Pritana says she cannot believe that Riju's Thunder Helm was stolen by thieves. Nali replies that the Thunder Helm is a helmet that was Lady Urbosa's favorite and explains that it has been passed from chief to chief for generations. Pritana feels sorry for Riju and Nali comments that she heard the thieves are professional assassins. Pritana reasons that this must be why the barracks have been more noisy lately.
If Link speaks to Pritana while she is not talking with Nali, she explains that she chats with Nali every day, but they never get tired of talking about the same things. Pritana feels like she could talk forever with her "vai friends." She also tells Link that the Gerudo Desert gets very cold at night, warning him that he will catch a cold or worse if he wears his Gerudo Set outside of the Town walls. Pritana recommends staying at the Hotel Oasis if Link does not have a warmer outfit, such as a Warm Doublet. Pritana will go home at certain times during the day, where she is found lying in bed muttering that she does not feel good. If approached when she gets out of bed and begins to leave, she will ask Link to be quiet, as she has a strong headache.
During the night, Pritana can be found inside The Noble Canteen. If Link speaks to her, she says that he looks too young to drink there and asks how old he is. If Link says he is over 100 in reference to his Slumber of Restoration, Pritana pauses and then begins to laugh, complimenting Link's sense of humor and asking him to drink with her when he gets older. If Link ends the conversation instead, Pritana reaffirms that the drinks in the Canteen are only for adults.
