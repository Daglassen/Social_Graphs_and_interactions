They are poachers who were working for [[Lyle Van de Groot]], who try to abduct [[Ape]].\n==Appearances==\n===''George of the Jungle''===\nIn the movie, Max and Thor are two poachers posing as trackers were hired by [[Lyle Van de Groot|Lyle]] who thinks that they are the best guides in the world to find [[Ursula Stanhope]]. Their goal was to find the white ape and kidnap it. The next day, Ursula was believed to be kidnapped by the white ape said Lyle, so this was their chance to capture it so Max told [[Mr. Kwame]] and his [[N'Dugo, Kip and Baleto|men]] he'll pay 50 zamoles a man if they help capture the white ape and bring him alive, the men agreed if only 100 zamoles a man which he's fine with. The next day, they finally found her and the white ape who really is a man named [[George of the Jungle (character)|George of the Jungle]].\nWhile they were waiting for Lyle, they saw [[Shep]], George's pet elephant, and they were going to shoot him then an ape named Ape stopped them and they were paused to hear him talk and shoot him with the tranquilizer gun but stopped when Lyle shot George. They and Lyle had to go to Bujumbura Jail but they were released, unlike Lyle. After that, their new goal was to kidnap Ape for using his skills in Las Vegas to have cash, room service, girls etc... and they believed nobody will stop them not even George.\nWhen they got back to Ape Mountain, their plan of Ape had succeeded and they locked him in a cage to leave Ape Mountain but had trouble leaving the place. Thor was getting frustrated as the trail they had taken was constantly leading them back to the treehouse. Ape tried to tell them that the trail they had been on was a fake, but while Thor was convinced as they had been down the trail many times, Max stubbornly thought that Ape was tricking them and they went on.\u00a0\nWhen they were back to the treehouse once again,\u00a0Thor lost his temper and argued with the Narrator then with Max, then out of nowhere, George came back to rescue Ape then it turned into a fight, in which the two assaulted George by twisting his nipples and tickle torturing him (though George seemed to like being tickled by them as he didn't try to escape). Despite outnumbering and overpowering George (especially when they tickled him), they were defeated by George, with the help from the jungle animals and Ursula, Ape was saved.\nLater on, when Lyle came back (after escaping from jail and becoming a minister of marriages), he and his minion of mercenaries [[Gunner, Scooter, Hobbs, Yon, and Phil|Gunner, Scooter, Hobbs, Yon and Phil]]\u00a0locked them, Ape, and George, until a bunch of apes appeared to save George and Ape but not them. Later, they and the mercenaries were trapped in that cage and\u00a0going to\u00a0get peed on\u00a0by Shep. In the last scene of the movie, Ape became famous in Vegas and their final fate was them being\u00a0dressed as\u00a0a prop tree during his show.\n\n===''George of the Jungle 2''===\nThey appear in a flashback of Lyle falling into the elephant dung as a reminder from the narrator to the audience of who Lyle is.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionsize=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMax.jpg|Max\n500px-thor-Win70-2-B.jpg|Thor\nLyle Van de Groot, Max, Thor.jpg|Lyle Van de Groot, Max, Thor\nThor, George, Max.jpg|Max and Thor vs George\nmax n thor.png|Max and Thor shocked seeing Ape talking.\nMax and thor pic.png|Max and Thor capturing Ape.\nGeorge-of-the-jungle-disneyscreencaps com-8899.jpg|Max and Thor tied to cage and get peed by Shep\nGeorge-of-the-jungle-disneyscreencaps com-9840.jpg|Max and Thor Defeat\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the original cartoon, George faced two poachers a couple of times named \"Tiger\" Titherage and \"Weevil\" Plumtree. Both were \"professional\" poachers that were always thwarted by George. It seems that Max and Thor are the spiritual successors to those two characters.\n* Max is Greg Cruttwell's final acting performance before retiring and becoming an English football associate consultant.\n\n{{George of the Jungle}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:George of the Jungle characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Poachers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
