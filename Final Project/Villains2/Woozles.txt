It is currently unknown if Woozles are bad or good creatures (like Hefflalumps) by [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] and his friends. In ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', Woozles are seen and often mentioned by [[Tigger]] throughout the series. The only known woozles to physically appear in any Winnie the Pooh related media are a villainous thief named [[Stan Woozle and Heff Heffalump|Stan]], and a giant named [[Wooster]]. While Stan fulfills the original idea that woozles are usually evil thieves who have much in common with honey-snatching heffalumps, Wooster proves they can be turned good, depending on the woozle's personality and how they are treated by others.\n\nIn ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]'', [[Darby]], Tigger, Pooh and the others leave out treats for some Woozles, although no Woozles are seen or come. However, at the end of the episode, all the treats are gone and presumably eaten by the Woozles (so they could be nice or gentle creatures). If\u00a0''The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh''\u00a0and\u00a0''My Friends Tigger\u00a0& Pooh'' are both\u00a0meant to fall within the same continuing storyline within the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' universe, this could mean that much like humans in real life, some choose to make good decisions (like Wooster), and others choose to make bad decisions (like Stan).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nWinniethepooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4409.jpg\nStan Shushing Heff.jpg\nSmk559391LARGE.jpeg|The Woozles' ''[[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]'' spell card\nSpotted woozle.jpg|One of the woozles that appears in ''Pooh's Party Game: In Search of the Treasure''.\nPurple Woozle.jpg\nYellow woozle.jpg\nScanned 1970-71 Winter.jpg\nHeffalumpandwoozle.jpg|The Woozles in a parade at one of the Disney Parks.\nWinnie-the-pooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4487.jpg\nWinnie-the-pooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4558.jpg\nwinnie-the-pooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4607.jpg\nWinnie-the-pooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4460.jpg\nWinnie-the-pooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4466.jpg\nwinnie-the-pooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4389.jpg\nwinnie-the-pooh-disneyscreencaps.com-4437.jpg\nWoozle POP.jpg\nDisney_Magic.jpg\nWinnie-the-pooh-and-the-blustery-day-pooh-heffealumps-and-woozles.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n\n[[ar:\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0632\u0648\u064a\u0644]]\n[[es:Wartas]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Weasels]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:My Friends Tigger and Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
