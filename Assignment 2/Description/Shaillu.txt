She sells every type of Arrow. Shaillu is always seen reading a book behind the shop's counter. When [[Link]] talks to her, her focus is broken from her book and she apologizes.<ref>{{Cite|...Oh... Oops, sorry... Vasaaq.|Shaillu|BotW}}</ref> Shaillu tells Link that if he is looking for something other than Arrows, he should look in Gerudo Town,<ref>{{Cite|I only sell arrows. They're on the counter to your left. If you're looking for something else, try {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}}.|Shaillu|BotW}}</ref> but quickly remembers that men are not allowed there.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, right... Voe aren't allowed in {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}}.|Shaillu|BotW}}</ref> If Link ends the conversation with Shaillu without asking for anything, she says that she is busy and asks Link to only speak to her if he needs something.<ref>{{Cite|I'm busy right now. Please only speak to me if you need something.|Shaillu|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Shaillu while wearing the [[Gerudo Set]], she comments that the clothes look good on him.<ref>{{Cite|...Those clothes... They look really good on you...|Shaillu|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Shaillu while searching for the [[Vilia|man]] who discovered a way into Gerudo Town, he asks Shaillu if she has seen a sneaky guy around. Shaillu is unable to recall someone of that description,<ref>{{Cite|A sneaky what? You mean a voe, sneaking around town? I haven't seen anyone like that.|Shaillu|BotW}}</ref> but does know of a [[Hylian]] girl who likes to relax on the roof.<ref>{{Cite|There's a {{Color|BotW Red|Hylian vai}} who likes to relax on the roof.
