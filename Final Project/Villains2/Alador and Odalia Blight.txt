They hold high standards for their children (although this is mainly on Odalia\u2019s part since she is the more authoritative one), and apparently have superseding authority.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nAlador is a middle-aged man with fair skin, pointy ears, messy brown hair, a faint mustache and goatee, thick eyebrows, and golden eyes. As an inventor, he wears a gray lab coat with a light gray belt, light gray shirt, white pants, and dark gray shoes. Due to working with Abominations, his outfit has pink and purple stains.\n\nOdalia is a middle-aged woman with pale skin, pointy ears, two-tone mint green hair in a bun, blue eyes and wears dark purple lipstick and black nail polish. She wears a purple blouse, a white vest with trios of intersecting pink crystal balls, dark teal pants, two-tone gray laced boots, golden earrings and a magenta amulet around her neck.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===Season One===\nThey first appeared as silhouettes in \"[[Understanding Willow]]\". After Amity accidentally setting [[Willow Park|Willow's]] memories on fire, she and Luz were forced to go into her mind to repair them. They encountered Willow's \"inner\" self, who wanted to attack Amity. Before she could finish her off, Amity revealed the truth as to why she ended her friendship with her. Her parents did not want her to continue being friends with Willow due to their desire of keeping up their reputation. They arranged for [[Boscha]] and Skara, children of their coworkers, to be her new friends, and threatened to ensure that Willow would never be able to attend [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]] if she did not end her friendship with her.\n\nThey're seen again in a flashback among the crowd watching [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] and [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]]'s witches duel in \"[[Young Blood, Old Souls]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Alador's name means destiny, luck, and more surprising facts. The name Alador evokes diplomacy, correctness, and confidence.\n*Odalia's name is originated from the Germanic name odalys, which means \"wealth\". This fits her, as the Blight family is very affluent.\n*According to a Reddit AMA hosted by [[Dana Terrace]], Mr. Blight has brown hair and shares this with Amity while Odalia's hair is green, the same as Emira and Edric's<ref name=\"hair\">[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOwlHouse/comments/ill21i/hooty_hooty_im_dana_terrace_creator_and_ep_of_the/g3symor/ Dana Terrace's AMA (September 2, 2020)]</ref>\n**The same comment also stated That Odalia had Amity dye her hair green because she likes her children to be \"color-coordinated\", implying that she might have a form of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nThe Owl House Mid Season Sneak Peek (25).png\nEscaping Expulsion (7).png\nEscaping Expulsion (24).png\nEscaping Expulsion (48).png\nEscaping Expulsion (49).png\nEscaping Expulsion (53).png\nEscaping Expulsion (69).png\nEscaping Expulsion (74).png\nEscaping Expulsion (97).png\nEscaping Expulsion (101).png\nBlights design concept 1 by Marina Gardner.jpg\nBlights design concept 2 by Marina Gardner.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:theowlhouse:Alador Blight|Alador Blight]] on [[w:c:theowlhouse|The Owl House Wiki]]\n*[[w:c:theowlhouse:Odalia Blight|Odalia Blight]] on [[w:c:theowlhouse|The Owl House Wiki]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{The Owl House}}\n[[Category:The Owl House characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]"
