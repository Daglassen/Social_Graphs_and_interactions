He is an insane Cajun trapper and swamp wizard who lived in the swamplands behind [[Norrisville High]].\n\n==Personality==\nCatfish Booray is tough and threatening. He likes having control over animals and is willing to do horrific things to people like trapping them and feeding them to his pets. He is extremely territorial and protective of \"his\" swamp.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCatfish can uses a magic purple powder, which he got from the \"Spirit of the Swamp,\" to control the animals of the swamp. The power can also transform him at his own will into a monster known as Pythanthigator. The usage of his powder also made his eyes glowed a purple color. After being exposed to a Chaos Pearl, Catfish was under The Sorcerer's control and have green eyes. He was also able to turn himself into a different monster, making him the only character to transform into a different monster without getting stanked.\n\n==Role in the [[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja|series]]==\nCatfish Booray first appeared in the episode \"[[Swampy Seconds]]\", When [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]] and [[Howard Weinerman|Howard]] entered the swamp looking for quicksand. Randy was captured and kidnapped by Catfish. However as he had had his ninja powers removed due to him abusing them he was trapped. Catfish took him to his home and threw him in a cage. Then upon discovering Howard was also trapped, he and his animal minions went to get him, leaving Randy imprisoned.\n\nUpon finding Howard, Catfish planned to make him into gumbo for his animals to eat. However, Randy (who had escaped) arrived and intervened. He seemingly died saving Howard, thus giving him back his Ninja powers. Catfish sent the animals after him, but Randy managed to free them by destroying Catfish's magic collars. Freeing Howard they ran, while Catfish summoned the powers of a swamp turning himself into a giant monster. He attacked Randy and was about to kill him when Howard tossed a cinder block at him knocking him down. Catfish recovered and tired again to kill Randy. But Randy managed to break free and destroy his magic powder bag, leaving him powerless. Now like this, his animals turned on him and chased him off.\n\nCatfish reappears in the episode \"[[Bring Me the Head of Ranginald Bagel!]]\" In this episode, he is confronted by [[Hannibal McFist]] and [[Willem Viceroy|Viceroy]] to learn the identity of the ninja. Catfish misinforms the villainous duo that [[Ranginald Bagel]] was the ninja, still believing the lie Randy told him during their first encounter in \"Swampy Seconds\".\n\nIn the season one finale episode \"[[Randy Cunningham: 13th Century Ninja]]\", due to Randy's meddling in the past, the [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|Sorcerer]] lost four of his [[Chaos Pearls]] before he was trapped by both Randy and the original ninja. One of the pearls has been discovered in modern times by Catfish Booray.\n\nCatfish returns in the episode \"[[Welcome Back Catfish]]\". Now under the control of the Sorcerer, Catfish masquerades as a substitute teacher to gain access into Norrisville High in an attempt to the set the Sorcerer free from his prison.\n\nHe is later mentions in \"[[Julian's Birthday Surprise|Julian\u2019s Birthday Surprise]]\", where Howard reminds Randy of the Chaos Pearl he brought to Julian's birthday party.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Booray is the second villain, the other being [[Mac Antfee]], to appear more than once and not be [[Hannibal McFist|McFist]], Viceroy, or the Sorcerer.\n**However, unlike Mac and the Sorceress, Booray didn't disappear after his second appearance.\n*After the credits of \"Randy Cunningham: 13th Century Ninja\", Booray finds a Chaos Pearl, which zaps him. The Sorcerer takes control over his body, but is unable to do this once Randy takes Catfish out of reach in \"Welcome Back Catfish\".\n*He is the only villain to have his own [[His Name is Catfish|theme song]].\n*He is the only villain to be turned into two different monsters without ever being stanked once.\n*He is one of the few people who knows Randy is the Ninja, but he doesn't know Randy's real name, thinking that it is \"Ranginald Bagel.\"\n*\"Welcome Back Catfish\" is the only episode with Catfish's appearance in Season 2.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSwampySeconds_-_152.jpg\nCatfish_Booray_glowing_eyes.png\nSwampySeconds_-_166.jpg\nSwampySeconds_-_180.jpg\nSwampySeconds_-_194.jpg\nCatfish Booray06.png\nSwampySeconds_-_352.jpg\nSwampySeconds_-_aintthatright.jpg\nCatfish Booray03.png\nCatfish Booray04.png\nSwampySeconds_-_527.jpg\nSwampySeconds - 541.jpg\nCatfish Booray05.png\nSwampySeconds_-_574.jpg\nSwamparmyadvance.jpg\nSwampy Seconds - 604.jpg\nSwampy_Seconds_-_615.jpg\nSwampy Seconds - 625.jpg\nSwampy Seconds - 623.jpg\nSwampySeconds_-_power_of_smoke_bomb.jpg\nBooray_-_Spilt_my_gumbos.jpg|\"You spilt mah gumbos!\"\nCatfishBooray07.png\nCatfish Booray - Pythanthigator form.jpg|Catfish Booray in the form of the Pythanthigator\nSwampy Seconds - 802.jpg\nBringmeranginaldbagel_-_171.jpg|Booray meets with Mcfist and Vicroy\nThe Sorcerer150.png|Catfish Booray discovering the [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|Sorcerer]]'s Chaos Pearls at the end of \"Randy Cunningham: 13th Century Ninja\"\nCatfish Booray& The Sorcerer.png\nWelcomeBackCatfish - 508.jpg\nCatfish Booray02.png\nCatfish Booray07.jpg\nCatfish Booray08.png\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Booray, Catfish}}\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
