Amira is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Amira is a rather unfriendly, gossip loving woman who resides in Hateno Village with her family.. She can usually be found chatting with fellow villager Nikki at the water trough next to her family's general store, the East Wind. However, she despises others who try to listen in on her conversation and will harshly tell Link off if he tries to speak with her. If Link attempts to speak to Nikki instead, Amira admonishes him for trying to eavesdrop. Link can hide out behind the trough to overhear what they're saying as they talk about a little girl being spotted in the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab. Amira thinks that perhaps the people living in the lab adopted her, but Nikki disagrees.
At 9 o'clock, Amira decides she is done for the day and heads home for bed. She is clearly tired and sighs when Link attempts to converse with her, irritated with the company. She is an uneasy sleeper, often grunting or mumbling as she dreams.
If Link tries to speak with her in the morning, she asks him to leave her alone.
