Time Cheyenne Jackson Descendants inspiration Hades the Greek God the Underworld Satan Jeffrey Katzenberg Hera from Greco Roman mythology awards Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer Animated Program Hades the main antagonist Walt Disney Animation Studios Disney 1997 animated feature film Hercules film Hercules the fast talking god the Underworld known for having fiery temper and vendetta against his eldest brother Zeus Hercules Zeus Over the span eighteen years Hades developed scheme take over Mount Olympus and the cosmos but prophecy the Fates foretold that Hercules character hero would rise against him and end his reign While the Hades Greek mythology was not particularly malevolent the Disney version portrays him evil figure albeit comedic This interpretation the character proved successful making Hades Disney u2019s most popular antagonists and primary member the Disney Villains line Hades was granted ownership the Underworld Zeus unwillingly Unbeknownst Zeus and the other deities however Hades despises the Underworld well his job finding them both gloomy depressing and overbearing Because this Hades secretly plots overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus the King Deities himself Though powerful his own right Hades considerably weaker than Zeus and cannot overthrow him alone such often allies himself with various beasts and creatures lurking through Greece hiring them his bidding the most notable example being the Titans who were imprisoned Zeus eons ago the Underworld Hades aided his shapeshifting lackeys Pain and Panic The fear Hades immensely and are used punching bags during his outbursts typically punishment for their incompetence being recurring hindrance Hades schemes Despite their constant colossal failures and lies Hades seems have surprising amount faith these imps continuously sends them out with various missions and tasks most which are rather major Hades hot headed both figuratively and literally When relaxed upbeat his flaming hair and skin retain calming blue color When angered his hair and face become passionate red orange Originally Hades was envisioned more somber and dramatic villain similar vein Ursula from The Little Mermaid Jafar from Aladdin film Aladdin This early slow talking portrayal the character was intended played Jack Nicholson much that character designer Gerald Scarfe initial sketches Hades bore resemblance Nicholson Nicholson visited the studio and met with directors John Musker and Ron Clements 1995 familiarize himself with the character However Nicholson left the project because demanded million plus cut all the proceeds from Hades merchandise which Disney declined addition Nicholson Willem Dafoe David Bowie and John Lithgow were once considered for the role Hades Lithgow was released from the role because the directors thought did not work Like with the original Nicholson version Hades was still portrayed fairly serious light during auditions The direction the character altered greatly however when James Woods auditioned for the role the procedure with the previous actors Woods was asked give straightforward performance Under the belief that wasn right for that portrayal Woods approached Hades casually delivering dialogue were sleazy car salesmen This impressed the filmmakers much that the character was rewritten into comical villain with heavy emphasis humor Some Hades most memorable lines were libbed Woods the decades following the release Hercules Woods has remained openly fond and protective the role Hades and has gone record saying will always return reprise the role should the character used for any purpose u2014true his word Woods has voiced Hades everything from television shows video games and theme park attractions for over decades with the notable exceptions the Our House Now song Mickey House Villains which Rob Paulsen did Hades singing voice and the DuckTales 2017 series DuckTales episode New Gods the Block which Chris Diamantopoulos voiced Hades the Lord the Underworld Hades hot headed fast talker who hates ruling the Underworld His dream take over Mount Olympus Hades generally calm cool and collected Though his machinations are cruel Hades informal approach villainy makes him widely comedic character with self aware and irreverent style humor though his jokes are usually played for his own twisted amusement and the expense others However this partly surface level Hades eternally bitter and imperious with his most famous trait being his uncontrollably fervid temper times the smallest inconveniences can send Hades over the edge causing fiery fits and extreme damage the area and people around him depending the situation This quality makes him feared figure among Greece and beyond especially the eyes his minions Pain and Panic For all his power Hades match for his eldest brother What Hades lacks physical strength however makes for cunning incredibly meticulous with his scheming going far patiently wait eighteen years unleash attack upon Mount Olympus also rather analytical upon witnessing Hercules strength firsthand Hades instantly knew that his newborn nephew could cause issues with his plans and sought eliminate the problem immediately albeit unsuccessfully Having learned from the Fates his eventual takeover Mount Olympus Hades plotted dispose Hercules First sending Pain and Panic kidnap baby Hercules give him potion that would render him mortal and kill him However unbeknownst Hades Hercules didn drink every last drop thus retaining his godlike strength Hades didn learn that Hercules survived until grew into adult and hero training Determined humiliate the hero Hades sends monsters destroy Hercules Hades watches excitedly uses Meg lure Hercules into fixed contest facing the multi headed Hydra determined humiliate the hero only for the Hydra defeated rockslide and Hercules emerging from the monster claw Frustrated that none the monsters have worked Hades hits upon new plan send reluctant Meg stop him hoping that Herc will become too distracted his attraction for Meg fight learn his weaknesses When learns that Hercules has fallen love with Megara Hades uses this his advantage and makes deal with Hercules give his strength for the next twenty four hours then reveals that Meg was working for him the whole time crushing Hercules will fight Unfortunately Hercules gains his strength back and defeats the Titans and Hades after saving Meg soul from the Underworld addition his own intellect Hades relies schmoozing get what wants more than his godly power u2014acting along the lines seedy car salesman con artist Even honest god and keeps his end the bargain with every deal matter what the stakes are Additionally Hades seems willing give people second chances constantly giving Pain and Panic important tasks spite their constant failures also implied somewhat sympathetic Megara willing free Meg least reduce her time servitude long she helps him conquer the Olympus Also when reminding her how she ended his prisoner Hades called Megara boyfriend creep implying that even Hades was disgusted what did after Meg saved him Hades appears blue gray humanoid with flaming blue hair wearing black robe and smoky base When gets angry his skin turns red and bursts into flames especially his hair which becomes yellow orange has yellow eyes and sharp teeth Immortality god Hades lives eternally does not age nor can die Endurance Though his endurance extremely high being able withstand lava and freezing cold temperatures Hades not impervious pain evidenced his fear Zeus and his lightning bolts Fire Manipulation Much like Zeus with clouds and lightning Hades power mainly derived from fire and smoke much that his hair made flames Hades can summon fire will attack his enemies and cause damage anything his vicinity The extent his literal firepower practically unlimited was able burn entire forest the ground matter seconds result outburst His fire fatal mortals and can severely damaging otherworldly beings seen with Pain and Panic even deities seen with Hecate Smoke Manipulation With smoke Hades can conjure objects and creatures from thin air also uses smoke means teleport himself with the snap finger Hades cloak appears made smoke specifically its base Hades can also turn his arms into extendable smokey appendages and use them grab things people from

the Underworld with the power turn gods into mortals Dominion over the Dead the Lord the Underworld Hades holds dominion over the dead and the spirits those who died Regardless does not rule the dead the Underworld the spirits the River Styx have apparently threatened him least once and they dragged him down the Styx upon his defeat Hades first seen appearing Mount Olympus during Hercules character Hercules christening None the gods are happy see him After greeting them Hades goes Baby Hercules crib and attempts put Skull Pacifier spiked skull shaped pacifier into the baby mouth almost succeeds but then the baby grabs and squeezes his finger causing him drop the pacifier and begins insult Hercules under his breath After Zeus fails cheer him Hades leaves pain Humiliated his brother

had not previously alerted him Hades goes and consults with the Fates his plan take over Mount Olympus They tell him that when the planets align eighteen years Hades will able unleash the horrible Titans and that they would lead him victory and power However Hercules intervenes this will all backfire Hades sends Pain and Panic turn Hercules mortal with Mortal Potion special potion that they can kill him but Hercules does not drink the last drop retains his godlike strength and uses defend himself Pain and Panic cover for their failure claiming they killed Hercules allowing Hades continue with his planning the mix comes across girl named Megara who sells her soul him order save her boyfriend life However once has revived the boy abandons Meg for another woman breaking her heart and leaving her Hades hands Since then Meg works with Hades rule Olympus though she merely does because she has choice and often mocks the god temper with sarcastic quip Years Hades sends Meg recruit Nessus This backfires however when Hercules intervenes When Hades discovers through this that Hercules still alive takes matters into his own hands Using Meg lure Hercules into fixed contest facing the Hydra Hades smiles smugly watches the man destined defeat him struggle under the attacks only for Hercules slay the Hydra rockslide that seems have killed both until Hercules emerges from the monster claw After sending army monsters defeat Hercules all which fail Hades sends Meg seduce Hercules and find his weakness Meg falls love with Hercules their following date and forgets about the mission simply saying that has weakness when asks Hades deduces that Hercules love for Meg his weakness and uses her trick Hercules into giving his godlike strength for day for Meg safety Hercules agrees and Hades knowing Hercules will not interfere not only unleashes the Titans last but also sends the Cyclops kill Hercules while powerless Meanwhile Hades ignites attack Mount Olympus successfully imprisoning Zeus and the others deities the process thus allowing the throne fall into his hands During the Cyclops attack Hercules pillar falls Meg severely injuring her This breaks Hades promise that Meg would not hurt causing Hercules regain his strength Hercules proceeds Mount Olympus where engages the Titans and eventually defeats them thwarting Hades invasion However Meg has died because her injuries thanks the Fates clipping her life thread and Hades claims her soul his consolation prize knowing how much her death will hurt Hercules Hercules storms into the Underworld subdues Cerberus and confronts Hades demanding returns Meg him Hades smugly explains Hercules that Meg dead and cannot have her back Hercules offers his soul exchange for Meg and Hades displays moment being genre savvy seeing the deal almost too good true However decides agree the condition that Hercules must retrieve her himself not until Hercules has already dived into the River Styx that Hades shouts that the former will dead before can reach Meg The Fates attempt cut Hercules life thread but are unable Hercules genuinely heroic sacrifice causes him become god making him immortal Hercules emerges from the river carrying Meg soul Hades astounded attempts smooth talk Hercules again who angrily punches him sending Hades into the river where swarmed the souls trapped inside and dragged into its depths unknown what happened him afterward though Pain and Panic commentary implies that Hades may trapped within the river for quite some time not eternity During the end credits when the thanks the staff are shown Hades voice heard saying that everyone got happy ending but him Then asks anyone listening and talking hyperspace Contrary film canon where Hades was unaware Hercules survival until the demigod was the animated series shows that Hades often faces off against teenage Hercules Hades tries many schemes destroy Hercules and take over Olympus plans including exposing the other gods water from the river Lethe thus making them all forget their original roles and leaving him free take over diverting the River Styx into Greece killing Zeus when temporarily made himself mortal prove point Hercules Despite all these transgressions never expelled from godhood frequently being summoned Mount Olympus for job related matters afterward Hades shown have very poor working relationship with those his service primarily the witch Hecate who frequently attempts usurp control the underworld out from under him Despite Hades attempts frequently abandon the underworld for Mount Olympus seems protective the job when threatened taken away from him Hercules and the Arabian Night episode notably teamed with Aladdin character Aladdin deceased arch enemy Jafar and used

thanks Icarus and Hercules messing with the Tapestry Fate Hades alerted the Tapestry existence allowing him create alternate reality where Hades King Olympus while Zeus became Lord the Underworld They

this show Hades has gone soft recent years and doesn regain his evil nature will lose control over the Underworld Hades visits the most powerful Disney Villains help recapture his infamous cruelty Hades personality and Yiddish mannerisms are said based Jeffrey Katzenberg former Disney Studios Chairman who left the company bad terms start DreamWorks Animation Hades the few classic villains without memorable song However does have recurring instrumental theme which may found Speak the Devil the Hercules soundtrack Hercules soundtrack the Hercules series Hades sings Town when takes over Athens unclear why Hades was not aware that Hercules had not been killed Pain and Panic back when Hercules was baby seeing that the Lord the Dead the most likely explanation that does not keep track specific details about his role and simply assumed that all had gone according plan But the series Hades claimed that someone was dead would know about Hades appearance the series contradicts the film believed that Hercules was dead when was teenager during the film This open inconsistency with the production crew allow him written into episodes The Greek god Hades was not evil fact was the more personable deities Ancient Greece despite his job lord the dead However many other versions for instance the 2010 remake Clash the Titans depict him villain like the Disney version Another detail regarding Hades that was left out the film was that was married Persephone the goddess spring and the had functional relationship Persephone had been planned written into episode the Hercules animated series the subject custody battle between Hades and Demeter While Persephone received design for the show the episode ultimately went unproduced due the heavy nature its plot the original myths Hades was the six children the Titan Kronos and the grandson Gaia the Earth The Disney version does not implicate his relationship Hera Demeter Hestia who were his sisters the myth but shown that Zeus Hercules Zeus and Poseidon are brothers like mythology although the myths had Hades the oldest brother whereas the Disney version has this the other way around seems have strong hatred for the Goddess the Night Hecate calling her witch the conference the Olympians She turn wants his throne and steals his power Hades the few villains with historic significance Others include Prince John Governor Ratcliffe John Ratcliffe and the Hun Army Hades the only villain meet Jafar another Disney villain media canon his film origin having conspired with Jafar the Hercules series the film Hades also the only deity that lacks glowing aura instead possessing smoke emitting from the base his robe Hades depicted the Disney movie with control over fire pyromania whereas fire actually element not related with Hades being earth and gold actually the closest element Hades the fire probably give him some association with the common idea the Devil augmenting the idea villain and comically with his hot head personality Because blue flames burn higher temperature than regular red orange flames the implication that Hades turns red when gets angry when heats inaccurate Technically Hades hotter when calm than when angry However blue usually seen color representing calmness and red anger the inaccuracy usually accepted for the sake artistic license Hades considered the oldest the Disney Villains due him being immortal god Hades name used the name level Disney Heroes Battle Mode called Hades Street even before became playable character Hercules characters"
