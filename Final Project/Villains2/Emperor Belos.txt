He is the ruler of [[the Boiling Isles]], and founder of the Coven system. Emperor Belos needs the portal to the Human Realm, but he says he does not plan invading it but something else for \"the Day of Unity\".\n\n==Background ==\nFifty years ago, at the time the series began, witches on the Boiling Isles use to wield and mix magic freely until he came and restricted the usage of magic. He declared that he alone could speak to the island, and convinced the witches of the isles that their usage of magic was wrong. His teachings came into place, his strength grew, and became the Emperor of the Boiling Isles. He taught that mixing magic was wrong and only he had that right. He created the coven system to restrict the use and knowledge of magic, and those who resisted were declared wild witches who would face harsh punishments.\n\nIn his years of power, Belos retreated into his [[Emperor Belos' Castle|castle]] where he spent his time planning and preparing for what he calls the \"Day of Unity\", which is a day that will bring the end of wild magic and create a modern utopia. As revealed in \"[[Hunting Palismen]],\" he is Hunter's uncle that took him in after claiming their family was destroyed by wild magic. At an unknown point in time, Belos gained a curse similar to the Owl Beast Curse via the use of wild magic. Combined with the demise of his and Hunter's family at the hands of wild magic, Belos developed a strong hatred for wild magic and all things considerably related to it, even forbidding his nephew from further researching the art.\n\n=== Physical appearance ===\nEmperor Belos wears a mask with two long, upward-facing horns. His eyes are hollow through the mask creating the appearance of having no eyeballs. He wears a large cape with white and brown, as well as gold trim. Under the mask, Belos is revealed to be a middle-aged man with wrinkly lips and a notch on his left ear similar to Hunter's. Most prominently though, he has a large, greenish scar running across his face and down his neck with holes that seem to be eroding it, an indication of how severely his unknown illness is affecting his body.\n\n=== Personality ===\nBelos is described to be an omnipotent and megalomaniac. He is shown to be a strict and commanding figure, impatient and not tolerating failure from his subordinates. His authority is shown to be a powerful one that garners fear and respect. However, he does seem to care about Hunter, his nephew and apparently remaining family member, although he will be hard on him for failure and is very disapproving of the boy's interest in wild magic, but only because he doesn't want anything bad to happen to him.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Belos voice actor Matthew Rhys considers him to be \"misunderstood\" rather than actually evil.<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/CEHnVhPjWHg/]</ref>\n*The Emperor's name is misspelled as \"Bellows\" in the closed captioning.\n*The word \"belos\" means \"beautiful\" in several Iberian and Mediterranean languages, such as Portuguese, Galician, and Corsican.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nAgony of a Witch (29).png\nAgony of a Witch (39).png\nAgony of a Witch (40).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (4).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (6).png\nThe Owl House Mid Season Sneak Peek (23).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (7).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (56).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (62).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (64).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (65).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (66).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (69).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (70).png\nThe Owl House S2 (40).png|\"Knock, knock, human.\"\nFile:Hunting Palismen (5).png\nFile:Hunting Palismen (10).png\nFile:Hunting Palismen (11).png\nFile:Hunting Palismen (12).png\nFile:Hunting Palismen (14).png\nThe Owl House S2 (10).png\nBelos_Face.jpg\nEclipse Lake (4).jpg\nEclipse Lake (5).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nOwl House Season 1B - Drawing by Dana Terrace.jpg\nThe Owl House Season 2 poster.jpg\nFile:Early belos tests 1.jpg\nFile:Early belos research.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:theowlhouse:Emperor Belos|Emperor Belos]] on [[w:c:theowlhouse|The Owl House Wiki]]\n\n{{The Owl House}}\n[[pt-br:Imperador Belos]]\n[[Category:The Owl House characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Emperors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
