He is the main antagonist of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''. Like his name suggests, he is a sentient planet with terraforming abilities.\n\nEgo the Living Planet was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]''====\nEgo does not make an appearance, but he is alluded to when [[Star-Lord|Peter Jason Quill]] ponders his father's identity. When Quill holds the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Stone]] enclosed inside the [[Orb]], he was miraculously able to survive its power; a later scan performed by the [[Nova Corps]] revealed that this was because of his half-human heritage from his father's side. When [[Yondu Udonta]] and the [[Ravagers]] are leaving, it is revealed that Ego hired them to bring Peter to him years ago, but instead the Ravagers kept Peter as one of their own.\n\n====''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''====\nIn the beginning of the film, Ego came to Earth in 1980 and started his relationship with [[Meredith Quill]]. Soon, Ego had a son named Peter with her, but would later leave Earth due to Meredith's cancer.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] are escaping the Sovereigns. When [[Ayesha]] sends a fleet of drones and attacks the [[Milano]], the spaceship crash landed on [[Berhert]], where Ego, accompanied by his ward [[Mantis]], shows up and reunites with his son. After explaining about his past to the Guardians, Ego encourages them to visit his home planet so that Quill can learn more about his lineage. Out of the Guardians, Quill, [[Gamora]], and [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] join him, while [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]] and [[Groot|baby Groot]] stay behind to watch over their captive, [[Nebula]].\n\nOn Ego's planet, Ego explains that he is a Celestial, a living planet that can generate and control anything made from him, and the body seen before the Guardians is but an avatar he can use to freely move and communicate with others. Training Quill, Ego helps his son unlock his Celestial abilities. However, Ego's true plot soon emerges - Ego wants Quill to contribute his Celestial power so that he can terraform the various planets he has visited, transforming them into extensions of Ego. Ego also reveals that he caused Meredith's cancer from fear that his love for her would get in the way of his plans. Quill turns against his father after the revelations, destroying Ego's avatar with his fellow Guardians. However, the Guardians have to also destroy Ego's core to stop the Celestial permanently. At the same time, they find themselves fighting [[Ayesha]] and her Sovereign Flying Fleet descending on Ego's planet.\n\nMantis uses her abilities against Ego to make him go to sleep, buying time for the Guardians to place a bomb inside Ego's core. However, Mantis is stricken unconscious, reawakening Ego who quickly subdues all the Guardians and continues his expansion across planets. From Yondu's encouragement and care for his friends, Quill unlocks his full Celestial power and battles Ego to allow the other Guardians to escape. Meanwhile, Groot places the bomb inside Ego's form, which Ego senses and pleads Quill by claiming that Ego's death means the loss of Quill's powers. To Ego's shock, Quill accepts the inevitable and lets the bomb detonate, destroying Ego's core and his human avatar simultaneously. With Ego's death, his planetary body collapses.\n\n====''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''====\nEgo is mentioned in Infinity War by [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] when he tells [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] that he had to kill his father Ego as he wanted to destroy the universe to relate to Thor on having to kill his half-sister, [[Hela]].\n\n====''[[What If...?]]''====\nEgo appears at the end of the [[What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?|second episode]], after Yondu and the Ravagers accidentally abduct T'Challa, and not his son.\n\n===Marvel Animated Universe===\n====''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''====\nEgo debuted in the episode \"All About Ego\". Like the comics, he is a living planet that has the ability to control its own surface. He can create cannon, fissures, and many challenging problems for any hero on his surface. But in the center of Ego is his true form - a miniature version of Ego who is the heart of the planet. He has a big mouth and acts similar to the [[Red Hulk]]. Later on, he returns as an ally to the Hulks, and allows them to pilot his planet body in \"Planet Monster\" during the battle against the Supreme Intelligence and [[Kree]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], Ego is Star-Lord's father, while in the comics his father is [[J'son|J'son of Spartax]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 141.jpg\nEgoreforming.jpg\nGotGV2_Home_Video_10.png\nEgo Rock Face.png\nEgo_planetform.png\nEgo.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nEgo_Funko.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGOTG Vol.2 Character Poster 08.jpg\nEgo Planet Form.jpg\nfilm-ego-the-living-planet-comic-books-ego-the-living-20240762.png|Ego's Planet Form from the movie and comic\nthor202_3.jpg|Ego's human form from the comics.\n15932d7afebbacba0dc52233342db0c9.jpg|Human form comparison.\nGOTG2 - Ego the Living Planet.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Guardians of the Galaxy characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Planets]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Guardians of the Galaxy locations]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Locations]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:What If...? characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Timeline Versions]]"
