"[[File:Jennifer_Claudia.jpg|thumb|250px|Jennifer (left) and Claudia (right)]]\n'''Jennifer and Claudia''' are two beautiful blonde twin girls on ''[[The Replacements]]''. They are normally seen with [[Sierra McCool]]. The girls make their first (non-speaking) appearance in \"[[The Jerky Girls]]\" and their last appearance in \"[[R2: A Tale of Two Rileys]]\".\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nJennifer has wavy hair in a ponytail. She wears pink hoop earrings, a periwinkle dress, and purple shoes. Starting with season 2, she wears a purple belt and stud earrings. Claudia has shorter hair than Jennifer. She wears an aqua green dress with a pink flower in the center, and blue shoes.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the first season episodes \"[[The Insecurity Guard]]\" and \"[[Carnie Dearest]]\", a common gag was for the two girls to be commenting on what they are wearing (which are actually identical to each other), when Todd lands in a mud puddle next to them, ruining their clothes. (\"The Insecurity Guard\" also marked their first speaking appearance, although Jennifer had two brief lines in the previous episode \"[[CindeRiley]]\".)\n*The show never actually reveals whether or not they are sisters (let alone twins), but this fact is hinted, based on the gag above.\n*Jennifer wears earrings, while Claudia does not.\n*Both of the girls wear socks with their shoes.\n*Jennifer was voiced by Lauren Tom, while Claudia was voiced by Erica Hubbard for season 1 and Tempestt Bledsoe for season 2. (Jennifer spoke less in season 2, than she did in season 1.)\n*Coincidentally, the name \"Claudia\" was also used for one of the names for [[the Bimbettes]] from ''Beauty and the Beast'', who similar to Jennifer and Claudia, were also a set of identical blonde sisters (in their case, triplets).\n*Both Jennifer and Claudia like being with Sierra the same way [[W:c:camplazlo: Chip and Skip|Chip and Skip]] like being with [[W:c:camplazlo:Edward Platypus|Edward Platypus]] from [[W:c:camplazlo:Camp Lazlo|Camp Lazlo]].\n\n== Inspiration ==\n\n* [[Flotsam and Jetsam]]\n\n* [[Mr. Smee]]\n\n* [[LeFou]]\n\n* [[Jasper and Horace]]\n\n* [[Pain and Panic]]\n\n* [[Fungus]]\n\n* Chip and Skip from Camp Lazlo\n* [[The Bimbettes]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nJenniferClaudiainJackets.jpeg|The girls in jackets\nThe Insecurity Guard (2).jpg\nJenniferClaudiaCoveredinMud.jpeg\nJenniferClaudiaCarnivalOutfits1.png|The girls in carnival outfits\nJenniferClaudiaCarnivalOutfits2.png\nJennfierClaudiaGrabbingRiley.jpg\nDeviousClaudia.jpg|\"Devious...\"\nShiftyEyesJennifer.jpg|\"...and shifty.\"\nJenniferClaudiaCheerleading.png\nJenniferComplaining.png|\"If we're not cheerleaders, then... what are we?!\"\nJenniferClaudiaCheerPressure.png\nSierraandGirlswithJohnny.png\nSierraandGirlsattheDance.png\nJenniferClaudiaCinderRiley.png\nJenniferSierraandClaudiainTurhtHurts.png|Jennifer and Claudia with Sierra in \"The Truth Hurts\"\nClaudiaTruthHurts.png|(about Johnny) \"Uh!
