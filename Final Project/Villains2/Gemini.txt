The payloads vary from explosives to self-guided ammunition. The missiles reload from an unknown internal source. The prosthetic can also generate electric taser shocks powerful enough to render a person unconscious, including himself.\n==Role in the series==\nGemini is the leader of the [[W.E.E.]] (Worldwide Evil Empire), and also the evil fraternal twin of [[Global Justice]]'s leader, [[Betty Director]]. Gemini is the older twin by four minutes. He has always resented his sister because she didn't give him proper respect as the older sibling. He owns a little pet chihuahua dog named Pepe, who tends to get agitated whenever he hears the words, \"Global Justice\".\n\nIn \"[[The Ron Factor]]\", Gemini learns that Global Justice was seeking to harness something called the Ron Factor. When his agents failed to capture [[Ron Stoppable]], thus alerting Global Justice, Gemini decided to personally intervene and managed to succeed where they didn't, besting Ron's Global Justice security detail and [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]]. He interrogates Ron at W.E.E. headquarters for the source of the Ron Factor while revealing his connection to Doctor Director. Upon learning that Ron Factor is in fact Ron, he attempts to recruit Ron to W.E.E. by promising all the [[Bueno Nacho]] he could eat as well as assurance to spare his life. Suddenly, W.E.E. was breached by Kim and Betty. The twins soon faced each other and reveal each other's real names to [[Team Possible]]. Betty accused him of kidnapping Ron out of childish resentment for having better toys than him in their youth. Gemini suggested they call their mother for a second opinion but his twin labeled him a baby dragging their mother into their dispute. Gemini declared they'll settle their sibling rivalry like grownups and indiscriminately fired his finger missiles, inadvertently causing damage to his HQ. As he summoned his escape pod, Gemini urged Ron to join him and crush Global Justice. Quickly realizing he had upset Pepe, he looked down only to find [[Rufus]] in his place; the real Pepe was locked in a cage. Rufus then slides a finger cuff on Gemini before Ron got his hands stuck together, causing Gemini to accidentally electrocute himself, knocking him unconscious. He was then taken into custody.\n\nGemini makes a non-speaking cameo in \"[[Grande Size Me]]\". He pursues Kim while she is transporting [[Jack Hench]]'s molecular disruptor to Global Justice. He is stopped by a heavily mutated Ron.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gemini gets his name from the Zodiac sign Gemini, which is Latin for \"twins,\" which is fitting due to him being one. His name may also refer to his birth date, although this is unconfirmed.\n*Just as Dr. Director is an homage to the original version of the Marvel Comics character Nick Fury, her brother with a zodiac-themed codename is likely a reference to Nick Fury's brother Jacob, who took on the villainous alias Scorpio.\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
