Eryck is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Eryck is a Hylian traveler in search of self-discovery. In his journey, he attempted to visit Zora's Domain, only to find himself lost at the southern bank of Rutala River. As he was about to give up his journey, he heard a voice coming from the Lanayru Tower, reigniting his interest. Despite this, he was unable to cross Rutala River as it is the widest in all of Lanayru.
When Link first encounters Eryck, he is found resting underneath a Tree beside a Campfire in Rabia Plain. There, Eryck informs Link of his plight, and offers details about the landmarks north of his camp, such as Zora's Domain and Lanayru Tower. Eryck will also offer directions to the Lanayru Tower by way of Linebeck Island.


== Trivia ==
Curiously, when Eryck offers directions to Link, he erroneously states that Linebeck Island is located to the east. In reality, it is northwest of his camp site in Rabia Plain.
