I'm ssstarved.|Kaa to [[Shanti]]|The Jungle Book 2}}\n'''Kaa''' is an antagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1967]] animated feature film ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. He is an enormous snake with an equally large appetite\u2014specifically for [[Mowgli]] the man cub. Kaa's most dangerous attributes are his hypnotic eyes, which he uses to manipulate unsuspecting prey and lure them into his jaws.\n\n==Background==\n===Development===\nIn Kipling's books, Kaa was Mowgli's wise mentor, akin to Baloo and Bagheera, and was very protective of him. When the characters were adapted in the film, [[Walt Disney]] did not like the idea of a benevolent snake and so Kaa was given an antagonistic role that would serve as one of the many reasons why Mowgli must leave the jungle.\n\nHe was animated by [[Frank Thomas]] in his entrance appearance where he first met Mowgli and nearly ate him. Due to the popularity of the character among the developers, he was given another scene and his own song (\"Trust in Me\", a recycled and revised version of \"[[The Land of Sand]]\", a scrapped song from [[1964]]'s ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''), this time animated by [[Milt Kahl]]. Sterling Holloway, Kaa's voice actor, also brought his own essence to the character by using a lisped voice.\n\n===Personality===\n{{Quote|It's like you said... You can't trust anyone!|Kaa using Mowgli's words against him}}\nKaa is a sly, devious Indian Rock Python. He speaks with a soft, often entrancing tone to either lure his victims into a weary, dreamlike state or manipulate them into bestowing their trust, only to devour them unexpectedly. He furthers this by the use of his iconic ability to hypnotize his prey with his eyes, rendering them enchanted and under his command. A powerful and dangerous ability, Kaa is a feared inhabitant of the jungle. This is evidenced when the usually composed and fearless [[Bagheera]] was visibly terrified and pleaded with him when the panther stopped him from eating Mowgli. Such fear, however, does not resonate with the unofficial ruler of the jungle, [[Shere Khan]] the tiger. Kaa holds a disliking for Khan, seeing him as a hypocrite and believing the act of killing for pleasure\u2014as opposed to survival\u2014to be dishonorable. The two beasts are often at odds, though Shere Khan views Kaa as an \"eyes and ears\" of the jungle, relying on him to assist his search for [[Mowgli]] at one point in the film.\n\nWhile not inherently malevolent, Kaa is still a fairly villainous character. His first attempt to devour Mowgli was a casual and opportunistic means to eat and survive. However, his later goal to eat the man-cub was mainly driven out of spite, swearing revenge on the boy after his first attempt to eat Mowgli ended in humiliating defeat. Furthermore, he is perfectly willing to kill those who get in the way of his meals, as seen when he sadistically hypnotized, and almost harmed, Bagheera.\n\nHis sadism is further emphasized by how he gloats over Mowgli's helpless situation as he prepared to devour him. He displayed even more sadism towards Shanti as he did not only gloat over her helplessness, but also outright revealed to her that he intended to eat her knowing she was unable to do anything about it. He enjoys teasing and playing with his food, hypnotized or not. He playfully tugged at Mowgli's wrists and ankles to stop him from escaping, and later savoured the time before the kill when he hypnotized the man-cub and made him sleepwalk over his body.\n\nNevertheless, Kaa seems to insist on giving his victims a merciful end as he hypnotizes them into a state of bliss or sleep before eating them. Although powerful enough to choke the life out of his victims, he prefers to swallow them alive and whole unable to feel pain or fear. Kaa has even admitted to himself that he is sympathetic towards Mowgli to a certain extent, before remembering his own intentions to make a meal out of the boy.\n\nKaa seems to have a taste for humans, calling them \"delicious\" and \"succulent\". Even when very young, he seemed to relish the idea of eating man. Whether he has ever successfully caught and eaten a human is unknown.\n\nThough dangerous, manipulative and cunning, Kaa is not without his faults. Although he only hypnotized Mowgli when he was sure Bagheera was too sleepy to notice him, it was his own cockiness that woke the panther and made him lose his supper. He can be clumsy and easily sidetracked from his primary objective: to hypnotize and eat Mowgli. This results in his interactions with the man-cub to often end in humiliation to some degree.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nKaa is an Indian python that has grown to be extremely long for a member of his species. While his exact size is unknown, in the original book he is described as more than 30ft long. His eyes are yellow and fill with concentric circles of blue, yellow and purple when using hypnosis. He has golden scales and a lighter underbelly, and dark brown spots patterned across his back. Despite having a large body, Kaa's head and neck are small in comparison, although his mouth is large enough to take up most of his head. Kaa can dislocate his jaw to open his mouth wide enough to swallow prey far larger than his head, although this must be done head-first.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Hypnosis/Mind Control:''' Kaa's most infamous power is his unique ability to hypnotize others through eye contact and have them follow his commands. Unlike the original book where Kaa could hypnotize others through the \"Hunger Dance\" and could only hypnotize animals, Kaa here hypnotized with colored spirals and could hypnotize humans as well. Once fully hypnotized, his victims enter a trance with glassy-eyes and wide smiles on their faces which would persist even after falling asleep. This ability also works when someone sees their reflection in the water. However, his powers are not without limits. His victims' susceptibility depends on their willpower. For example, Shanti was very easily hypnotized due to her submissive nature and Bagheera's orderly mindset made him unable to resist. Mowgli was less susceptible due to his subborn nature and strong will, but was still worn down over an extended period of hypnosis. This has prompted Kaa to use his cunning to either make the boy too relaxed to fight back or to trick him into accidentally look into his eyes without time to react. It appears that repeated exposure can make a victim more suseptible. Initially it took an extended period of eye-contact to hypnotize Mowgli whereas during their second encounter the man-cub fell into a trance after only a few seconds. Finally, Kaa's hypnosis appears to have no effect on iron-willed individuals such as Shere Khan.\n*'''Powerful Coils:''' As a constrictor, Kaa makes use of his powerful coils to catch and immobilize prey. While pythons will typically squeeze their prey to the point of suffocation or cardiac arrest, Kaa seems to prefer to swallow his prey alive and uses his coils in tandem with hypnosis to ensnare a victim. They appear to have a relaxing effect, as Mowgli only began to succumb to Kaa's spell when the python began wrapping him up, and only fell completely into a trance after being choked and squeezed all over his body during their first encounter. Kaa's entire body is exteremely dexterous, able to form themselves into all sorts of shapes including hammocks, crosses and stair cases. They are also very strong; Kaa was able to perfectly balance Mowgli upside down on the tip on his tail without effort and can very easily climb trees. The coils are, however, very heavy. They have dragged him down to the ground when dislodged from tree branches on more than one occasion, and he has not appeared to notice Mowgli shoving them off tree branches until it was too late.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Jungle Book]]''===\n[[File:Jungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-900.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Kaa meets Mowgli.]]\nKaa comes across [[Mowgli]] and [[Bagheera]] in the branches of a large tree that the pair has chosen to spend the night in, just after Mowgli tells the panther he was able to look after himself. Half asleep, Bagheera is unaware of Kaa as he drops in and inspects the young boy with considerable relish. He smacks his lips and calls the boy a \"Delicious Man-Cub\", but Mowgli is more annoyed than intimidated and angrily tells Kaa to leave him alone. Bagheera, assuming Mowgli was speaking to him, sleepily orders the man-cub to go to sleep. \n\nKaa takes advantage of the situation and begins hypnotizing Mowgli to sleep, intending to devour him without alerting the panther. Mowgli tries to resist the hypnosis, but is unable to look away. Kaa proceeds to wrap his coils around the boy, providing him with overwhelming comfort and making him unable to physically resist. The relaxed Mowgli is unable to resist further and begins to succumb to the spell, but just manages to cry out to Bagheera for help. Kaa immediately silences the boy by constricting his neck with his tail, making him gulp loudly. Coiled from waist to neck and unable to resist any further, Mowgli falls into a trance and can only blissfully smile as Kaa admires his catch.\n\nBagheera sleepily tells Mowgli he'll have no more arguments until morning, unaware that Kaa had fully hypnotized and coiled the boy just feet behind him. Kaa chuckles, musing to himself and his happily smiling prey that the man-cub \"wouldn't be there in the morning\". As he lifts his freshly hypnotized man-cub off the branch, Mowgli obeys the command to sleep and Kaa prepares him for eating.\n\nIronically, it is this laugh that awakens Bagheera who turns to see Kaa bearing down on the hypnotized man-cub with his mouth open wide ready to swallow him. Bagheera rushes to the rescue, striking Kaa in the face just before Mowgli is eaten. However, Kaa is angered by the interference and begins to hypnotize Bagheera, failing to notice that Mowgli awoke when he dropped him. The boy shoves Kaa's massive coils off the branch with his feet, resulting in Kaa falling to the ground in a heap. While Mowgli slaps Bagheera awake, Kaa slithers off with a knot in his tail swearing revenge on the boy. He vows to get the boy back in his coils again, but Mowgli only laughs at the snake's crippling and humiliating defeat.\n\n[[File:Jungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-6459.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Kaa sings Mowgli to sleep.]]\nA day later, Mowgli runs away from his guardians, feeling betrayed and upset. He wanders aimlessly through the jungle until he finally sits down under a tree. Almost immediately Kaa's tail comes down from the canopy and hoists him up into the branches. Mowgli is initially shocked to see Kaa, but wants nothing to do with the snake and untangles himself telling the snake to leave him alone. Kaa tries to hypnotize him again, but Mowgli immediately looks away. The snake uses his tail to turn Mowgli's head around to look him in the eyes, but Mowgli has learned from his last encounter and is wary of the snake's gaze.\n\nFeigning to be hurt that the boy does not trust him, Kaa pretends to be benevolent. He playfully toys with Mowgli by wrapping his tail around the boy's wrist and ankle to stop him leaving (much to the man-cub's annoyance), as he tries to convince him that he wants to help him stay in the jungle.\n\nMowgli remains skeptical but out of curiosity he lowers his defenses and asks the snake how he plans to keep his word. Kaa keeps his plan ambiguous, making the offer on the condition he first has the man-cub's trust while pressing his forehead to Mowgli's. Mowgli's eyes momentarily widen, but he turns away from the snake, saying he does not trust anyone anymore. However, Kaa manages to trick Mowgli into letting his guard down by blindfolding him with a makeshift turban from his coils, insisting he is not like his friends who supposedly betrayed him.\n\nThe man-cub struggles to push him off his head, only to gaze directly into Kaa's eyes. With no time to react and unable to look away, Mowgli's eyes immediately fill with color and within seconds is successfully hypnotized once again. Kaa sings \"[[Trust in Me]]\" to his happily smiling prey, toying with the helpless boy as Mowgli obediently follows his commands. Kaa beckons Mowgli to close his eyes, having him sleepwalk off the branch and onto his coils high above the jungle floor. He rocks Mowgli in a makeshift hammock of coils, before balancing him on the tip of his tail- horizontally and upside down. Deep under Kaa's power, Mowgli begins to snore. Satisfied his prey is deeply asleep, he slides the hypnotized man-cub back into his coils and wraps him up ready for eating.\n[[File:Jungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-6628.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Kaa interrogated by Shere Khan.]]\nBefore Kaa can devour Mowgli, the suspicious Shere Khan stops by after hearing Kaa's singing. Knowing the tiger is looking for Mowgli, Kaa is forced to hide the boy in the branches above. Kaa pretends to act surprised by the tiger's visit and tells him that he was merely singing to himself to sleep off sinus troubles. The snake tries to trick Shere Khan into letting his guard down in order to hypnotize him as he did with Mowgli, but the tiger is unsympathetic and nonchalantly resists the hypnosis before shoving his head to the ground. They are then interrupted by Mowgli's snoring above them, convincing Shere Khan that Kaa is hiding something and inspects his coils. Kaa uses his cunning to hide the man-cub while showing the tiger his seemingly empty coils, convincing Shere Khan that he does not have Mowgli. Khan leaves to continue the search, but not before threatening Kaa to inform him before anyone else should he happen to come across the man-cub.\n[[File:Jungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-6961.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Kaa defeated once again.]]\nOnce he is out of earshot, Kaa shivers in disgust of the tiger's sadism, inadvertently causing his coils to unravel around Mowgli and wake him from the trance. Kaa takes a moment to pity the boy, but quickly dismisses the thought once he remembers his own intentions. Licking his lips and relishing the thought of his hypnotized man-cub waiting in the branches, he does not notice Mowgli climbing out of his coils. Mowgli is able to shove Kaa's coils off the branch and the snake is dragged to the ground once again. On the ground, Mowgli confronts Kaa for lying to him. Kaa, assuring Mowgli that it is like what he said, that he indeed cannot trust anyone, attacks him but is once again stopped by a knot in his tail getting caught in a bamboo cluster. Mowgli flees into the jungle, leaving the snake to express his animosity toward the boy. Despite his second humiliating defeat, Kaa apparently gives up trying to catch him as he slithers off to lick his wounds.\n\n===''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''===\n[[File:Junglebook2-disneyscreencaps.com-2911.jpg|thumb|250px|Kaa in ''The Jungle Book 2''.]]\nKaa returned once again as the secondary antagonist but plays a relatively smaller role in the sequel than he did in the 1967 film and his name is not even used at all. One night, Kaa appears when Mowgli meets up with Baloo near the beginning of the film. Like before, Kaa attempts to eat Mowgli but faces many accidents and injuries as he pursues them. Mowgli and Baloo remain unaware of Kaa's presence, and the two walk away unharmed.\n\nKaa angrily states that he never wants to see another man-cub again, but changes his mind after he comes across the young girl [[Shanti]], who unknowingly burns Kaa's tail with a torch while searching for Mowgli in the jungle. Licking his lips surreptitiously, Kaa lurks in the trees above the girl in order to frighten her and surprise her when the time is right. By the time Kaa manages to corner her, Shanti realizes that someone is stalking her and frighteningly asks who it is. Kaa then finally reveals himself and as Shanti lacks survival skills, she falls easily for Kaa's trick, looking directly into his eyes and gives a blissful smile when the hypnosis starts taking effect, putting her in a trance immediately.\n\n[[File:41519 ga.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Kaa hypnotizes Shanti.]]\nOnce Shanti drops her torch, she is left completely defenseless, allowing Kaa to sadistically gloat over her helplessness as much as he pleases. Kaa inquires whether Shanti is lost, stroking her hair before making her nod her head in agreement. Slithering around the young damsel in distress, Kaa asks her if she is hungry. Nuzzling her cheek, Kaa whispers into Shanti's ear that he is starving, gloating about the girl's impending doom. The snake makes Shanti step on top of a boulder and positions her to be devoured. Shanti looks up at Kaa vacantly as he hovers above her, preparing to strike. Fortunately, [[Ranjan]] saves Shanti's life by pulling her away from Kaa's jaws just as the snake was about to eat her, making him swallow the boulder Shanti was standing on instead. Shanti falls to the ground and snaps out of the trance as Ranjan mercilessly beats up Kaa with a stick. Kaa flees from Ranjan and tries to slither down a hill but the weight of the boulder causes him to tumble down until he hits a coconut tree.\n\nKaa laments over his humiliating defeat but is suddenly encountered by Shere Khan in his search for Mowgli, who mocks the snake until he hears him vent his frustration over a man-cub. Shere Khan interrogates him, thinking he is referring to Mowgli and demands information about his whereabouts. Kaa assures Shere Khan that all he knows is that Mowgli has recently left the Man Village, but truthfully has no idea where he is at the moment. Shere Khan does not believe him and begins to lose his temper as he reiterates his demand. To save himself from Shere Khan's wrath, Kaa fearfully lies to the tiger that Mowgli is in the swamp. Shere Khan doubts his claim but nevertheless lets him go after threatening to make him pay if he is lying. Kaa insists Mowgli is in the swamp and even assures him that he would come with him if not for the boulder he accidentally swallowed earlier, which he fears is going to cause him indigestion very soon.\n\nKaa is not seen again for the rest of the film but is mentioned by Shere Khan when he arrives at the swamp where Mowgli is nowhere to be seen and angrily splashes the water after realizing that Kaa lied to him. He is mentioned again by Shanti to Baloo, who briefly said she was attacked by a snake. Lastly, after Shanti, Mowgli, and Rajan reunite with their families, Ranjan proudly tells [[Ranjan's Father|his father]] that he saved Shanti's life from a snake.\n\n===''[[Jungle Cubs]]''===\n[[File:KaaJunglecubs.png|thumb|left|250px|Kaa in ''Jungle Cubs''.]]\nKaa appeared as a much younger snake in the ''Jungle Cubs'', with [[Baloo]], [[Bagheera]], [[Colonel Hathi]], [[King Louie]], and [[Shere Khan]]. Here, he is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] and, unlike the movie, he is a protagonist, which interestingly, actually follows the original story, unlike the film.\n\nAs a younger snake, Kaa has yet to master hypnosis at his young age, usually failing or hypnotizing the wrong person by mistake. Kaa is more of the cowardly friend in the group, often being doubtful when an adventure is at hand. Most of the time, his fearfulness can be understandable, being that the children often find themselves in some of the most dangerous predicaments in their jungle. Kaa is often seen attempting to eat a local shrew with a wise-cracking persona. However, as the shrew is too clever for the snake, he ultimately fails in the end.\n\nDuring the first season, Kaa appears in the same color as in the original movie, whilst in the second season, his skin is light green and his spots are magenta. He also appears to be slightly shorter than the previous season, despite turning older with the rest of the cubs, and also still has the same voice and actor.\n\nMany episodes revolve around Kaa, including one where his birthday arrived, and yet everyone forgot. To make up for it, they acted as if his hypnotism was excellent and pretended to be in trances. In the end, however, Kaa discovers this and breaks down. His friends comfort him and apologize, leaving all to be well.\n\nIn the ''Jungle Cubs: Born to Be Wild'' DVD, Kaa, as an adult, was the first character to be revisited by Baloo, Mowgli, and Bagheera. Here, he attempts to devour Mowgli whilst he rested, but Baloo foiled the snake by grabbing his tail and throwing him into a gorge. once he got stuck in a hole in the ruins because he was eating too much.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:Image_0103.jpg|thumb|250px|Kaa in ''Mickey's House of Villains''.]]\nKaa makes several cameos in the show ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\", he is seen being threatened by Shere Khan while [[Ludwig Von Drake]] sings a song.\n\nIn \"[[Turkey Day]]\", Kaa was seen attempting to devour Mowgli after not receiving a turkey for dinner.\n\nIn \"[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]\", he is seen sitting at a table with Baloo, Mowgli, Shere Khan, and Bagheera.\n\nIn \"Unplugged Club\", [[King Louie]] was seen grabbing Kaa (who was hanging above next to him) by the neck and shaking him like a rattle as [[Mickey Mouse]] went over to thank [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] for using one of his [[Lightning Bolts|lightning bolts]] to repower the club.\n\nIn \"[[Max's Embarrassing Date]]\", he is seen sitting a table with Sir Hiss.\n\nIn \"[[Goofy's Menu Magic]]\", Kaa is seen having coiled and hypnotized Mowgli when Mickey mentioned the guests were getting hungry.\n\nIn ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', Kaa joins his fellow villains in taking over the House of Mouse on Halloween. He joins in the hostile takeover during the song \"[[It's Our House Now!]]\", while attempting to hypnotize Minnie, during which he briefly reprises \"Trust in Me\". He later stands by [[Jafar]]'s side when he battles Mickey and soon enough flees with the other villains when Mickey and his friends defeat Jafar.\n\n===Other appearances===\nA pink snake resembling Kaa was among the soccer match spectators in ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.\n\nA snake-like character resembling Kaa made a cameo during the final scene of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', with the other Disney characters.\n\nA snake resembling Kaa made a cameo in ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode, \"[[Sweet Duck of Youth]]\". He was seen when Scrooge was walking through the swamps alone.\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n===''[[Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book]]''===\n[[File:Real_Kaa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kaa in ''Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book''.]]\nA far more menacing incarnation of the character appeared in the [[1994]] live-action adaptation. He was brought to life using an anaconda but the bulk of his appearances were made using a mixture of CGI and animatronics. Kaa seemed to serve [[King Louie]], killing any intruders to the city when the orangutan clapped his hands 9 times to summon him. Kaa attacked [[Mowgli]] inside the monkey city by tackling him into the moat and attempted to drown him, but Mowgli wounded him with a bejeweled dagger, the python is then seen fleeing in a cloud of his blood.\n\nBy the time Mowgli returns to the city with Captain [[William Boone]] (the main villain of the film) and [[Katherine \"Kitty\" Brydon|Kitty]], Kaa has fully healed from their prior confrontation. Mowgli flees with Kitty when he hears King Louie summoning the snake. Boone starts gathering as much treasure as he can, but suddenly notices that the monkeys have gone silent; Kaa suddenly appears, then scares the injured Boone into the moat, where the heavy load of treasure, he is carrying weighs him straight to the bottom in a cloud of his own blood. Desperately trying to struggle free, Boone sees the skeletal remains of Kaa's past victims, just seconds before the villain finally meets his death by the snake.\n\nThe most likely reason for this change in adaptation is because, in the original story of The Jungle Book, the treasure within the monkey city was guarded by a cobra.\n\n===[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|''The Jungle Book'' (2016)]]===\n[[File:445407-the-jungle-book-kaa.jpg|thumb|250px|Kaa in the 2016 film.]]\nKaa appears in the [[2016]] live-action film adaptation as the tertiary antagonist. Unlike in the previous adaptations, this incarnation of Kaa is a female snake, voiced by [[Scarlett Johansson]]. In this version, she is depicted as a Burmese Python and is of similar size to her book counterpart; some 30 feet long.\n\nKaa first appears when Mowgli stumbles upon her territory deep in the forest, after he is separated from Bagheera by the evil tiger named Shere Khan, where he discovers her shed snakeskin. After climbing into the trees and chasing animals that stole his food, Kaa begins to speak to him from above the trees before revealing herself to him.\n\nLuring him in by promising to keep him safe, Kaa hypnotizes him and reveals that Mowgli came to live in the jungle because Shere Khan killed his father as they were traveling between villages and that Bagheera later found Mowgli and brought him over to the wolves for protection. She also reveals to him the power of the \"Red Flower\" (fire) and its dangers in her vision. During her storytelling, she attempts to devour him, but a passing sloth bear named Baloo attacks Kaa and rescues Mowgli, freeing him in the process.\n\nKaa isn't seen again for the rest of the film and it is unknown if Baloo killed her or not. During the end credits, however, she is heard singing her song, \"Trust in Me\".\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]''===\nIn the US release of ''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]'', a snake heavily resembling Kaa appears as a boss enemy.\n\n===''[[The Jungle Book Groove Party]]''===\nKaa plays a role in the game, where he sings his own original song, \"A Mood for Food\"; replacing \"Trust in Me\" as the villainous song meant to manipulate a helpless Mowgli.\n\n===Other games===\nIn ''[[Disney Universe]]'', Kaa does not appear as an add-on character costume but appears as an accessory on a costume weapon. Concept art for the Medusa power up earlier showed 3 snakes resembling Kaa for the mask\u2019s hair.\n\nIn ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', Kaa is only briefly mentioned by Mowgli during meet-and-greets. \"If anyone sees Kaa slithering around anywhere, better let me deal with him.\"\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Disneyland Resort]]===\n[[File:Fant09_snake.jpg|thumb|250px|Kaa in the Disneyland version of Fantasmic!]]\nIn California, Kaa appears onscreen in [[Mickey and the Magical Map]], during King Louie's section.\n\nIn the [[Disneyland]] version of [[Fantasmic!]], Kaa appears in Mickey's dreams of the jungle.\n\nA light-outlined version of Kaa also appeared in [[We Love Mickey!|Mickey's MIx Magic]].\n\n=== [[Walt Disney World]] ===\nKaa appeared in several shows such as ''[[Celebrate the Magic]]'' in the [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[Wonderful World of Animation|''Wonderful World of Animation'']] in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]. He also appeared in [[Journey into the Jungle Book]] and plans to devour Mowgli as he did in the film.\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nIn [[Tokyo Disneyland]], a mosaic of Kaa appears on the ground near [[Jungle Cruise]]. Kaa was also featured in the jungle-inspired float in the former daytime parade [[Jubilation!]], as part of its 25th-anniversary celebration.\n\nIn the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] version of Fantasmic!, Kaa is seen floating about as he did in the Disneyland version.\n\n===[[Disneyland Paris]]===\nIn [[Disneyland Paris]] park, Kaa was seen in the castle spectacular [[Disney Dreams!]] during the \"I Wanna Be Like You\" section where he tries to hypnotize [[Peter Pan's Shadow|the shadow of Peter Pan]]. However, he failed when King Louie's ruins fell apart on top of him.\n\nA statue of Kaa can also be seen in the [[Adventureland (Disneyland Paris)|Adventureland]] area in the jungle section, next to a statue of [[Zazu]].\n\n===[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]===\nKaa is featured in the jungle-inspired float in the [[Flights of Fantasy Parade|Flights of Fantasy]] parade in the park. He also appeared as one of [[Maleficent]]'s invited guests during the finale of [[Villains Night Out!]].\n\n===[[Shanghai Disneyland]]===\nKaa is one of the characters part of [[Garden of the Twelve Friends]] at [[Shanghai Disneyland]], representing the Chinese Zodiac symbol of the Snake.\n\n== Differences from the source material ==\n* In the original book by Rudyard Kipling, Kaa was one of Mowgli's friends and his wisest mentor. Throughout the book, Kaa was quite loyal to Mowgli, was very protective towards him and gave him many great advises. But in the film and following appearances, Kaa is a threat to Mowgli's life.\n** The reason Kaa is depicted as an antagonist in the 1967 film is because Walt Disney believed the audience would not respond positively to a heroic snake.\n*** There was, however, a villainous snake in the books. When Kaa and Mowgli investigate the treasure-filled catacombs beneath the ancient ruins, they encounter a cobra named Thuu (also known as [[Whitehood]] in some versions), the self-proclaimed guardian of the treasure. Thuu attempts to kill Mowgli for taking a jeweled elephant goad but Kaa saves him.\n* In the books, Kaa and Mowgli have a deeper relationship. Initially, Kaa cared nothing about Mowgli and only saved him from the bandar-log because Bagheera lied to him that they insulted the python. However, once he meets Mowgli for the first time, the latter shows his gratitude for saving him. Kaa is surprised by his fearless attitude and begins to respect him for that. Later on when Mowgli returns to the jungle after destroying the man-village, he lives with Kaa until his exile from the wolf pack is over, allowing the two to bond and develop a brotherly relationship. While in the Disney versions, Kaa sees Mowgli as nothing more than a meal and Mowgli finds Kaa very annoying.\n* In the book, Kaa was able to hypnotize via dancing known as \"The Hunger Dance\". Whereas in the Disney films, he does so via colorful spirals in his eyes. But in the book, humans are immune to Kaa's hypnosis due to the complexity of the human mindset while in the films his hypnotic powers appear to work on anyone who looks directly into his eyes. However, individuals with a strong mind such as Mowgli and Shere Khan were able to resist the hypnosis.\n* Both Kipling's and Disney's versions of Kaa like to tease Mowgli. However, in the books, Kaa uses his coils to mess with Mowgli in a mischievous but friendly manner. While in the Disney version he gloats over Mowgli's helplessness as he is hypnotized.\n* Kaa's length is inconsistent in the Disney films, whereas in the books he was approximately 30 feet long (9 meters).\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite popular belief, Kaa is not a henchman to [[Shere Khan]], being the fact that he does none of his evil biddings and the two appear to dislike each other. In fact, Kaa even sympathizes with Mowgli for a moment after he finds out Shere Khan intends to kill him for immoral purposes (while Kaa does technically have the right to eat Mowgli, since he is just a simple predator who wants food).\n*Originally, Kaa was not going to be a villain in the 1967 animated film. Wolfgang Reitherman suggested that they should give that role to Tabaqui (Shere Khan's henchman from the books). However, Walt Disney turned down that idea as he wanted to refrain from using canine villains so shortly after releasing ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''.\n*[[Terry-Thomas]] was considered to voice Kaa. \n*The scene where Kaa coils around Mowgli and pulls him up to his tree is reminiscent of a moment in the books, where Kaa traps Mowgli in his coils after mistaking him for a prey and pulls him closer (though he releases him once he realized his error).\n*In the books and movies, Kaa is depicted as being an Indian Rock Python (Python molurus), a species that usually grows to 3 meters (9.8 feet). Kaa, however, is closer to 9 meters (30 feet long), much larger than normal for his species. The only snakes capable of reaching such sizes, in reality, are Green Anacondas and Reticulated Pythons, both of which can grow to such lengths and weigh from 200-500 lb.\n*Kaa means \"possession\" in Hindi.\n*Kaa is the second character who was originally voiced by [[Sterling Holloway]] and later taken over by [[Jim Cummings]], the first being [[Winnie the Pooh]].\n*Although Kaa is colored golden yellow in the original film and all of his other animated appearances, in ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]'', however, he was a shade of green.\n*Kaa was seen in concept art for the attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] over at [[Walt Disney World]], but did not appear in the finished project.\n*During one of the attempts at the classic musical number \"[[The Bare Necessities]]\" from the second film, two prickly pears land on Kaa's head and one tiny pear on his nose, making him look like [[Mickey Mouse]]. This could possibly be an example of a [[Hidden Mickey]].\n*[[Sir Hiss]] of the [[Robin Hood (film)|1973 ''Robin Hood ''film]] is heavily based on (and is often confused with) Kaa, having both similar head design and hypnotic powers.\n*Though Kaa was not one of the ringleader villains in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', he is featured on the cover of the DVD and VHS. However, he does assist in kicking Mickey and [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] out of the club.\n*Kaa is the only Disney villain voiced by Sterling Holloway. The other Disney characters Holloway voiced were protagonists (or anti-heroes, as with the [[Cheshire Cat]]).\n*Even though Kaa wants to eat Mowgli in the films, real life pythons do not usually view humans as a part of their food chain or prey in any way and usually do not attack humans unless threatened or provoked. Moreover, real Indian Rock Pythons are too small to eat a human; only the closely related Reticulated Python, African Rock Python, and the Green Anaconda are known to have tried to eat humans.\n*In the second level of the ''[[Little Einsteins]]'' online game \"Quincy and the Magic Instruments\", the saxophone changes into a snake resembling Kaa while the band plays.\n*The decision to make Kaa a female in the 2016 film was due to the need for gender diversity within the primarily male-driven cast of the 1967 animated film.<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/movies/jon-favreau-breaks-down-disneys-live-action-129130133927.html</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n*{{WP}}\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/b/bc/Favicon(2).ico|Villains|Kaa (Disney)|Villains Wiki}}\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[ar:\u0642\u0627\u0639]]\n[[es:Kaa]]\n[[fr:Kaa]]\n[[it:Kaa]]\n[[nl:Kaa]]\n[[pl:Kaa]]\n[[pt-br:Kaa]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0430\u0430]]\n[[sv:Kaa]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Article of the week]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Celebrate the Magic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Overtakers]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]"
