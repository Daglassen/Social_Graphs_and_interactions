You're that Link guy I've been looking for!|Master Kohga|BotW}}</ref> After defeating Master Kohga, he will use his last bit of energy to perform his \"secret technique\", which backfires and causes him to fall down the large pit in the center of the area.<ref>{{Cite|I need to bust out my serious moves...

In the first phase, Master Kohga conjures up a rock above him to hurl at {{Term|BotW|Link}}. Striking Master Kohga from afar as he levitates in the air, such as with a {{Term|BotW|Bow|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Remote Bomb|link}} or thrown {{Term|BotW|Weapon|link}}, will break his focus and cause the rock to fall on his head. This temporarily stuns Master Kohga, partially burying him in the ground and allowing {{Term|BotW|Link}} to attack him unopposed. In the second phase, he levitates above the large pit nearby and conjures up two rocks that spin around him. {{Term|BotW|Link}} must hit Master Kohga when one of the rocks is directly above his head, causing it to once again fall on his head and stun him. In the third and final phase, he conjures up a fortified boulder to attempt to crush {{Term|BotW|Link}}. {{Term|BotW|Link}} must use {{Term|BotW|Magnesis|link}} to gain control of the boulder and push it back towards Kohga. This will stun Kohga once again and give {{Term|BotW|Link}} the opportunity to finish the fight. In all phases, he is protected by a blue shield which disappears when he goes offensive in the first two stages but remains permanently during the third. {{Plural|BotW|Ancient Arrow|link}} act like normal arrows when he is hit with one, and Master Kohga and his boulders cannot be stopped with {{Term|BotW|Stasis|link}} at any time. He is the only notable {{Term|BotW|Sheikah}} to display this, as even {{Term|BotW|Maz Koshia|link}} can be placed under Stasis.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n==={{SSBU|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n{{Spirit Battle\n|name= Master Kohga\n|spirit type= Primary\n|fighters= {{Stock|SSBU|King K.

He is later defeated but is saved by {{Term|HWAoC|Sooga|link}} at the last minute.<ref>{{Cite|Sooga, you're late!

Fate decides all...even this defeat. As you well know, if you decide to turn against me... ...you would make an enemy of Calamity Ganon.|Astor|HWAoC}}</ref>\n\nLater, after Ganon awakens on Zelda's 17th birthday, and the Blight Ganons are stopped from killing the {{Plural|HWAoC|Champions}} like they were supposed to in {{BotW|-}}, he objects to Astor harvesting souls from his men to revive the Blight Ganons, and is almost killed himself by a Hollow of Link, but {{Term|HWAoC|Sooga}} intervenes and tells him to run, stating that he would give his life to protect him. Kohga ultimately chooses to stay and fight alongside him. The outcome of the battle is unknown but is implied that {{Term|HWAoC|Sooga}} was killed. After Zelda has awakened her power and rallies the Hylians, he sheds his Hyrulean Soldier disguise and bows before Zelda, joining the Hyrulean forces in order to avenge his betrayed clan.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name {{Term|BotW|Master Kohga|display= Kohga}} is inherited by leaders of the {{Term|BotW|Yiga|display= Yiga Clan}}.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= CaC |publisher= |page= 369}}</ref> Together, the {{Term|BotW|Yiga}} and {{Term|BotW|Master Kohga|display= Kohga}} references the rival {{Wp|Ninja}} clans of ''Iga'' and ''K\u014dga''; this is mirrored by the {{Term|BotW|Yiga|display= Yiga Clan}} having a rival clan, the {{Term|BotW|Sheikah}}.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Master Kohga is the only antagonist in {{BotW|-}} to have any dialogue.\n** He is also the only boss in the base game\u2019s main campaign that isn\u2019t a Manifestation of {{Term|BotW|Malice|link}} bearing the title of Ganon.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Master Kohga Concept Artwork.png|Concept artwork of {{Term|BotW|Master Kohga}} from {{BotW|-}}\nFile:HWAoC Master Kohga Artwork.png|Artwork of {{Term|HWAoC|Master Kohga}} from {{HWAoC|-}}\nFile:HWAoC Master Kohga Icon.png|Icon of Master Kohga from {{HWAoC|-}}\n</gallery>\n\n===Video Gallery===\n{{Youtube|Qt4V5hayZ-A|200|Master Kohga in Untold Chronicles From 100 Years Past - Part 2 Trailer}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Bosses|BotW}}\n{{Categories\n |Hyruleans, Sheikah\n |bosses= BotW\n |characters= BotW, SSBU, HWAoC\n |playable= HWAoC\n}}"
