Analysis indicates it fears pure, shiny items and will {{Color|SS Red|startle at the sight of a sacred shield}}.\nIt is able to reanimate purely through its hatred of this world...and its attachment to outlandish underpants.}}\nUndead whose hatred accords them the ability to reanimate, Cursed Bokoblins take on a decaying appearance \u2014 with skeletal and bandaged arms, glowing yellow eyes, and chipped horns \u2014 and this is further exemplified by the flies swarming around them. They are primarily encountered in the deepest depths of the [[Ancient Cistern]], though they also appear in the [[Sky Keep]]. If [[Link]] is nearby, Cursed Bokoblins will emerge from the ground in large groups and pursue him, attacking by latching onto Link and biting him. In addition to dealing damage, their bite also places a [[Curse]] on Link.\n\nLink can exploit the monsters' fear of shiny objects by holding up either his Sword while it is charged with the [[Skyward Strike]] or the [[Sacred Shield]] (or one of its upgrades) to keep them at bay. Curse Bokoblins can withstand many blows before succumbing, and they often get back up. Using [[Bomb]]s will instantly defeat them, at which point they may drop an [[Evil Crystal]].\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\n{{Compendium/Extract|Cursed Bokoblin}}\nCursed Bokoblins appear in {{BotW}} as floating heads, similar to [[Bubble]]s, and are spawned from Malice. They are only found within the four [[Divine Beast]]s and [[Hyrule Castle]], charging at Link if he is within range. The only way to stop Cursed Bokoblins from spawning is to destroy the eye that is creating them.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\nCurse Bokoblins reappear in {{HWAoC}}, spawning when [[Stalkoblin]]s are defeated. They follow the player around and charge at them. Unlike ''Breath of the Wild'', they are not spawned from Malice and can be permanently defeated.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Bubble]]\n* [[Cursed Moblin]]\n* [[Cursed Lizalfos]]\n* [[Malice]]\n* [[ReDead]]\n* [[Stalkoblin]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{LivingCorpse}}\n{{Categories\n |Blins, Bokoblins, Cursed Enemies, Undead\n |enemies= SS, BotW, HWAoC\n}}"
