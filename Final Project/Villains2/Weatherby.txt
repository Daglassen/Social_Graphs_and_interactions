He is later present in several occasions during destruction of the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]'' battle between the motley crew and the cursed crew to which the motley crew managed to escape from the cursed crew's forces.\n\nDuring the battle at [[Isla de Muerta]], Weatherby was one of the three cursed pirates who stayed in the island with Barbossa, [[Jack Sparrow]], and [[Will Turner]]. During battle, Will and Elizabeth impale an oar on him, alongside [[Jacoby]] and Monk, all in their skeletal forms and Will places a bomb inside Jacoby's skeletal form in the moonlight, killing all three pirates trapped on the oar.\n\n==Trivia==\n*When the cursed crew was identified, Clubba was confused with Weatherby. It is presumed that Clubba was the one who died during the battle at [[Isla de Muerta]], but it is later confirmed that Weatherby was the one who stayed and died during battle, confirming that Clubba and Weatherby are separate characters.\n*Strangely, Weatherby was absent in ''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]''. Clubba, in this video game adaptation, takes Weatherby's role and has a striking resemblance to him.\n*His actor, D.P. FitzGerald, would later play a background pirate character named \"Bonesy\" from ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'', one year after the release of ''The Curse of the Black Pearl''.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Weatherby Weatherby] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Weatherby}}\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]"
