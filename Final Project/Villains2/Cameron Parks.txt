Parks''' is Chyna's high schooler brother. He tries to avoid Chyna and the other A.N.T.s due to their younger age and because he's afraid they will spill out one of his biggest secrets. Even though he's older, he spends a lot of time in her shadow. While she\u2019s a prodigy, he\u2019s not especially gifted at anything. However, he is determined to find something in which he excels at (Other than being famous; which occurred when his video \"Cameron Parks: Space Cadet\" went viral).\n\n==Personality==\nHe\u2019s not thrilled that his kid sister is at his school, so he tries to keep his distance. But, when push comes to shove, Cameron will step up to help her. Though more often than not, she even comes to his rescue. Chyna and her friends, Olive and Fletcher, constantly embarrass him in front of the other high school students. For example, Olive showed his blankie to the big kids. He does, though, stick up for Chyna where it counts, such as standing up to Lexi. Cameron is also kind of suspicious about Fletcher around Chyna. He is very interested in girls and considers himself a ladies' man, often flirting with girls. He opened a club called the ''\"End Hunger Today Club\"'' which only consists of he and Fletcher. Instead of ending world hunger, he uses school funds and donations to buy Fletcher and himself buffalo wings. He validates his greediness by saying that if he helps just one person, he's making a difference. He is also Olive's locker neighbor, much to his annoyance and irritation.\n\n==History==\nIn TransplANTed, he is upset that Chyna is going to his high school, although he later defends Chyna when Lexi says that Chyna was terrible and horrible. He tells her that she was his sister and he was trying to hear her sing. Lexi was shocked that he stood up to her.\n\nCameron is always eating food. In ParticipANTs, he founded a fraud club for his personal gain and all he did was eat buffalo wings. In his baby pictures, he always had a bowl of spaghetti on his head in 2 scenes.\n\nIn the episode The PhANTom locker he gets annoyed with Olive embarrassing him and tricks her into thinking that her locker is haunted. He later pretends to be a leprechaun ghost while doing the jerk to keep Olive away.\n\nIn SciANTs Fair, he and Lexi find Skidmore's cell phone and make some calls to stop teachers from giving homework/studying/etc.\n\nIn StudANT Council, he gets jealous of Fletcher hanging out with his dad too much and tries to bond.\n\nIn The InformANT, his dad gets him stuff from the evidence locker that he doesn't like.\n\nIn ReplicANT, he enters the Donkey King tournament against Olive and tries to stop her from winning.\n\nIn ClairvoyANT, he is dismayed when everyone but him receive Wacky Awards, so Chyna and Olive try to help him find his talent which he believes is psychic.\n\nIn ManagemANT, he accidentally uploads a video of Chyna singing on the internet instead of his movies.\n\nIn PhilANThropy, he helps Lexi after she unfairly wins a beauty pageant so he dresses as an old man.\n\nIn IgnorANTs Is Bliss, he enters Gibson's dog show because he broke Chyna's ANT Pad trying playing on a boxing app.\n\nIn Slumber Party ANTics, he enlists Fletcher to draw a comic book with him.\n\nIn America Needs TalANT, he, along with Fletcher and his dad, wait in line at a popular food truck for 2 days.\n\nIn You're the One That I wANT, he learns that Gibson has been living at school and offers to rent out his family's living room for him.\n\nIN PerformANTs, he tries to get backstage at a ''Blood Butcher'' concert.\n\nIn Ballet DANTser, he takes Driver's Ed with Paisley taught by his dad.\n\n==Relationships with Other Characters==\n===Chyna Parks (2000-present; Sister)===\nHe seems to be irritated that she moved into high school with him, he also thinks that it's not fair that she has a special talent and he doesn't. However, he will stand up to her whenever push comes to shove.\n===Olive Doyle (2011-present; Locker neighbor)===\nHe thinks she is extremely annoying, like in PhANTom Locker when she was trying to embarrassing him\n\n===Fletcher Quimby (2011-present; Friend)===\nHe is somewhat jealous because he has spent a lot of time with his dad, but otherwise, they are not seen together much, although they work on a comic book together in Slumber Party ANTics.\n===Lexi Reed (2011-present; Friend/Possible Crush)===\nThey are somewhat friends. For example, they work together in SciANTs Fair when they steal Principal Skidmore's phone.\n===Paisley Houndstooth (Kindergarten-present; Good Friends/Possible Crush)===\nThey are friends and are mostly seen together with Lexi.\n===Vanessa (2012; 2x-Girlfriend)===\nVanessa is Cameron's current and possibly first girlfriend.

But he found out that she liked him for who he was. In ANTswers, Cameron thinks she is an alien, but he reveals that even if she was an alien, he would always love her.\n==Trivia==\n*In PhANTom Locker, it is revealed that he has a blankie and used to have dolls.\n*In SciANTs Fair, it is shown that his cell phone has rhinestones on it.\n*He is a good dancer as he can do the Jerk and the Dougie, and other dances of hip-hop.\n*His middle name probably starts with an O, which is ironic because his initials would be COP, which is his father's job.\n*In America Needs TalANT, Darryl hints that Cameron barely finished 10th grade.\n*He's good at making movies, making it his real talent.\n*He once did homework for a 1st grader for $5.\n*He appears to be the only one in the school to not have gotten a \"Wacky Award\".\n*He can do 2 things, promise things he cant deliver and get backstage passes.\n*His locker has lots of clothes and accessories as seen here .\n*He was born on August 26, 1995.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nClairvoyANT3.png\nClar.jpg\nClexipl.jpg\n499px-Cameron and lexi.jpg\nManagemANT 12.png\nManagemANT 19.png\nClexi454384589834.png\n46991546.jpg\n011.png\n012.png\nCreepy.png\nGlitterpop.PNG\nLeaiseron.png\nCameronP.png\nClairvoyANT3.png\n493px-Lexi and cameron.jpg\nCameron4444848.png\nCameron6868688686.png\nCameron38548574974932.png\nNormal antfarm116 000140.jpg\nMm2.jpg\n432D5CCE-97FD-458E-BB45-BC04FA158BDC.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parks, Cameron}}\n[[Category:A.N.T.
