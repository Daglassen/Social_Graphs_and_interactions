"[[File:Wigglenog.png|thumb|250px]]The '''Wigglenog''' is a genie-like alien creature from the TV show ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]''.\n\n==History==\nIt has the power to grant three wishes, and much like a genie, is set free when the three wishes are granted. When the Hyperforce finds it, [[Chiro]] first wishes that they had some real action, [[Otto (Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!)|Otto]] wishes to be smarter, and the third and final wish is [[SPRX-77|Sparx]] wishing for an anti-Wigglenog bazooka to defeat the Wigglenog. But the bazooka ends up firing flowers because the rule is the Wigglenog cannot be harmed or wish to cause harm to it. Otto outsmarts the Wigglenog and wishes they never met him after faking him out with three new wishes.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!}}\n[[Category:Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Genies]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]"
