He appeared from the portal discovered from the museum. He makes his debut in [[Pharaoh Boy (episode)|Pharaoh Boy]].\n\n\n==Official Website Description==\nThe original boy king, who has found a portal into our world - in the museum. Pharaoh Boy is a total megalomaniac - like Romeo but with strange ancient Egyptian powers and a conviction that he was born to rule. He wants to take over the city and rule for all time - that\u2019s his one wish, and he pursues it determinedly. This is a boy king to be reckoned with.  <ref>https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pj-masks-season-four-springs-into-action-this-may-with-special-extended-episode-heroes-of-the-sky-301048467.html</ref>\n\n===Abilities=== \n<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NSRy4Kylk4&t=29s</ref>\n\n*'''Staff of Ra''': Controls people's actions, combines with other projectiles and shoots lasers\n*'''Saxophone''': Makes anyone move to his music without resisting\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{PJ Masks}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PJ Masks characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
