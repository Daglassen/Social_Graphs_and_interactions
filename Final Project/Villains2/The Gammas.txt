It is assumed the fraternity reforms to play fairly under Tank's leadership.\n\n==History==\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* One of the few named Gammas besides Bradley and Tank was Slouch (the one with the hat) who, despite not being more important than the other Gammas, had to be mentioned as part of their sports' team. Slouch also got a figure in the [[McDonald's]] collection based on the film.\n* A tall and skinny member of the Gammas looks like a shaved version of [[Bigfoot]] from [[A Goofy Movie|the previous film]], due to having the same snout. A conspiracy theory that they're the same character, but Disney likely just wanted to recycle a preexisting design.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goof Troop}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gammas, The}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Goofy Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]"
