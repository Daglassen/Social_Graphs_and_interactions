During the night, she is sleeping in {{Term|BotW|Hotel Oasis|link}}, whispering in her sleep that she will cure her husband.<ref>{{Cite|<small>I'll cure you... I'm sure I will...</small>|Malena|BotW}}</ref> During the day, she is in the barracks begging the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo}} soldiers to help her.

They said they have serious issues to deal with! They said they had no time for my plight! They turned me away!|Malena|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Malena}} does not blame them for avoiding a beast as dangerous as a {{Term|BotW|Molduga|link}} and wonders if it is foolish to expect others to help a stranger in need.<ref>{{Cite|But then, why wouldn't they? The {{Color|BotW Blue|Molduga}} is a menacing beast... None who face one escape unscathed...|Malena|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|So perhaps it's foolish to expect anyone to stick their neck out for a stranger...|Malena|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Malena}} is disappointed that she had to return to {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Town}}.<ref>{{Cite|I thought I'd finally gotten out of this town...
