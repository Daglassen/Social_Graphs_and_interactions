You don't know!!|[[Buford Van Stomm|Buford]] and [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]]|One Good Scare Ought to Do It!}}'''Suzy Johnson''', known as '''Little Suzy Johnson'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0232834/?ref_=tt_cl_t15</ref> by her neighbors, is a recurring antagonist of the popular TV show, [[Phineas and Ferb]]. She is the little sister of [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy]] and the daughter of Jack and Mrs. Johnson. She has a high-pitched squeaky voice and appears very cute and innocent; however, she is actually very manipulative and spoiled, always having to get her own way and will do anything to keep [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] away from her brother, as she sees Candace as a rival for Jeremy's time and affection. Due to comments given by [[Buford Van Stomm|Buford]] to [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]], it can be assumed she terrorizes him as well as Candace.\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:Char 45927.jpg|thumb]]Suzy, when around Jeremy and most people she feels non-threatened by, acts very kind, sweet, and innocent. When around others whom she ''does'' feel threatened by, however, usually when threatened, she acts very malicious and cruel. An example of this kind of behavior is to Candace, whom she feels threatens her relationship with her brother. She, therefore, has taken measures, such as putting squirrels in her jeans and training her dog to torment her.\n\nDue to this attitude around others, some neighborhood kids tend to fear her, evident in [[Buford Van Stomm]]'s mortal fear in her. He goes so far, due to her apparent behavior towards him, as to call her \"the face of evil.\" It appears, though, that she only acts this way around people she is threatened by, either physically or relationship with her brother wise.\n\nAs well as this, a reason for her hatred and cruelty toward Candace might simply be a need for attachment. It is common that a younger sibling to become so attached to their brother or sister that they are afraid of any possibility of separation from them. She shows this possibility by acting very loving towards her brother, even being held in his arms.\n\nSuzy as well as a much higher intelligence than most children of her age, evident through a large vocabulary and understanding of the actual psychosis she saw from Candace. She still tries to maintain a somewhat mindless and oblivious way of though when Jeremy is around.\n\n==Appearance==\nSuzy is a little girl with blonde hair and sky blue eyes.\n\n==Tormenting Candace==\n===First encounter===\n[[File:Suzy calling Candace.jpg|thumb|250px|Suzy calling Candace]]\nAs a small child, Suzy felt her attachment to her brother became threatened when receiving a call from Candace. Candace said she wanted to talk to her mom, but Suzy knew this wasn't the full truth. Suzy knew that Candace \"just wanted to talk to Jeremy\" and that Candace had a crush on him. So, she attempted to scare Candace off via the phone, informing her to not pull anything on him and that she was, \"and always will be Jeremy's favorite girl.\" When Candace came over later, she had her poodle bite Candace on the butt, then turned on the sprinklers making Candace slip and fall into mud and then used a remote control truck to spray mud into Candace face and hair. Candace. Candace then ran off. Later, however, after Candace \"developed\" the hiccups, Jeremy took her to get some water, and she snarled at Suzy, and Suzy was left still angry and also confused. (\"[[One Good Scare Ought to Do It!]]\")\n===Rematch derby race===\nWhile skating in the park with her grandmother and brother sometime later, Suzy encountered Candace again, this time being informed that the three would be racing Candace's grandma, [[Betty Jo Flynn]], in a rematch derby. Originally, the three were going to race Betty Joe and Candace's brothers ([[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]), but Suzy manipulated Candace to race by using her \"cuteness\" so she could further torment her, so she replaced Phineas, who became a commenter instead alongside Grandpa.\n\nWhen the race began, Suzy's grandma had a rocketing neck-to-neck start with Betty Joe, while Suzy stayed at a good pace. Noticing that Candace and Jeremy were getting close to each other, Suzy attempted to break them up, darting past her and causing Candace to spin out of control, but Candace landed in Jeremy's arms instead. The team set up to pull a whip, sending Jeremy forward, now neck-to-neck with Candace. Suzy activated the rockets she added to Candace's skates beforehand, and instead sent Candace rocketing backward along with Jeremy, pummeling into her and Ferb. At the end of the race, there was a minor dispute about who won, but both grandmothers realized that the time spent with the kids was more important than winning. (\"[[Crack That Whip]]\")\n===Picnic in the park===\nShe and Jeremy later went on a picnic and to play croquet in the park. Suzy did not know that Candace would be accompanying them. When she found out, at the park she took the advantage, starting the croquet game and sent a ball flying at the pie Candace was holding, splatting it all over her face. As Jeremy went for napkins, Suzy told Candace again that the favorite girl was her. When he returned, and Candace cleaned herself up, Suzy gave her a shaken soda can, splashing her when it was opened.\n\nAfter Candace cleaned up again, the three went for a walk, and Suzy took a nut from an elderly woman and [[S.I.M.P. (Squirrels In My Pants)|sent it flying into Candace's jeans]] as Jeremy went away briefly. Squirrels then went after the nut and into Candace's jeans, causing her to go off freaking out and dance uncontrollably. Later while stopping for ice cream, Suzy caused Candace to slip by hitting a croquet ball under Candace\u2019s shoe and fly into the ice cream vendor's cart and down a set of stairs which then crashed into a tree making a bunch of squirrels fall into the cart with Candace. Suzy finally scared Candace off by putting a squirrel in her face. At Candace's backyard comet party later that day, Suzy attempted to hit Candace with a ball while she was holding Jeremy's hand, but was stopped by a mound of steaks that fell on her (\"[[Comet Kermillian]]\").\n===Helping Candace===\n[[File:Gift for Candace.jpg|thumb|250px|Suzy when she is \"Off the clock\".]]Another time, Jeremy called Candace, asking her to babysit Suzy. Candace absentmindedly agrees, but by the time she realized what she was doing, it was too late, and Jeremy had hung up. Candace tries to get [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|her mom]] to help, but she doesn't believe Candace when she says Suzy is evil. Fearing the worst, Candace gets rid of anything dangerous in the house, (including the knives in the kitchen, their microwave, their blender, and even her old teddy bear) and wears a large, protective foam suit before Jeremy and Suzy arrive. Once there, Suzy suggests making paper dolls, leaving Candace confused. She explains that she only tortures Candace to control Jeremy, and that when Jeremy is not around, she is \"off the clock.\"\n\nOnce hearing that Candace cannot manipulate ''her'' brothers, she decides to help Candace in busting them for making a replica of Niagara Falls. She begins by demonstrating to Candace how to do it by getting some lemonade, to which Candace remarks, \"I have ''so'' much to learn.\" She then motivates her and suggests that she get her brothers to bust themselves. Candace succeeds in getting Phineas to call their mom, but as usual, their project disappears before their mom gets home. Candace asks Suzy if she has anything else to say, to which she replies, \"Results may vary.\" In the end, Jeremy comes to pick up Suzy, who asks Candace to hold a hose up to her face. Suzy turns the hose on, spraying Candace in the face and causing her to sigh and say, \"Guess we're back on the clock,\" while Suzy innocently laughs and cries, \"Splishy Splashy!\" (\"[[Suddenly Suzy]]\")\n===At the Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention===\n[[File:Ducky Momo loves you, too.jpg|thumb|250px|Suzy hugging Ducky Momo (Candace)]]\nSuzy is later seen at the Fantasy and Science Fiction Convention with her brother getting her face painted while Jeremy talked to [[Stacy Hirano|Stacy]] on his cell phone. Later, she chases Candace twice while she's dressed as Ducky MoMo. She wanders into an exhibit called ''Alien Nest'' and isn't seen again until near the end of the episode. After Candace reveals herself, Suzy hugs her saying \"I love you, Ducky MoMo.\", to which Candace replies \"Ducky MoMo loves you too, Suzy.\" This is the only time that Suzy does not act childish as a cover-up from Jeremy. (\"[[Nerds of a Feather]]\")\n===Other attempts===\nWhile Suzy was away at a friend's house for the day, Suzy's poodle continued Suzy's mission to torment Candace, biting her and peeing on her as she was over at Jeremy's for a \"date\". Likely, when she returned home, Suzy was very pleased. (\"[[Interview With a Platypus]]\")\n====[[Meap]]====\nIt is not known why Suzy fought Meap at a Bango-Ru convention, for that scene was removed from the episode, for unknown reasons. (\"[[Meapless in Seattle]] \").\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n====Jeremy Johnson====\nIt is not so common for a younger sibling to hang on to a far older sibling for attention. However, it is implied that she doesn't love Jeremy and only cares for the perks of her possession as little sister. (\"[[Suddenly Suzy]]\")\n\n====Hildegard Johnson====\nWhile Suzy may only hang around Jeremy for perks, she does seem to generally admire her grandmother. She has shown affection around her twice during \"[[Crack That Whip]]\" and \"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\" both times she has shown genuine affection towards her, the latter actually hugging her grandmother. Since Hildegard asked Suzy to compete against the Flynn-Fletchers, it is implied that she is at least somewhat aware of her granddaughter's darker persona. They also share a common hatred/rivalry towards someone in the Flynn-Fletcher Family (both from the Flynn side), Hildegard against Betty Joe, and Suzy against Candace.\n\n====Annabelle Johnson====\nThe two have never met on screen, but they are of the same family. Annabelle wandered off before Suzy was born, so it is unlikely that the two were even aware of the other's existence until Candace reunited Annabelle to the Johnson Family.\n\n====Suzy's Poodle====\nUnlike most of her family (Save for maybe her grandmother) Suzy seems to care a lot about her beloved pet poodle, she might have used some of her more darker tactics to train her, but sense the Poodle seems to love Suzy this seems unlikely. It is unknown if the Poodle obeys Suzy out of Love, Respect or Fear.\n====Mr. & Mrs. Johnson====\nSuzy has not been seen interacting with her parents much, but it is safe to assume that they are unaware of her darker personality. However, her mother did reprimand her after she confessed to trying to make Candace look bad before her and the Johnson family brunch.\n===Enemies===\n====Candace Flynn====\nCandace has grown to fear and loath Suzy. Suzy feels threatened by Candace being Jeremy's girlfriend, and has taken it upon herself to embarrass Candace in front of Jeremy whenever she is \"on the clock\". She also went as far as to train her poodle to torment her (i.e. using her shoes as a bathroom, and flushing her shoes down the toilet) (\"[[Interview With a Platypus]]\"). However, she also helps Candace in busting her brothers when she's \"off the clock\" (\"[[Suddenly Suzy]]\"). They also have a common interest, Ducky Momo.\n\n====Buford Van Stomm====\nSuzy is Buford biggest fear (He concerned his fear of giant squids in \"[[Voyage to the Bottom of Buford]]\"). He describes her as the 'Face of Evil'. Suzy might intimidate him over the fact that he is stronger than she is at the moment.\n\n===Other===\n====Phineas and Ferb====\nPhineas (and perhaps Ferb) are apparently unaware of who Suzy really is, Suzy was seen conning Phineas into some lemonade, and Phineas couldn't understand the reasons for Buford being scared of Suzy. the Fact that Phineas recognized who Buford has dressed as indicates that Phineas and Suzy are familiar with each other. (Phineas having no idea of her true self)\n\nFerb and Suzy have yet to interact, and due to Ferb's lack of speech not much is known about their relationship. It is unknown if he is aware of her nature.\n\nSuzy also seems to be aware Phineas and Ferb's daily projects. Suzy once tried to help Candace bust her brothers but they failed and she was amazed that they cannot be exposed.\n\n====Isabella Garcia-Shapiro====\nIsabella was confused about Buford's statement of the \"Face of Evil\", suggesting she is unaware of Suzy's dark personality (\"[[One Good Scare Ought to Do It!]]\"). Isabella did get slightly annoyed when Suzy said \"Whatcha doin?\" (\"[[Suddenly Suzy]]\").\n\n====Baljeet====\nThey have not been seen interacting.\n\n===Norm===\n[[File:Suzy Johnson-That's the Norm.JPG|thumb|250px|Suzy in \"[[Ferb TV]]\".]]\n\nIt is likely Suzy likes Norm as she was able to play with him while [[Jeremy Johnson]] tried to find him, be he didn't. (\"[[Ferb TV]]\")\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite her appearance during \"[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\", she had no speaking lines or role in the plot. All she does is give Candace a mean glare when she comes by and help Jeremy decorate for Christmas.\n*In Suddenly Suzy, Suzy and Candace become nicer to each other, and she explains that she does not need to make Candace look bad without Jeremy around. Suzy teaches Candace how to get Phineas and Ferb to bust themselves, however it was unsuccessful. This episode also implies that Suzy does not love Jeremy, only the privileges she obtains by being with him.\n*She is a fan of Seahorse Hospital, and Ducky Momo.\n*She and Candace are rivals, competing for Jeremy's attention.\n*Buford and Candace are the only ones who know about Suzy's hidden personality so far.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*\"[[One Good Scare Ought to Do It!]]\" \n*\"[[Crack That Whip]]\" (First Appearance)\n*\"[[Comet Kermillian]]\"\n*\"[[Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story)]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[Interview With a Platypus]]\" (Mentioned and Pictured only)\n*\"[[Let's Take a Quiz]]\" (Pictured only)\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Suddenly Suzy]]\"\n{{Col-2}}\n*\"[[Wizard of Odd]]\" (Speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Nerds of a Feather]]\"\n*\"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\"\n*\"[[Misperceived Monotreme]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Monster from the Id]]\" (Pictured)\n*\"[[Let's Bounce]]\"\n*\"[[Meapless in Seattle]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Ferb TV]]\"\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"200\">\nSuddenly Suzy paper.jpg|The few times Suzy is nice to Candace\nBufsusie.jpeg\nJeremyAndSuzyChristmasTime.png\nSuzy's evil grin.jpg|Suzy's Evil Grin in \"Suddenly Suzy\"\nSuzy angry.jpg|Suzy angry\nSuzyFakeSmile.jpg|Suzy's sweet persona\nSuzy in the race.jpg\nSuzy washing her poodle.JPG|Suzy washing her poodle\nLet's Bounce (2).jpg\nLet's Bounce (3).jpg\nTime for you to get yours.JPG\nVlcsnap-2012-07-27-17h34m25s217.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-27-17h34m33s37.png\nSee_you_on_the_track,_chump.jpg\nSuzyjohnson.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Suzy_Johnson Suzy Johnson on the Phineas and Ferb Wiki]\n==References==\n<references />\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Suzy}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n<!-- People have been adding the category, \"Villain\", she is NOT a villain and Isabella and Lego Liker has stated that adding the category will result in a block. -->{{PF-Wiki}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
