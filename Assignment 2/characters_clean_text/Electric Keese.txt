Fi's Comment:
Thunder Keese are similar to the fiery variant of Fire Keese, but differ as they have electrified bodies as their main form of defense. They inhabit the Lanayru Desert area, and like other electrified enemies in that region, they produce small bursts of electricity that will stun and harm Link if he strikes one while it is shrouded in electricity. Though Thunder Keese are weak, they can be dangerous in large groups as they may constantly electrocute Link, giving him little opportunity to defend himself. A safe and effective way to eliminate them is to use the Shield Bash technique, knocking them to the ground, then finishing them with the Fatal Blow.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Electric Keese appear in Breath of the Wild. They can be found in a variety of places such as East Necluda, Lanayru Great Spring and the Gerudo Desert. When attacking Link, they have the ability to shock him, which will stun him and cause him to drop any metal weapons he may be holding. Upon their defeat, Electric Keese may drop Keese Eyeballs or Electric Keese Wings.
