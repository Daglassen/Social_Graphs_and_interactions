At first, he orders Rex and Trixie to leave, but upon the insistence of [[Reptillus Maximus]], he allows them to enter and has them endorse Battlesaur weaponry. At the same time, he has Woody, Buzz, and Angel Kitty being taken as prisoners.\n\nHowever, the Cleric is upset that Trixie talks with Reptillus, as she may lead him to realize they are toys. As a distraction, he activates the dream elders' call for battle. He then takes place at the Arena of Woe as the arbiter of the combats, deciding of the life and \"death\" of the toys pitted against Reptillus Maximus, though they mostly fall towards the latter.\n\nWhen Trixie tries to save Woody and Buzz, all the Battlesaurs realize\u00a0she has the name of [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] on her paw, which\u00a0the Cleric (who suspected this earlier) identifies as \"the mark of obedience\", a sign that she has surrendered to someone. As a result, the Cleric deems Trixie unworthy of being a Battlesaur and an enemy. He then sends Reptillus after her when she escapes the arena.\n\nOnce the combats are finished, Woody and Buzz discover the Cleric's true nature as he prepares to dispose of them in \"the pit\", an aeration vane leading to a shredding fan. His plans are eventually foiled as Trixie succeeds to get [[Mason]] and Bonnie interested in their new toys, thus revealing to all Battlesaurs their true nature.\n\nAs Mason and Bonnie play with the Cleric, they release a pair of wings. Following this, it appears the\u00a0Cleric had a change of heart and enjoys their new situation.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTime4.png\nTSTTF-Cleric.jpg\nThgfd56.jpg|Cleric's redemption\nPixar Post - Toy Story That Time Forgot Sky-3.jpg\nFile.clericandtrixe.png\nSnapshot-2014-12-07 at 11_21_29 PM-1465503197.jpg\nZtthhdi3xexxa3xs8orc.jpg\nThe Cleric Figure.jpg\nRMKH3C.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* The Cleric bears a striking resemblance to the\u00a0[[wikipedia:Skeksis|Skeksis]] from the [[1982]] fantasy film ''[[Wikipedia:The Dark Crystal|The Dark Crystal]]''.\n* Prior to redemption, he was very similar to Lotso in many ways:\n** Both toys are antagonists, both use other toys as their minions, and both use a certain place as their lair (for Lotso,\u00a0[[Sunnyside Daycare]];\u00a0for the Cleric, [[Mason]]'s room) while children are busy or not present. The only difference is how they use it: Lotso uses Sunnyside Daycare as a prison camp, while the Cleric uses Mason's room as the Battlesaurs' tribe.\n** Both of them had a henchman who fell in love with a friend of Woody, Buzz, and Rex: [[Ken]] was Lotso's servant and fell in love with [[Barbie]];\u00a0[[Reptillus Maximus]] was the Cleric's servant and fell in love with Trixie.\n** Both of them also turned one of Woody's friends against the gang: Lotso reprogrammed Buzz and made him part of his gang, forcing him to lock up [[Rex]] and [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys, while The Cleric turned Rex into his slave against his will and also made him drop Woody and Buzz into the pit. Also, the Cleric is implied to have reformed in the short's ending, whereas Lotso has never reformed nor met Bonnie and/or Trixie (though in early versions of ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', Trixie was going to be Lotso's henchwoman before being replaced by [[Stretch (Toy Story 3)|Stretch]]).\n* In addition to acting like Lotso, both the Cleric and Lotso also parody [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]], the main antagonist of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga.\n** The way [[Big Baby]] turned on Lotso mirrors the way [[Darth Vader]] turned on Palpatine in ''[[wikipedia:Return of The Jedi|Star Wars: Return of The Jedi]]'', while the Cleric's voice sounds similar to Palpatine's. This makes the Cleric the second ''Toy Story'' villain to parody Palpatine after Lotso.\n** The Cleric also parodies Darth Vader as he parodies one of Vader's lines in ''[[wikipedia:Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', making him third ''Toy Story'' antagonist to parody Vader after Zurg and Big Baby.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Cleric, The}}\n\n{{PixarWiki}}\n{{Toy Story}}\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
