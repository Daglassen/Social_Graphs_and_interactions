In this book he also explained that he learnt all he knew from someone he described as a dear friend, although he was unable to recall the person's name.
During his life, Aurie Taamu was involved in a love triangle involving Ashai and Isha. It is unknown exactly what happened between the three of them, except that it ended badly and that Ashai and Isha remain single to this day.
