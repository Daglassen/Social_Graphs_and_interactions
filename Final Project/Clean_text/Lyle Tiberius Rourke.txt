breakdown and that shattered pieces while Cookie added that was transmogrified when Packard threatens whack him with her umbrella and Cookie immediately restates his answer simply missing Rourke appears briefly Donald Wants Fly watching Kida fly above his head quiet awe Rourke fight with Milo was similar the fight between Gaston and the Beast even having Rourke trying smash against him Coincidentally both Beauty and the Beast 1991 film Beauty and the Beast and Atlantis The Lost Empire was directed the same men Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and were released within roughly decade each other Lyle Tiberius Rourke the first Disney character divorced Initially Rourke scheme was deliberate part Whitmore plans with Whitmore planning selling the crystal the German military https www facebook com media set vanity AtlantisisWaiting2021 set 336671211406743 This scrapped plotline was referenced the film with Milo line about Rourke being mercenary nutcase who probably going sell Heart Atlantis the kaiser Rourke treachery and eventual betrayal were actually foreshadowed several times early the film When Whitmore shows Milo the photographs all the explorers will traveling Atlantis with Rourke photo the only photo that partially obscured with only half his face visible Also along with their photos are small sheets paper showing each the explorers profiles and biographies Since don see the other half Rourke face don see his profile biography all implying that deceitful nature Yet another clue Rourke betrayal includes some his early lines the film especially those containing either the words rich and money with the most obvious example this being his line This will rich ing for all Also shortly before Ulysses was submerging Whitmore seen crossing his fingers behind his back implying that did not take full trust the expedition led Rourke Also when the remaining crew members are forced evacuate the submarine Rourke the first enter the escape pods real life the captain always the last crew member evacuate sinking ship hence the phrase down with the ship this often considered disrespectful maritime culture When the crew allowed enter the city Rourke orders his soldiers stay behind the volcano base and salvage what they can which hints that covering secret agenda his own When Helga informs Rourke that there were not supposed people Atlantis and that changes everything determined Rourke replies this changes nothing implying that does not care whatever fate brings the Atlanteans This sentence however disrespectful against professional ethics and morality real life emphasizes pure ignorance the needs others After Rourke abandons all his teammates except for Helga along with Milo and the other Atlanteans Atlantis and Helga are leaving Atlantis with the crystallized Kida tells himself Barnum was right Barnum was famous American showman who was said have coined the phrase there sucker born every minute But historically never did Barnum was not the kind disparage his customers Rourke middle name Tiberius could possible reference Captain James Tiberius Kirk from the show Star Trek which Kashekim Nedakh voice actor Leonard Nimoy played Spock Rourke has least henchmen including himself and Helga given the fact that the Ulysses was supposed have 200 crew members the start the expedition and that half 100 the said crew were all killed the Leviathan attack and that only seven crew members Milo Vinny Moli u00e8re Audrey Sweet Mrs Packard and Cookie actually survive the end For while Rourke and much lesser extent Helga was the most marketed character from the film following Atlantis nowiki release and was therefore officially the most popular character from that film However Rourke popularity may only due the fact that the villain Before James Garner was cast Rourke other actors considered for the role included Tommy Lee Jones Jack Davenport Kurt Russell Heath Ledger Josh Brolin and Joaquin Phoenix the earlier versions the script during the final battle when Rourke uses the fire order kill Milo and accidentally breaks the glass window from the steel container where Kida instead trying swing the once more against him Rourke would have pulled out revolver and try shoot Milo the head upon which Milo would have shoved the piece the crystallized glass the revolver barrel making the firearm explode and backfire The shards created the explosion would have hit Rourke the eyes rendering him blind and prompting him fall from the balloon his death The writers decided rewrite the scene they thought was too similar Helga death Rourke the second Disney Villain have part book that the hero has and the part the villain has has something important and use for their own nefarious plans Rourke has page the Shepherd Journal from Milo Thatch which contains information about the Heart Atlantis the first The Bookman from Bedknobs and Broomsticks has the part The Spells Astoroth from Miss Eglantine Price for the Substitutiary Locomotion spell and the third Mittington Random the Phineas and Ferb episode The Klimpaloon Ultimatum having the second journal the Klimpaloon from Phineas Flynn Phineas and Ferb Fletcher Ferb which contains the map Klimpaloon Like Wilhelmina Packard Milo Thatch and Kida Rourke has his only appearance House Mouse Strangely enough for some reason does not appear the show tie film Mickey House Villains not even cameo and therefore the only three Disney villains featured that show that doesn appear that film all with the other being Scar and Shere Khan beacause they are abesnt During his final moments Eddie Carr scream during the latter final moments The Lost World Jurassic Park used twice during Rourke crystallization screams pain and when screams fright before blasted pieces the propellers the burning Gyro Evac Rourke scoffing Milo objections against taking the Heart pure rigid academics rather true real life good successful only education institutions such achieving CGPA person not good internships has failed secure lifetime career better have better working experience than perform better academically Like certain villains started off friendly welcoming and respectful person before turned out evil shares this trait with Clayton Lots Huggin Bear Miles Axlerod and Ernesto Cruz Rourke similar Clayton they both appear fine expedition leaders first but turn out evil However Rourke the more evil the was going steal the Heart Atlantis and didn care that the citizens would die without while Clayton just wanted sell the gorillas the zoo promotional
