They are united by the intention of bringing [[Dormammu]] to Earth. Curiously, out of over ten Zealots, [[Lucian|Lucian Aster]] (portrayed by [[Scott Adkins]]) is the only one to be identified, despite characters like \"Blonde Zealot\" (portrayed by Katrina Durden), \"Brunette Zealot\" (portrayed by Zara Pythian), \"Tall Zealot\" (portrayed by Alaa Safi), and \"Nervous Zealot\" (portrayed by Dean Ridge) being equally prominent characters.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Doctor Strange characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
