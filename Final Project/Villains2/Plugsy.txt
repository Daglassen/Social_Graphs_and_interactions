He tries to prevent his former allies, [[Toaster]] and\u00a0his gang, from\u00a0letting the Master ([[Rob McGroarty|Rob]]) take them\u00a0to college. When Toaster and his fellow appliances arrive at the Master's new apartment,\u00a0Plugsy pretends to welcome them. However, Plugsy and the Cutting-Edge Appliances trick them, and Plugsy himself kicks Toaster and his gang into a dumpster in order to force the Master to take him, Two-face Sewing Machine, Hand Mixer and [[T.V.]] instead. However, due to T.V.'s intervention, the Master finds out that his appliances are gone and rejects his mother's new appliances, saying he prefers his \"oldies but goodies.\" Plugsy puts on a disappointed face and is heartbroken over the whole matter.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nPlugsy (1).png|Plugsy greeting the hero appliances\nPlugsy (2).png|Plugsy with Two of the Cutting-Edge Appliances\nPlugsy (3).png|Plugsy with Lampy, Radio and T.V.\nPlugsy (4).png|Plugsy floating by a satellite dish\nPlugsy (5).png|Plugsy kicking Toaster out the window and into the dumpster below\nPlugsy (6).png|Plugsy overhearing humans talking\nPlugsy (7).png|Plugsy's defeat: the Master decides against taking him to college, disappointing him.\nPlugsy (8).png|Plugsy shutting the door with T.V. in the next room\nBrave-little-toaster-disneyscreencaps.com-8102.jpg\nBrave-little-toaster-disneyscreencaps.com-8346.jpg|Plugsy with T.V. with two of the Cutting-Edge Appliances\nBrave-little-toaster-disneyscreencaps.com-8349.jpg|Plugsy with T.V. and the New Toaster\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Brave Little Toaster}}\n[[Category:The Brave Little Toaster characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]"
