== Trivia ==

If Link rides the Lord of the Mountain to Quince, he will not acknowledge the steed, despite him having an experience with it.
If Link wears the Gerudo Set (or other clothing that can be worn with the Gerudo Top to disguise himself as a Hylian Vai such as the Thunder Helm, Sand Boots, or Snow Boots), then talks to Quince, he will briefly assume Link is female, though eventually he will realize Link is just crossdressing. This makes him one of the few Hylian characters outside of Gerudo Desert to react to Link's Vai Disguise.
