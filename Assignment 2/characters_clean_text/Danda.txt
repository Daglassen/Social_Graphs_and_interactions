Danda is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Danda is an elderly Gerudo who manages an Arrow Specialty Shop in Gerudo Town. She boasts that she has the best selection of Arrows available. Danda's daughter works all of the time, which means Danda has to look after her grandchildren, Kalani and Makure.
While she does sell Items herself, Danda will also buy from Link. She wonders why Link would sell such high quality items. Occasionally, she'll also remark that she believes one of her grandchildren will be excited to see what she's bought.
As Link shops, Danda asks what he thinks about her selection of Arrows. If Link buys all of one type of Arrow, Danda calls him strange for needing so many. After buying the last of her Arrows, Danda promises to restock soon. When spoken to after this, she comments on how long it took her to procure all of her products. Danda will remark that sheâ€™s never seen her selection cleared out so completely, before thanking Link and telling him that she thinks she should now be able to buy her grandchildren some new toys.
