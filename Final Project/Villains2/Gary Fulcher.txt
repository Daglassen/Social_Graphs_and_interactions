He is a fifth grader who often bullies [[Jess Aarons]] at school.\n\n==Role in the film==\nGary sits next to Jess in the classroom and often tells him ominously that he is \"dead meat\". He doesn't care about [[Leslie Burke]] at all.\n\nGary and his sidekick, [[Scott Hauger]], are later waiting for Jess and Leslie in front of the school to bully them, but have no chance to, as they enter alongside their music teacher, [[Miss Edmunds]].\n\nWhen Leslie tragically dies, Gary and Scott are overjoyed, and don't show sympathy to Jess, but up the ante on their bullying, going as far as to taunt him about it. He quickly retaliates and punches Scott across the room. However, Gary, being bigger than Scott, is later beaten up by [[Janice Avery]], who was sympathetic for Jess after Leslie befriended her. She gives him a nosebleed in return. \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-605.jpg|Gary watches Scott taunting Jess in class.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-667.jpg|\"He asked you a question, Twinkletoes.\"\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-4051.jpg|Gary and Scott are unable to bully Jess and Leslie, as they come in with Miss Edmunds.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-6583.jpg|Gary and Scott run past Jess in the hallway.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8424.jpg|Gary is stunned after Jess punches Scott.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8609.jpg|Gary and Scott trip Jess in the hallway.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8613.jpg\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8628.jpg|Gary has a nosebleed thanks to Janice Avery.\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[File:Bridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-7095.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Gary Fulcher's Terabithian counterpart, the Hairy Vulture]]The Hairy Vulture (a vulture covered in fur instead of feathers), one of the creatures that Jess and Leslie encounter in Terabithia, is based on Gary.
