The shadow is instructed to stealthily sneak into Scrooge's mansion and steal the dime by manipulating the shadow glass case. However, after mistaking the billionaire's moose head trophy for a monster, the frightened minion returns to her mistress.\n\nA furious Magica berates her slave for the failure, but theorizes that it was because the shadow was not strong enough. The witch prepares another spell to rectify this, but then changes her mind; feeling that her creation has already botched things up enough. The shadow, however, seizes upon an opportunity to lock Magica in a closet and completes the spell. Now transformed into a scarier shadow with red eyes, the usurper divulges her intent to get revenge by making people slaves to their shadows.\n\nScrooge is forced to seek Magica's aid after his own failed efforts cause the shadow to multiply into numerous clones. The shadow is lured inside of Scrooge's [[The Money Bin|Money Bin]] where a trap is sprung. [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] ambush the intruder with their flash cameras. With no darkness to escape to, the spell is broken and the shadow returns to normal.\n\n== Ducktales 2017 ==\nMagica\u00b4s Shadows appeared in the reboot of this series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nMagica's Shadow - Ducktales B.png|Given life.\nMagica's Shadow - Ducktales C.png|Carrying out her mission.\nMagica's Shadow - Ducktales D.png|Assuming power over her doppelgangers.\nMagica's Shadow - Ducktales E.png|Immobilized by Magica's spell.\nMagica's Shadow - Ducktales F.png|Final moments.\nMAGICA_SHADOW.png|As a badge in [[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]"
