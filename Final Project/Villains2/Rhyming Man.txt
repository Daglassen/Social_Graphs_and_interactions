He talks in rhyme as a parody of foreign villains' accents.\n\n==History==\nThe Rhyming Man first appears in \"The Atombrella and the Rhyming Man\", where he's a spy from an undefined foreign nation, who thries to get [[Eega Beeva]]'s invention, the Atombrella, an umbrella-like accessory which can protect its user from an atomic explosion. Unusual for a Mickey villain, he killed one of his underlings by strangling him (he tried to do the same to other before, but in that case survived).\n\nHe resurfaced in some [[Italy|Italian]] comics.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
