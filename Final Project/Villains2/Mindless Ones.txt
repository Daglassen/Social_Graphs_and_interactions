Mindless Ones are created from those who are willing vessels of Dormammu's power, such as [[Kaecilius]] and his [[Zealots]].\n\nThe Mindless Ones were created by\u00a0[[Stan Lee]]\u00a0and Steve Ditko.\n\nNot knowing of this, [[Kaecilius]] believed it meant \"becoming\" one with eternity; thus he kept calling his impending fate \"the Great and Beautiful One\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nMindless Ones SMASH.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Doctor Strange characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
