He is the first person the Boy takes Small One to sell. The Tanner is more than willing to take Small One off the Boy\u2019s hands; to skin Small One and make leather out of him.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Small One]]''===\nAfter a [[Roman Soldier|Roman soldier]] gives a [[The Boy|boy]] directions to a man who needs an animal like his donkey, [[Small One (Character)|Small One]], whom he intends to sell to, they enter a shop belonging to the tanner. The tanner is seen sharpening his knife until he hears the boy calling for him and approaches them when he sees Small One. The tanner examines Small One but when the boy asks if he will take good care of him, he reveals his true intentions and status, stating he simply wants the donkey's hide to make leather out of him; much to the boy's horror. Despite the tanner doing the best to offer the boy a piece of silver for his donkey, the boy refuses and both he and Small One run away scared from the tanner's shop. The tanner isn't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Tanner1.jpg|The Tanner sharpening his knife\nThe Tanner2.jpg|\"Yes?\"\nThe Tanner3.jpg|The Tanner approaching [[The Boy|the boy]] and [[Small One (Character)|Small One]]\nThe Tanner4.jpg|\"You have a donkey to sell?\"\nThe Tanner5.jpg|The Tanner checking his knife\nThe Tanner6.jpg|The Tanner examining Small One\nThe Tanner7.jpg|The Tanner examining Small One's hide\nThe Tanner8.jpg|The Tanner sharpening his knife again\nThe Tanner9.jpg|\"I only want his hide, boy.\"\nThe Tanner10.jpg|\"I'm the Tanner.\"\nThe Tanner11.jpg|The Tanner sharpening his knife for the last time\nThe Tanner12.jpg|\"One piece of silver.\"\nThe Tanner13.jpg|The Tanner's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tanner, The}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Semitic characters]]\n[[Category:The Small One characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
