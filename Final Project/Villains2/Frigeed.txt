When [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and his friends get inside the castle, he gets angry at their arrival, then he welcomes the gang. Aladdin suggests that he visits [[Agrabah]] to make it snow and Frigeed agrees. Later, [[Jasmine]] talks to Aladdin about Frigeed. She tells him the ice ifrit froze the entire city. When the gang tries to stop Frigeed, he creates two giant snowmen to help him put snow in Agrabah. He then creates a statue of himself, gets rid of the head, and gets in there to stick his head out so he can look taller. The gang tricks Frigeed into thinking that everyone in the city is bored of snow. They use a magnifying glass to make Frigeed melt, but it's missing a lens (which Frigeed is later tricked into creating himself), but the sun appears and goes through the magnifying glass, which makes the ifrit begin to melt. However, the clouds cover the sun and Frigeed refreezes, but [[Genie]] turns into a lightbulb and the ifrit melts again. He then turns into a cloud of water vapor and gets blown out of Agrabah by Genie.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is a pun on the word Frigid.\n*In both appearance, personality and abilities, Frigeed is very similar to the Snow Miser, one of the main characters in the stop-motion TV special\u00a0''The Year Without a Santa Claus''\u00a0produced by the Rankin-Bass Studios.\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
