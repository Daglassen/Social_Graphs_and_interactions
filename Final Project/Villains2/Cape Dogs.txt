They were to aid Scar in his scheme to kill [[Mheetu]] and [[Simba]] in a wildebeest stampede. The dogs were eventually replaced by [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]], whose roles were virtually identical to the one the cape dogs would have filled.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFile:Capedogs03.jpg|Concept artwork\nFile:Capedogs06.jpg|Concept artwork\nCapedogs01.jpg|Concept artwork\nCapedogs02.jpg|Concept artwork of the cape dogs who would eventually become Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed\nwilddog.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:The Lion King characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:African characters]]"
