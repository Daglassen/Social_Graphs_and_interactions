He was puppeteered by [[Allan Trautman]] and voiced by [[Tim Curry]].\n\nPurchased by [[Charlene Sinclair]] (with financial assistance from [[Mindy (Dinosaurs)|Mindy]]), the jacket is part of a clothing line which literally says \"I'm better than you.\" The newly acquired status symbol, which speaks with a snooty British accent, begins encouraging Charlene to reject her old friends, steal [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl's]] credit card and in general inveigles Charlene into a near Faustian bargain in exchange for temporary popularity.\n\nThe fickle jacket eventually wearies of Charlene and attaches itself to the more likeminded [[Heather Worthington]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSlave2Fashion.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-26-16h43m13s205.png\nHeather fox jacket.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}\n[[Category:Foxes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Articles of Clothing]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]"
