Gesane is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Gesane is a Rito guard who patrols the lowest entrance of Rito Village. He carries a Feathered Spear and continuously paces the bridge.
When Link first speaks to Gesane, he greets him and asks if he needs something. Link asks who he is, so Gesane introduces himself. Then, Link asks about the Rito, he recites a saying about the Rito and is surprised Link has never heard it. He encourages Link to visit Rito Village, should he have a chance.
After Divine Beast Vah Medoh has been calmed, Gesane will note that Link has come at a good time now that there is not anymore trouble. He asks if Link needs something, which Link replies to by asking how Gesane is. He can't complain about his life, but he suddenly reveals that he saw a Frost Talus when he went on a walk earlier. He clarifies that it is a giant monster made of enchanted ice, and he thought it was both incredible and terrifying. He thinks he saw it in Coldsnap Hollow,  but he ended up fleeing very quickly. Despite its size, Gesane believes a Champion could take it down easily. This begins the "Face the Frost Talus" Side Quest.
After Link has defeated the Frost Talus, he can return to Rito Village to share the news with Gesane. He did not believe a Hylian could take down something of that size. Ultimately, Gesane is relieved, since Rito Village could have been in danger if it had wandered towards it. As a reward, he gifts Link a Silver Rupee.
Gesane is still very shocked that Link managed to defeat the Frost Talus. However, the world is still full of other dangerous creatures, so he remains vigilant.
