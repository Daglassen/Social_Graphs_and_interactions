She appeared in the episode \"[[Rewriting History]]\". She is not to be confused with [[Shego]]'s alter ego from \"[[Stop Team Go]]\".\n==History==\nShe was hired by [[Bartholomew Lipsky]] to steal [[Professor Demens]]' invention, the Electrostatic Illuminator.\n\nShe is implied to be an ancestor to [[Shego]], but the relationship was unstated. However, since the entire episode but for the final three minutes was a dream, her existence as a \"real\" person is debatable.\n\n==Notes==\n*As with ''everything depicted in the episode'', except the final few moments after Kim and Ron wake to discover it was all a dream, it is highly questionable if Miss Go was \"real\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMim possible vs. Ms. Go.png\nMim possible vs. Ms. Go 004.png\nMim possible vs. Ms. Go 002.png\nMim possible vs. Ms. Go 003.png\nMs. Go Getaway.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Go, Ms.}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
