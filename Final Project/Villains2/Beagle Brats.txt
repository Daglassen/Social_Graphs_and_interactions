Seemingly their moral compass is not well-defined at their current age, as they sometimes can be as criminal as their uncles, sometimes are just bratty, and sometimes they do downright legal work like shoe-shining, much to their uncles' chagrin.\n\nNumerous similar young relations of the Beagle Boys appeared in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[Take Me Out of the Ballgame (DuckTales)|Take Me Out of the Ballgame]]\". They were also referred to as the Beagle Brats, although it is not specified how they are related to the rest of the Beagle Boys.\n\n==Description==\nThe trio usually known as the Beagle Brats are a set of identical hellions who are the nephews of the three main [[Duckburg]] [[Beagle Boys]]. The Beagle Brats are a handful even for their equally-immoral parents, who often shift their guardianship to said main trio who, in turn, have no idea how to deal with them. The Brats seem to have a rivalry against the [[Junior Woodchucks]], each seeing the others as their polar opposite.\n\nThough the triplets 1, 2 and 3 are usually the ones referred to as the Beagle Brats, there is evidence that any children of [[Beagle Boys]] who follow the family traditions at an early age can be referred to as Beagle Brats.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\nthe Beagle Boys appeared in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[Take Me Out of the Ballgame (DuckTales)|Take Me Out of the Ballgame]]\", The Beagle Brats are child relatives of the Beagle Boys, and numerous of them, all unnamed, faces off against the Junior Woodchucks including Huey, Dewey and Louie, Doofus and Webby in a game of baseball. Coached by Ma Beagle, they are shown to share the Beagle family's fondness of foul play, although eventually they lose the game.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nIn the episode [[Astro B.O.Y.D.!]], a character credited as Bully Beagle\u00a0is featured. He is a member of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] who makes\u00a0fun of Huey Duck, and is very similar to the Beagle Brats.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMa and Brats.png|Ma Beagle and the Beagle Brats in ''Take Me Out of the Ballgame''.\nMa Beagle06.jpg\nMa Beagle01.jpg\nBratsMa TMO1.png|Ma Beagle lecturing one of the Beagle Brats.\nBeaglesAndBrats TMO1.png|Baggy, Bigtime, and Burger as spectators with some of their younger relations.\nBratDoofus TMO1.png|A Beagle Brat smashes Doofus's glasses.\nBratMaDefeat TMO1.png|The team's defeat.\nBeaglebrats.jpg|Beagle Brats as they appear in the comics.\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brats, Beagle}}\n[[fi:Karhunpennut]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
