Merina is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Merina is a Gerudo soldier who guards the front entrance of Gerudo Town with Dorrah. When Link tries to enter Gerudo Town without a disguise, the guards will stop him from entering. When Link speaks to Merina, she notices that Link is a "voe," or a man, and warns him that men are not allowed inside the Town. Merina finds it ridiculous that Link does not know the difference between "voe" and "vai," yet he is trying to enter the Town. When Link speaks to her again, Merina again scolds him and reiterates that only vai, or women, are allowed. When Link finishes speaking to her, she exclaims that all men must leave at once. If Link speaks to Merina with the Gerudo Set on, she comments that they do not see many Hylian women around there and welcomes Link to the Town. Merina also explains that only women are allowed into the Town and invites Link to take his time there. She recommends that Link learns the Gerudo language if he plans on entering Gerudo Town. Before finishing speaking, Merina also recommends that Link orders a Noble Pursuit at The Noble Canteen, calling it the best drink she has ever had. If Link speaks to Merina after calming the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, she comments about how peaceful the Gerudo Desert is now and rejoices that she can get back to living her life now.
