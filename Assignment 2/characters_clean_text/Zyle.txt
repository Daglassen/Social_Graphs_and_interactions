Zyle is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Link can find Zyle standing near a Cooking Pot in the Gerudo Canyon. Link can speak to Zyle to begin the "Good-Sized Horse" Side Quest. Zyle is surprised to see Link and tells him that he was attacked by monsters, causing his Horse to run away and leaving him stranded. Zyle asks Link to sell him a Horse for 300 Rupees if he finds one for him so that he may continue his travels. Link agrees to find him a Horse and Zyle's only request is that the Horse is not too big but "suitably sized."
Upon returning to Zyle with a Horse, Zyle is excited that the Horse is just like his old one and asks if he could have it for 300 Rupees. Link agrees to sell the Horse and Zyle pays him 300 Rupees as promised. Before departing, Zyle expresses excitement about his new partner and the Side Quest is completed.
If Link talks to Zyle as he departs on his new Horse, he tells Link to say hello to him if he ever sees him on his travels. After this point, Zyle can be found at the Outskirt Stable in Hyrule Field.
