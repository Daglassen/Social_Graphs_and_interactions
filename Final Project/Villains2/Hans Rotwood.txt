He is voiced by [[Paul Rugg]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old_School_Training_(25).jpg|thumb|250px|Hans Rotwood in Season One]]He used to be a famous professor until his theories on magical creatures humiliated him in front of his peers; destroyed his career as a scientific researcher; got him fired from his job at Hoboken Science Institute; finally reducing him to teaching at [[Millard Fillmore Middle School]]. As a believer of magical creatures, he teaches a class on them, but due to completely incorrect facts, [[Jake Long|Jake]] is always confused and has low grades in the class.\n\nRotwood has a notable dislike of Jake, initially due to Jake's lack of respect. Rotwood eventually develops a suspicion of Jake and keeps a close eye on him.\n\n==Talents, Interests, and Abilities==\nAfter the departure of Principal [[Dolores Derceto]], Rotwood became Principal of Millard Fillmore Middle School in her place. He then worked to trick Jake into revealing himself as a dragon to him. He finally succeeded after a campaign to make Jake reveal his dragon form by humiliating him at school. While he finally gained personal proof, he was unable to obtain anything concrete enough to show others. However, in a brief truce, Jake gave him a personal look at the magical world by taking Rotwood to the [[Magus Bazaar]] where he was thoroughly delighted<ref name=\"enemy\">[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]</ref>.\n\nAlthough wishing to be famous for proving the existence of magical creatures, Rotwood appears to have a true affinity for them. During a trip inside Rotwood's dreams and memories, it is suggested he encountered a chimera as a baby, which may have been what started his life's interest in the magical world<ref>[[Dreamscape]]</ref>. At Jake's graduation, the two seem to have put their differences aside as they shook hands.<ref>[[Being Human]]</ref><br />\n\n==Trivia==\n*As of Season 2, Rotwood is revealed to be 47 years old<ref name=\"enemy\">[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]</ref>.\n*He is very similar to Denzel Crocker From ''The Fairly Odd Parents'':\n**Both want to prove that magical beings exist.\n***Crocker wants to prove that fairy godparents exist, while Rotwood wants to prove that all magical creatures in general exist.\n**Both were previously famous professors that were humiliated and demoted due to their belief in magical creatures.\n**Both act as an antagonist to their respective students; Timmy Turner and Jake Long.\n***Mr. Crocker knows Timmy has fairy godparents while Rotwood had personal proof that Jake is a dragon.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*[[Old School Training]] (first appearance)\n*[[The Talented Mr. Long]]\n*[[Professor Rotwood's Thesis]]\n*[[Body Guard Duty]]\n*[[Shapeshifter]]\n*[[The Ski Trip]]\n*[[Hong Kong Nights]]\n\n===Season Two===\n*[[Bring It On]]\n*[[The Academy]]\n*[[The Doppelganger Gang]]\n*[[Something Fishy This Way Comes]]\n*[[Breakout (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Breakout]]\n*[[Dreamscape]]\n*[[A Befuddled Mind]]\n*[[Supernatural Tuesday]]\n*[[The Rotwood Files]]\n*[[Hairy Christmas]]\n*[[The Love Cruise]]\n*[[Nobody's Fu]]\n*[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]\n*[[Furious Jealousy]] (mentioned)\n*[[Being Human]] (final appearance)\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Template:Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rotwood, Hans}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Principals]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
