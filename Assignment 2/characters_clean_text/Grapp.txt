== Biography ==
Grapp is an elderly Goron who is found at the Goron Hot Springs sitting in one of its pools. He dislikes being disturbed while taking he is taking his bath. Grapp expresses that he feels the water there is only lukewarm and would like to bathe in much hotter water, but is unable to due to the Magma Bombs ahead. He tells Link that he should stay away from the Bridge of Eldin as the area past that point is incredibly hot. However, he also admits that the Bridge is inaccessible anyway as Bludo had lowered it to prevent the Divine Beast Vah Rudania's advance.
If Link is wearing the Flamebreaker Set of Armor, Grapp will be impressed with him. However, he warns him to stay away from Vah Rudania regardless.
