He first appears when [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]], [[Genie]], [[Iago]], [[Magic Carpet|Carpet]] and [[Abu]] come in the jungle to get food for the inhabitants of Ziggarock. The Tyrannosaurus attacks them and tries to eat Iago, but Carpet comes to rescue him. He then strikes Genie with his tail and attacks the others, but Abu, whose a prophecy said that he is destined to be the liberator of Ziggarock, tries to fight the Tyrannosaurus. However, Aladdin tells him that its too dangerous and the group get out of the jungle with Carpet.\n\nLater, Aladdin imagines a plan to trap the dinosaur. Carpet puts a giant X on the ground, while Genie and Iago place explosives on the boulders above. Then, they go in the jungle to find the Tyrannosaurus, who quickly attacks them. They manage to lure him to the X and Genie detonates the bombs, exploding the boulders who fall on the dinosaur and bury him.\n\nAt night, the Tyrannosaurus escapes out from underneath the boulders and climbs the mountain to the city. He encounters a young boy and pursues him, but the boy manages to escape from the dinosaur. Shortly after, the Tyrannosaurus attacks the villages and the group during their feast and devours most of the food. He also accidentally destroys the statue of Abu with his tail. Aladdin and his friends try to distract him while the villagers escape, however the giant beast manages to hit Aladdin with his tail, then he destroys a house and the debris fall on Carpet, trapping him. Genie tries to intervene, but the Tyrannosaurus crushes him with his foot. He then comes toward Aladdin, however Abu suddenly jumps on and blinds the dinosaur with bananas. He also throws fruit at the reptile and manages to lure him to a cliff, and the Tyrannosaurus finally falls to its death, nearly taking Abu with it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nMaas096.jpg\nMaas097.jpg\nMaas098.jpg\nMaas103.jpg\nMaas09.jpg\nMaas100.jpg\nMaas102.jpg\nMaas104.jpg\nMaas111.jpg\nMaasdeath.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
