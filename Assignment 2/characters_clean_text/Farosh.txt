Farosh is a Dragon in Breath of the Wild.


== Characteristics ==

Farosh is one of three roaming Dragons in Hyrule, the others being Naydra and Dinraal. While it cannot be defeated, it does not actively try to harm Link. However, if Link gets too close, he will be damaged by the electricity surrounding its body, unless he possesses a full set of Rubber Armor that has been enhanced twice by a Great Fairy or the Thunder Helm for the Unshockable Set Bonus. Farosh will drop different Materials if Link shoots it with a Bow. Depending on where Farosh is shot, it will drop a Shard of Farosh's Horn, Shard of Farosh's Fang, Farosh's Claw or Farosh's Scale. After being shot, the dragon will disappear until the next in-game day.
Farosh's Scale can be dropped into the Spring of Courage to reveal a hidden Ancient Shrine.
