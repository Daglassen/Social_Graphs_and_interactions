Their members hail from what was once Corona's rival kingdom, Saporia.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the war between Corona and Saporia had ended in a romantic unity between its two leaders - and by extension, their lands - a small sect of Saporians felt betrayed by the merge, and swore revenge on Corona. Centuries later, this sect was mostly thought to have died out, though there were rumors that the decendants of the these Saporians still lived and waited for the opportunity to fulfill their ancestors' wishes and strike back at Corona. These rumors were confirmed true, when the daughter of Corona's [[Captain of the Guards]], [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]], lured [[Andrew (Tangled)|one of the separatists]] into the kingdom and apprehended him after he made a failed attempt to steal [[King Herz Der Sonne's Journal]], which contains Coronian secrets.\n\nOne year later, the separatists managed to take over Corona by erasing the King and Queen's memories and were joined by Varian, who was imprisoned alongside their leader. Soon, they were confronted by [[Rapunzel|Princess Rapunzel]] and her friends who have returned from their journey, but were quickly defeated thanks to Varian's alchemy. Later, Varian attempted to create a formula to erase the memories of the people of Corona but ends up creating an explosive formula instead which the separatists decided to use to destroy Corona from an airship, to which Varian betrayed them and helped Rapunzel to defeat them, and save the kingdom, and the separatists were subsequently imprisoned and trapped in bubbles, thus ending the sect.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Members of the sect wear a necklace with an emblem representing their cause.\n*In \"[[Rapunzel: Day One]]\", the emblem of Saporia is printed on the cover of a blue book of potion recipe.\n*The Nation seems to be loosely based on an abandoned idea from ''[[Tangled]]''. In the original version, Corona was at war with another nation because they assumed that they were the ones who had kidnapped Rapunzel as an infant.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSeparatists of Saporia Emblem .jpg|The emblem of the Saporian separatists\nThe Separatists of Saporia scroll.png\nRapunzel Day One 12.jpg|The emblem on the potion recipe book\nVarian7.png|Varian with the Separatists of Saporia\nImprisoned Saporians.png|Imprisoned Saporians after defeated\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
