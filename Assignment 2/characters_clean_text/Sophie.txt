== Biography ==
Sophie is the daughter of Seldon, a lifelong citizen of Hateno Village. She manages the Ventest Clothing Boutique, the Armor Shop in Hateno Village. She is a meek girl who stands in the corner of the store with her posture hunched because it makes her feel more confident. When asked about the Ventest Clothing Boutique, she will recite a slogan for the Armor Shop. Even at night, Sophie will assure Link that they are open.
Should Link decide to sell her something, she will take a moment before accepting anything he would like to give her. Sophie responds to anything sold to her politely and with enthusiasm.
