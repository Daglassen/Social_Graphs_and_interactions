Symin is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Symin is the assistant of Purah, the director of Hateno Ancient Tech Lab. When first approached, Symin offers Link a greeting and fawns over the shelves of research tomes in the Lab's possession. The assistant begins to wonder at the exact amount of books on hand, but is distracted by the sight of Link's Sheikah Slate. He requests to see the Runes on the Slate, which Link readily does. Although he examines all of the runes, he notes that Link appears to be missing some. After a moment, he realizes that he has not given Link his name and properly introduces himself. Before Link is able to return the favor, Symin correctly guesses his name. He explains that Impa informed him about Link ahead of time. Symin remembers that he must tell Link something important and turns to get Purah's attention. Link will ask Symin to clarify and the man realizes that he has not yet introduced Purah to him, motioning to the little girl in the room. He respects Purah greatly. He begins to explain the director's appearance, but realizes that maybe Purah should be the one to do so.
Link can then ask Symin about either the Sheikah Slate or the Lab itself. Bringing up the Slate allows Symin to explain its history. He expresses his pleasure with the knowledge that Link will use it properly, knowing the results would be disastrous in the wrong hands. Asking about the Lab pushes Symin to excitedly explain the purpose of the building. Eventually, Symin realizes that he is likely boring Link with his speech. He decides to put his words in a way that expresses the usefulness of their research plainly by giving the possibility of Calamity Ganon's full sealing.


== Nomenclature ==
