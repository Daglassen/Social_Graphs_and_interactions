Teake is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Teake is a Gerudo who is captain of the soldiers in the barracks in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to her, she questions what he is doing in the barracks and tells him to leave because they are on high alert due to a recent theft. If Link speaks to her again, she warns him not to make the guards any more tense than they already are.
If Link speaks to Teake after speaking to Riju for the first time, she initially tells him again to leave, but apologizes after Link explains that Buliara sent him. She continues to explain that the Thunder Helm was stolen by the Yiga Clan the other day and that the Yiga Clan Hideout is in Karusa Valley. Teake says that she was just thinking about requesting extra help and then proceeds to inform the soldiers to tell Link any information. Teake then tells Link to consider himself part of their unit.
If Link speaks to Teake after recovering the Thunder Helm, she compliments Link's combat abilities and asks if he will join the Gerudo forces. If Link accepts her offer, she laughs, but says that she knows he is on an important quest. If Link passes on the offer, Teake is disappointed but understands because of the important quest that Link is on. Either way, Teake encourages Link to reconsider his answer after his quest.
