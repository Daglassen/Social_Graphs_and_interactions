Chumin is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Chumin is a traveling Hylian merchant from Lurelin Village who travels with his Donkey, selling fruits and fish to other travelers. He can be encountered walking back and forth from Lurelin Village to the Highland Stable, where he sells his wares. He sporadically rests under a tree near the Fishing Resort or at the Lakeside Stable as he travels. When he sits under an awning at Highland Stable, he attempts to attract customers.
Chumin also mentions that, if he ever lost his Donkey, he's not sure if he could go on. He takes rain as a sign to rest.
When spoken to, Chumin describes Lurelin Village as a simple, sleepy town. He refers to All or Nothing, calling it a traditional Treasure Chest game and saying it reminds him of his childhood. When he's at Lurelin, he restocks his wares and claims to have won at All or Nothing.
Chumin spends a lot of time traversing trade routes, where he sells his wares. He's been traveling on the roads for years, and he thinks he could even be a tour guide. According to him, a lot of monsters hang around Highland Stable, so the area should be avoided. Occasionally, Chumin will give Link directions to Lake Hylia and the Finra Woods.
Chumin claims to have made many Rupees from satisfied customers. The first time he entered the Faron Woods, he didn't have a map and ended up getting lost.
Link can save Chumin from enemies. As a reward, he'll give him Rupees.
As he walks, Chumin tries to attract customers. He assures his customers that he has a lot of top-choice merchandise. When it's raining, he offers Hearty Blueshell Snails among his other products. Not only does Chumin sell his own wares, he also purchases Items from Link. He thanks Link whenever he makes a purchase. When Link buys his whole stock, Chumin thanks him for doing business.
