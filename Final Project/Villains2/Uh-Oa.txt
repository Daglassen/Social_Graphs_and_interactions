While the attraction had a very negative reputation in terms of quality, Uh-Oa's audio-animatronic was fairly well received.\n\nWhen a fire in Under New Management was\u00a0accidentally\u00a0ignited, the attraction was turned back into [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]]. Uh-Oa's figure would be incorporated into [[Trader Sam's|Trader Sam's Grog Grotto]] in [[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort]]. Uh-Oa would be given a new blacklight effect but have her animatronic functions disabled.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n=== The Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management) ===\nUh-Oa, Tiki Goddess of Disaster, functions as a representative of the Tiki Room's displeasure with [[Iago]]'s plans to change the Tiki Room and his general disbelief in the Tiki Room's magic and relevance. While [[Zazu]] tries warning him that his bad attitude will lead to his undoing, he doesn't stop, prompting the Tiki Gods to summon Uh-Oa.\n\nEmerging from a podium in the center of the room where the Enchanted Fountain was originally installed, Uh-Oa [[Uh-Oa's Song|breaks out into song]] as she unleashes divine punishment onto Iago before disappearing in a puff of smoke and letting the Tikis offer their own performance.\n\n=== [[Trader Sam]]'s Grog Grotto ===\nWhen the Under New Management attraction was restored to an abridged version of the original Tropical Serenade, the Uh-Oa figure would find a new home in Trader Sam's Grog Grotto. Here the animatronic became static and was perched at the top of one of the bar's back walls.\n\nIn the bar, a drink known as the \"Uh-Oa\" was created. When the drink is ordered, the bartenders start to chant her name as the lights flash, culminating in the figure's eyes glowing and speaking her signature line.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Uh-Oa and'''\u00a0'''Citrikua'''\u00a0'''are the only fully fictional Polynesian deities featured in the Enchanted Tiki Room.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nUh-Oa Trader-Sams-2.jpg|Uh-Oa at Trader Sam's Grog Grotto\nUh Oa Grog Grotto Concept.jpg|Concept for Uh-Oa's installation at Grog Grotto\n</gallery>\n\n{{Enchanted Tiki Room}}\n[[Category:Enchanted Tiki Room characters]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Polynesian Mythology]]"
