[[Iron Man]] engages Attuma while the other [[Avengers]] fight his soldiers. Attuma then heads into the flooded subways as Iron Man changes into his underwater armor to follow Attuma. [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye]] discover strange devices as Iron Man detects a lot of them underground, as they are set off in a plot to sink Manhattan by destabilizing the bedrocks of Manhattan. Attuma and his soldiers end up fighting Captain America, Hawkeye, and [[Hulk]], while Iron Man, [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]], and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] hold back the tidal wave with an energy barrier. Hulk charges towards Attuma as Thor helps to fight Attuma's soldiers. Hulk then engages Attuma, where they are evenly matched until Attuma punches Hulk through the energy barrier that Iron Man and Falcon created to hold back the tidal wave. Thor and Iron Man then attack Attuma, where their attacks could not harm them. When Attuma and his soldiers retreat into the oceans to find out why Manhattan is rising, they alongside Iron Man find Hulk holding up the island. While Hulk is buying the Avengers some time, the other Avengers fight Attuma, who then escapes into the ocean to prevent Hulk from succeeding. Attuma has the advantage in the water over Iron Man and Thor until Hulk gets angry enough to prevent Manhattan's sinking as well as throwing a large rock at Attuma. Attuma is thrown onto land as Hulk manages to defeat him. Following Attuma's defeat, Iron Man repairs the bedrocks beneath Manhattan.\n\nAttuma's advisor Lady Zartra and the [[Atlanteans]] with her are getting tired of Attuma's tyranny, and plan to use the Serpent Crown in order to use Giganto against him. After a misunderstanding between the Avengers and Lady Zartra's group, Attuma arrives with his soldiers and uses an eel to snatch the Serpent Crown, where he unleashes Giganto on both groups. With the help of Hawkeye using special sonic arrows to disrupt the control on Giganto, the Avengers reclaim the Serpent Crown, free Giganto, and defeat Attuma. As Lady Zartra and her group are now free from Attuma's tyranny, the Avengers contact [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to have Attuma extricated to the surface world to stand trial for his crimes against the surface.\n\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\n[[Spider-Man]] and the Avengers fight Attuma at the beach. Attuma is defeated when Spider-Man punches Attuma far out into the ocean.\n\nThe Grandmaster pairs Attuma up with Annihilus and Terrax against [[Collector]]'s team of Spider-Man, [[Amadeus Cho|Iron Spider]], [[Agent Venom]], and Thor.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''Avengers Assemble''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe Cabal.png\nAttuma-AA.png\nAttuma7-AA.png\nAttuma4-AA.png\nAvengers.Assemble.S01E21.jpg\nTumblr mt9c9oCrGZ1rl14rno1 1280.png\nTumblr mt9c9oCrGZ1rl14rno2 1280.png\nTumblr mt9c9oCrGZ1rl14rno3 1280.png\nTumblr mt9c9oCrGZ1rl14rno4 1280.png\nTumblr mt9c9oCrGZ1rl14rno5 1280.png\nTumblr mt9c9oCrGZ1rl14rno6 1280.png\nVlcsnap-2021-07-17-13h41m31s241.png\nAttuma.png\nAttuma AA 1.png\nAttuma AA 2.png\nAttuma AA 3.png\nAttuma AA 4.png\nAttuma AA 5.png\nAttuma AA 6.png\nVlcsnap-2021-07-17-13h38m25s125.png\nAttuma AA 7.png\nVlcsnap-2021-07-17-13h53m40s95.png\nAttuma AA 9.png\nAttuma AA.png\nThe Cabal AA.png\nThe Final Showdown 10 AA.png\nThe Final Showdown 1000 AA.png\nAttuma AA 10.png\nAttuma AA 11.png\nAttuma AA 12.png\nAttuma AA 13.png\nAttuma AA 14.png\nAttuma Hyperion AA 1.png\nAttuma Hyperion AA.png\nAttuma Hyperion Dracula AA.png\nAttuma Hyperion Modok AA 1.png\nAttuma Hyperion Modok AA.png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Ultimate Spider-Man''===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nAvengers Vs Attuma USMWW.png\nAvengers Vs Attuma USMWW 1.png\nAttuma Terrax Annihilus USMWW.png\nAttuma USMWW.png\nThe Bad Guys Won USMWW.png\nContest of the Champions, Part Four USMWW 2.png\nAttuma Terrax Annihilus USMWW 1.png\nAttuma Terrax Annihilus USMWW 2.png\nAttuma USMWW 1.png\nAttuma USMWW 2.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Comics===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAttuma (Earth-616) from Marvel War of Heroes 001.jpg\n3368930-attuma.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Mermen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
