She wields a {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Spear|link}} When {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} tries to enter Gerudo Town without a {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Set|link|display=disguise}}, the guards will stop him. Dorrah will tell him that no \"voe\" are allowed in Town.<ref>{{Cite|Freeze! Where do you think you're going?! Not into town\u2014that's for sure! No voe allowed. Off with you!|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref> She apologizes if Link speaks to her and says that it is a strict tradition that \"voe\" are not permitted into the Town,<ref>{{Cite|Sav'otta. Sorry, but in Gerudo Town it is tradition that voe are not permitted entry. We honor that tradition very strictly.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref> suggesting that Link instead go to the {{Term|BotW|Kara Kara Bazaar|link}} if he needs to prepare for a journey.<ref>{{Cite|If you need to prepare for a journey, you should head to the oasis near the desert's entrance, {{Color|BotW Blue|Kara Kara Bazaar}}.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Sorry, but {{Color|BotW Blue|voe}} are not allowed in town. If you need to prepare for your journey, you can do so elsewhere. Try {{Color|BotW Blue|Kara Kara Bazaar}}, the oasis at the entrance of the desert. {{Color|BotW Blue|Voe}} are welcome there.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link mishears \"voe\" as \"boe,\" Dorrah corrects him, explaining that \"voe\" means \"man\" in [[Hylian Language|Hylian]].<ref>{{Cite|Not \"boe\"! {{Color|BotW Blue|Voe}}! Bite your bottom lip as you say it. It translates as \"man\" in your language.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref> Dorrah also explains that the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo (Language)|link}} word for \"woman\" is \"vai\".<ref>{{Cite|So long as we're on the subject, {{Color|BotW Blue|vai}} is our word for \"woman.\" What do you think? Pretty easy to remember?|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref> When Link finishes speaking to Dorrah, she tells him that \"Good-bye\" is \"sav'orq\" in Gerudo.<ref>{{Cite|Since you're here, it might be worth it to learn some Gerudo words, right? \"Good-bye\" is {{Color|BotW Blue|sav'orq}}.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link tries to sneak into Gerudo Town without using one of the three entrances or removes any piece of his disguise while in the Town, Dorrah will yell that a man has been detected and commands the soldiers to capture him at once.<ref>{{Cite|Sound the alarm! A voe has been detected! Capture him at once!|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref> Link is then thrown out to the front entrance of the Town, where Dorrah points her Gerudo Spear at Link and tells him that men are forbidden by Gerudo law.<ref>{{Cite|Voe are forbidden from entering this town. This is Gerudo law. Do you understand? Never come back!|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce Link obtains the Gerudo Set, he can speak to Dorrah again. She explains that Gerudo Town is {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Kingdom|link|display=Hyrule's}} largest trade hub and that only \"vai\" are permitted to enter.<ref>{{Cite|This is {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}}, Hyrule's largest trade hub.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Only {{Color|BotW Blue|vai}} are permitted entry within the walls, and we're constantly on alert for anyone who looks suspicious.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|This place is famous for its bustling trade, but also for our unusual rule allowing only {{Color|BotW Blue|vai}} into the town. We're constantly on the lookout for anyone suspicious, so you can rest easy here.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref> When Link mishears \"vai\" as \"bai,\" Dorrah corrects him and explains that \"vai\" means \"woman\" in Hylian.<ref>{{Cite|Not \"vai\"! {{Color|BotW Blue|Vai}}!

The town can finally rest easy with that threat handled...|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Now you can truly relax in town. Feel free to come inside.|Dorrah|BotW}}</ref> She expects there to be more traffic in and out of Gerudo Town, which means she'll have to be more diligent to keep men from entering.<ref>{{Cite|I'm sure we'll see more business traffic going in and out than we have in a long while, too.
