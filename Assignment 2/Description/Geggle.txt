Sometime prior to {{Term|BotW|Link|link|display=Link's}} arrival at the {{Term|BotW|Stable|link}}, he and {{Term|BotW|Chork|link}} went to investigate the platform at {{Term|BotW|Washa's Bluff|link}}, but they couldn't figure it out.<ref>{{Cite|Go way out south of here, and you'll find a flat hill called {{Color|BotW Blue|Washa's Bluff}}. On that hill, there's this mysterious-lookin' platform thingie... Me and Geggle tried all day to figure out what it does, but we're stumped...|Chork|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can find Geggle on the cliff behind the Stable, staring up at the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Highlands|link}}. When Link first speaks to him, he asks what he needs.<ref>{{Cite|Hmm?<br>What is it, my smart man?|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> If Link wants to know what he's looking at,<ref>{{Cite|[Whatcha looking at?] Hmm... What could it be?|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> He points out a section of the cliff face that appears to be mane-made,<ref>{{Cite|I happened to notice that a section of the cliff face there in the distance looks almost man-made.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> He asks if Link can see it too, and while he would check it out if he could, he can't make it there on his own.<ref>{{Cite|My smart man, tell me... You can see it too, yes? I would take a closer look if I could get there on my own.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> This initiates the \"{{Term|BotW|Cliffside Etchings|link}}\" {{Term|BotW|Shrine Quest|link}}.\n\nWhen spoken to again after this, Geggle recognizes Link.<ref>{{Cite|Ah, well if it isn't my smart man.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> Once more, he points out the strange section of the cliff,<ref>{{Cite|That section of cliff, off in the distance... It almost looks man-made, no?|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> claiming he would investigate if he had the energy of an adventurer.<ref>{{Cite|If I was as chock-full of energy as an adventurer, I would climb that cliff and take a closer look in a heartbeat.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref>\n\nGeggle returns to the cliff even after Link has finished the Shrine Quest, where he looks for something to pique his curiousity.<ref>{{Cite|I'm in the market for a little something to pique my curiosity, so I spend my time gazing into the horizon.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> However, he's disappointed when nothing happens,<ref>{{Cite|Another day come and gone. No excitement to speak of.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> and he admits that he is trying to pass the time.<ref>{{Cite|Just passing the time...looking off into the distance.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the night, Geggle sits inside the Stable. He wonders when he got so old,<ref>{{Cite|When did I get so old?|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> and if he was still young, he would be off exploring.<ref>{{Cite|If I still had my youth, I'd be off in a flash, in search of something... fascinating.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref> He feels trapped by his age, as the only thing he can do is stare off into the distance.<ref>{{Cite|But this prison of old bones has condemned me to a short future of staring off into the unknown.|Geggle|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Hylian|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Tabantha Bridge Stable|link}}\n* \"{{Term|Series|Cliffside Etchings|link}}\"\n* {{Term|Series|Banji|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Chork|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Dabi|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Ena|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Kenyo|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Sho|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
