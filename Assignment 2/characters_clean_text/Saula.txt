Saula is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Saula is a Gerudo who manages the Armor Shop, Fashion Passion, in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to her, she compliments him for his Gerudo Top and encourages him to try out more colors. If Link asks about the different colors, Saula expresses surprise that he does not know and explains that dyeing clothing is popular for "young vai" right now. She goes on to tell Link about the Kochi Dye Shop in Hateno Village where he can dye his Armor. However, she states that not many get to travel there due to its large distance from Gerudo Town. Saula also states that it is hot and expresses her desire to get a cold drink at The Noble Canteen.
Through the doorway behind Fashion Passion is a curtain that conceals an entrance to the Gerudo Secret Club. If Link attempts to enter, Saula stops him, telling him that the doorway is not for customers. Saula then whispers to Link and tells him to use the door on the side of the building if he is a member. Saula knows about the Gerudo Secret Club, and is likely a member, as suggested by Yaido if Link eavesdrops on the Gerudo in The Noble Canteen. Yaido reveals that she overheard Saula say that the password to enter the Gerudo Secret Club is "GSCâ™¦."
