== Biography ==

Granté is a half-Hylian, half-Sheikah merchant.[citation needed] He is the son of the researchers Robbie and Jerrin. On the day his father suggested he should explore the outside world, Granté left his family home, the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab, and traveled the world whilst studying Armor before settling in Tarrey Town. He appears in Tarrey Town after the "From the Ground Up" Side Quest is complete and will sell Armor Sets to Link that have no other method of being replaced after being sold, such as Expansion Pass Armor Sets or those found within Ancient Shrines. He will also sell Link a new Hylian Shield for 3,000 Rupees if the original is lost or broken.
