She is the [[Olympian Gods|Olympian demi-goddess]] of Vengeance, and the Head of the Infernal Retribution Service whose main duty is to smite all and any mortal who disgusts, defies and/or disrespects the [[Olympian Gods]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nNemesis is incredibly devoted to her duties and enjoys the thrill of the hunt and smiting, becoming incredibly frustrated and impatient on missions that require only a tracking skill rather than her fighting ability.\n\nEmploying the ability to shape-shift her hands into weapons as well as various super-senses, Nemesis is an incredibly terrifying foe on the battlefield. \n\n==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==\nIn \"[[Hercules and the King For a Day]],\" after Pan, king of the satyrs, fails to give offerings to [[Demeter]], Nemesis is instructed to impose divine retribution to Pan. However, Pan tricks [[Philoctetes]] into taking his place as the king, and Nemesis, being unaware of the switch, attempts to smite Phil instead of him.\n\nLuckily, Nemesis is then thwarted by Hercules and Demeter.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Romans]],\" while Hercules was searching for a missing [[Icarus]] during a weekend, who was actually in Rome, [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] orders Nemesis to help Hercules find Icarus. Hence, finding Icarus pretending to be a god in the Eternal City, Nemesis attempts relentlessly to smite him there because of it.\n\nThe Greek deities and Hercules himself once again stop her.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nNemesis2.jpg\nNemesis3.jpg\nNemesis4.jpg\nNemesis5.jpg\nHerculesAd002.jpg|Print ad for the series featuring Nemesis\nNemesis6.jpg\nNemesis7.jpg\nNEMESIS DISNEY.jpg\nNEMESIS DISNEY 2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Nemesis is voiced by [[Linda Hamilton]], who is best known for her role of Sarah Connor of the Terminator franchise. Nemesis has the ability to create various weapons by shapeshifting her arms, Ironically Hamilton would face against the T-1000, a terminator that could do the same.\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Demigods and Demigoddesses]]"
