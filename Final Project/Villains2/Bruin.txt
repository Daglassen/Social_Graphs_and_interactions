When he asked [[Chip and Dale]] what they were doing with his last peanut, they told him they thought it was from the elephants' pile.\n\nKnowing such information, he called out the monkeys: [[Heebee & Jeebee]] to have a talk with the elephants. Using the tree in his pen as a bridge, he was able to reach the elephant pen. He and [[Captain Colonel]] fought over who owns the peanuts. Later, despite finding the idea of using the Rescue Rangers to help them a joke since they were very small, Bruin and the other zoo animals gave them a chance; thanks to the Captain's son, [[Elliott (Chip 'n Dale)|Elliott]].\n\nAt night, after the elephants' nuts have been stolen, Bruin, the elephants, and the monkeys accuse the Rescue Rangers of such a crime and try to stop them. When trying to harm them with his claws, Bruin only manages to get himself knocked down on the head with a bowl by Monterey Jack.\n\nThen, after the real thieves \u2013 who turn out to be the panda twins: [[Ting-a-Ling & Ming-Ting|Ting-a-Ling and Ming-Ting]] who only stole peanuts to make their digging machine work to dig back to China because they missed their parents so much \u2013 are discovered, the digging machine goes out of control by the chipmunks, and Bruin, the monkeys, and a [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]] end up falling in a hole caused by the machine's digging and later resurface after being frightened by the crocodile, who managed to bite Bruin on the rear.\n\nAfter the Rescue Rangers help recover the peanuts, Bruin is last seen enjoying some peanuts of his own.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bruin is a folk term used for brown bears (from the Dutch term \"bruin\" meaning \"brown\").\n*Bruin bears a resemblance to\u00a0[[Br'er Bear]] from ''[[Song of the South]],''\u00a0[[Humphrey the Bear]]\u00a0along with a striking resemblance to [[Baloo]], especially his [[TaleSpin]] portrayal.\n*At some points, Bruin is seen with his belly colored light brown, but without the chest. At another point, Bruin is seen with a pink nose when laughing continuously with the monkeys about finding the idea of using the Rescue Rangers to help them find their missing peanuts a joke.\n*At one point, Bruin's tree, which he frequently uses as a bridge between his pen and that of the elephants', seems short and wiggly but then appears larger, taller, and straighter the rest of the way.\n*In some scenes, Bruin's claws appear longer like as though they were his fingers instead.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nbruin1.png\nbruin2.png\nVlcsnap-2015-04-17-00h15m58s063.png\nbruin3.png\nThen look to those sinister-looking Simians behind you!.png\nbhb1.png\nbhb2.png\nbhb3.png\nbruin4.png\nBruin5.png\nbruin6.png\nbruin7.png\nbruin8.png\nbhb4.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
