However, during his search, Gruve neglected his duties and fell asleep on the spot where the [[Lanayru Tower]] was buried. When [[Link]] activated the [[Great Plateau Tower]], the Lanayru Tower rose in unison with it, causing Gruve to be carried to the top of the Lanayru Tower, where he has been stuck. If Link speaks to Gruve atop the Lanayru Tower before speaking to Sidon, Gruve will explain his plight to him.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|WOW! I cannot believe it! *ahem* Excuse me! Yes, you!}} I am {{Color|BotW Blue|Gruve}} of the Zora! It is apparent that you are a traveler, but may I ask what brought you here? [I could ask the same!] Hm... How very astute of you! An excellent query indeed! I, by order of {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} of Zora's Domain, and searching for a Hylian. Or I was...but then I fell asleep. I awoke to a loud noise and awful quaking, and now here I am. I'd like to get down and be on my way, but I'm simply too up high! I need to figure something out. {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} is down at the bridge below, but for some reason I cannot seem to catch his attention! But you! You are a Hylian, yes?! Well then! My luck is improving!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> Having found a Hylian, Gruve will call down to Sidon on [[Inogo Bridge]], though his calls fall on deaf ears.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|{{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}}! I found one! I FOUND A HYLIAN!!}} ...|Gruve|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Hmm... {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} doesn't seem to notice my struggle...|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> Gruve will weigh the option of jumping down into the waters surrounding the Lanayru Tower, only to decide it would be fatal for him to try.<ref>{{Cite|Perhaps I should swallow my fear and jump to the river below. Then I could return to him! He must be worried sick. ... ... No! Nope! Can't do it! I'm too high up. I'll likely meet the gods of the ever after before I ever see {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} again... Mr. Hylian, I must apologize... It will be some time before I can get back to {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}}. Please, you must leave me here and go on ahead.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> Speaking to Gruve again will lead him to accuse Link of trying to push him off of the [[Sheikah Tower]].<ref>{{Cite|Ha ha! You... Did you just try to push me? No, I assume? Well, in any case... Mr. Hylian, I must apologize. It will be some time before I can get back to {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}}. Please, you must leave me here and go on ahead. I will find a way to get my message of distress to him... Or so I hope.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter Link speaks to Sidon for the first time, Gruve will return to [[Zora's Domain]] and stand over the waterfall to the northwest of the [[Goddess Statue]], peering down into the water below. If Link speaks to him after previously meeting him atop the Lanayru Tower, Gruve will reintroduce himself and explain that he managed to jump from the [[Sheikah Tower]] into the [[Zora River]].<ref>{{Cite|Oh! You! Hi! It's me! I'm the one {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} left at the top of the tower! The name's Gruve! In the end, I wasn't able to join up with {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}}... Instead, I worked up some fighting spirit and jumped into {{Color|BotW Blue|Zora River}} from the top of the tower.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> If Link hasn't spoken to Gruve prior to speaking to Sidon, Gruve will then explain his situation atop the Lanayru Tower and how he was able to return.<ref>{{Cite|Hey. Oh! A Hylian! You are a Hylian, aren't you?! Sorry I didn't introduce myself sooner. I'm Gruve. I used to help {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} with his search for a Hylian. For you to find him yourself is a godsend! Yes, it is! However, while searching for a Hylian, {{Color|BotW Red|Prince Sidon}} left me stranded on a tower... Instead, I worked up some fighting spirit and jumped into {{Color|BotW Blue|Zora River}} from the top of the tower. Then I came here.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> In either event, Gruve will explain that he saw his reflection during his jump from the Tower and later developed a philosophy that a person is at their most beautiful when diving into water.<ref>{{Cite|Then I came back here. I was...deeply moved seeing my reflection on the water's surface as I dove in... Yes. Deeply moved. [Deeply moved?] It is my observation that a person's true colors shine the brightest when they dive freely into the waves!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> Gruve will then invite Link to return to him to show his beautiful diving form after he has learned to ascend waterfalls.<ref>{{Cite|So lately, I've been spending my days scouting out diving spots. When you learn how to {{Color|BotW Red|climb waterfalls}}, please show me your beautiful form.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> If pressed further, Gruve will explain that when equipped with [[Zora Armor]], Hylians are capable of climbing waterfalls much like an actual Zora.<ref>{{Cite|[Climb waterfalls?] Equipped like a normal Hylian, you can't experience the joy of climbing waterfalls. But with the {{Color|BotW Red|Zora armor}} that our princesses are known to make... Well, that's a completely different story.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> Gruve will also explain that his favorite diving spot is [[Shatterback Point]], though the [[Lynel]] patrolling [[Ploymus Mountain]] makes it a dangerous trip.<ref>{{Cite|[Diving spot?] My favorite diving spot of late is {{Color|BotW Blue|Shatterback Point}} at the tip of {{Color|BotW Blue|Ploymus Mountain}}. I can scarcely put it into words...the joy of your own reflection when diving into {{Color|BotW Blue|East Reservoir Lake}} from there... However, a {{Color|BotW Blue|Lynel}} does reside on {{Color|BotW Blue|Ploymus Mountain}}. If you go, be prepared for the worst.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref>\n\nUpon receiving the [[Zora Armor]] from [[King Dorephan]], Gruve asks Link to dive down the waterfall, tasking him with the \"[[Diving is Beauty!]]\" [[Side Quest]].<ref>{{Cite|Congratulations on the new {{Color|BotW Blue|Zora armor}}. It is most impressive indeed. Wearing the {{Color|BotW Blue|Zora armor}}, even a Hylian like you can {{Color|BotW Red|climb a waterfall}} and get back up here in no time at all. That said, if you don't mind me asking, would you please show me your true colors as you dive into the water? You can dive {{Color|BotW Red|headfirst}} from here into the water below! It would be true beauty made flesh! Please consider!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> If Link jumps from the waterfall, Gruve will exclaim in excitement before asking Link to return by means of the waterfall.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Blinding brightness!}} Radiant beauty! *ahem* OK, now {{Color|BotW Red|climb the waterfall}} and then meet me back here!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> If Link returns without climbing the waterfall, Gruve will reassert his desire to see him ascend via the waterfall.<ref>{{Cite|If you don't mind, I'd love for you to show me how you {{Color|BotW Red|climb a waterfall}} from the water below. If you have the {{Color|BotW Blue|Zora armor}}, it should be fairly easy!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> After successfully fulfilling Gruve's request, Gruve will give Link five [[Fleet-Lotus Seeds]] as a reward.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Fantastic!}} Can you feel that?! My soul is on fire! It's pulsating with beauty! You showed me something truly special! Thank you so much! Now then, come over here real quick!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Big|That was amazing!}} I saw your dive and waterfall climb with my own lucky eyes! And now those very eyes are flooded with tears of joy! Yes! I must thank you somehow!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> If Link's inventory space for Fleet-Lotus Seeds is full, Gruve will tell him to return when he has space for them.<ref>{{Cite|I'd like to give you something as thanks, but it seems you do not have room for my {{Color|BotW Red|five}} {{Color|BotW Blue|fleet-lotus seeds}}. Please lighten your load, and then come back to speak with me again.|Gruve|BotW}}</ref> Bidding goodbye, Gruve will inform Link that he hopes to see his next dive.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I feel emotionally ravaged after that! It's not every day I get to see a diving form as beautiful as yours, you know! I'll be looking forward to your next dive! I really will!|Gruve|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nGruve's name is a corruption of ''groove''.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Zora\n |characters= BotW\n}}\n[[es:Gruve]]\n[[fr:Gruve]]\n[[zh-tw:\u8afe\u723e]]"
