Stone Taluses (Luminous) are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Stone Taluses (Luminous) are variations of Stone Taluses, with the notable difference that the Ore Deposit on their body is instead a Luminous Stone Deposit. Like all Taluses, the only way to damage a Stone Talus (Luminous) is to strike its Ore Deposit with a weapon. They're particularly vulnerable to Iron Sledgehammers and other mining tools as well as Bomb Arrows.
The Medal of Honor: Talus can be obtained from Kilton by defeating all Stone Taluses (Luminous) as well as all other variations of Talus in Hyrule Kingdom. This can only be done after defeating Calamity Ganon and completing the "Destroy Ganon" Main Quest.
