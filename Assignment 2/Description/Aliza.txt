I met the hero of Hyrule under this sacred tree!|Aliza|BotW}}</ref> There she diligently waits to meet the hero of legend, whom she is smitten with. Until [[Link]] speaks with her, she will stand beneath the Tree regardless of [[Weather]] or [[Time]] of day. If Link approaches her, she will preemptively speak to him.<ref>{{Cite|You're finally here...|Aliza|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link first speaks with Aliza, she initially believes him to be the legendary hero.<ref name=\"Sacred\"/> However, regardless if Link confirms or denies this, she will backtrack on her assertion and doubt his status. Aliza states that the hero of legend is characterized by carrying the [[Legendary Sword]] on his back.<ref>{{Cite|[Uh... What?] So you're not the hero of legend? I was so sure... ...But now that you mention it, you're way too scrawny to be the hero. And you don't have the {{Color|BotW Red|legendary sword}}.

At long last I\u2014 Wait a minute! You don't even have a sword. You can't be the hero of legend! Nice try, buddy. The hero of Hyrule always carries the {{Color|BotW Red|legendary sword}} with him.

Oh, I wish I could meet him...|Aliza|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter acquiring the Master Sword, Link can return to Aliza and state his status as the Hero of Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite|So did you meet the hero of Hyrule?|Aliza|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|[I am he.] WHAT?!

It feels SO good to check that off the bucket list! But...now that I've met you, some of the excitement's gone. I mean, you're not even my type...|Aliza|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Sorry, buddy. Well, toodle-oo!|Aliza|BotW}}</ref> If Link talks to Aliza later on, she scolds Link for talking to random strangers, insisting that he should be out doing his job.<ref>{{Cite|You must be really busy, you know, saving the world and all.
