You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere. You want to get out of here, get rid of that monkey!|[[Chatter Telephone]]'s warning to [[Woody]]|Toy Story 3}}\n\n'''The Monkey''' is a Musical Jolly Chimp monkey toy who is a character in the [[2010]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. He is a major antagonist that reforms in the end of the film.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Monkey is a cymbal-banging monkey toy at [[Sunnyside Daycare]]. He doesn't speak, but he does make screeching monkey noises.\n\nThe Monkey is first seen being played by [[Bonnie Anderson]] when the much older [[Mrs. Davis|Ms. Davis]] goes to Sunnyside to donate the toys and meets [[Mrs. Anderson|Bonnie's mother]], and Bonnie is extremely shy to talk to Andy's mom.\n\nDuring the times when Sunnyside is under [[Lotso-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]'s regime, the Monkey has worked under Lotso as a nighttime guard watching all the security cameras in his office. Every time a toy tries to escape, the Monkey pushes a button that turns on the P.A. and screeches loudly into it while banging his cymbals together repeatedly, alerting Lotso and his other nighttime guard toys to capture that toy like a security alarm.\n\nWhen [[Woody]] returns to Sunnyside to rescue his imprisoned friends, the [[Chatter Telephone]] tells information about the Monkey to Woody and says that he'll have to get rid of the Monkey if he wants to escape.\n\nThat night, the Monkey is busy focusing his eyes on one camera where [[Ken Carson|Ken]], [[Big Baby]], and the reset [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] have cornered [[Mr. Potato Head]] (who escaped from his cell and left a real potato in it) that he doesn't notice [[Slinky Dog|Slinky]] coming out of his cell in the Caterpillar Room through another camera. Woody and Slinky quietly go through the vent into the Monkey's office. With Slinky grabbing hold of Woody and swinging him, Woody tries to put a plastic black bag over the Monkey's face, but the Monkey has already noticed them, and he quickly turns around and screeches at Woody, making him and Slinky fall on the Monkey due to getting startled. The Monkey and Woody both get up, and the Monkey turns and hisses at the surprised Woody and scatters off to go tell Lotso. However, before he can reach the door, Woody trips him over with the P.A.'s cord. This then leads to a brief fight, in which the Monkey overpowers Woody by repeatedly banging his cymbals on Woody's face. Woody tells Slinky to grab a nearby scotch tape, and the Monkey screeches in horror when he turns to see Slinky charging toward him. Woody and Slinky then tie him up with the tape '''('''''like a mummy''''')''' and lock him in a filing cabinet.\n\nLotso's later knowledge of Woody and his friends' escaping in the first place is not revealed, but it is likely that the Monkey has managed to free himself and alert Lotso, leading to Lotso beating up the Chatter Telephone for information on Woody's whereabouts.\n\nDuring the film credits, the Monkey has returned to his position of monitoring security cameras at night again after Sunnyside is revolutionized into a cool and groovy toy paradise by [[Barbie]] and Ken, Sunnyside's new leaders. Seeing a disco party taking place at the Butterfly Room through one of the security cameras, the Monkey, also enjoying the disco, puts on his star-shaped sunglasses and starts playing his clash cymbals gently, indicating that he has reformed as well.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nTumblr lanhk6L2pY1qa44fmo1.png|The Monkey being held by [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]\nTumblr laol9d8LSK1qa44fmo1 500.png|The Monkey screeching and banging his cymbals\nCymbals.jpg|The real life toy version of Disney Pixar's Monkey by the Daishin CK Company\nThe Monkey.jpg\n15944864.jpg|SUNGLASSES\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is very likely that director [[Lee Unkrich]] put a monkey in the film due to\u00a0his love for monkeys.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtKevzkRis John Lasseter Q&A: \"Do You Like Monkeys?\"]</ref>\n*His sounds are reused from the [[Barrel of Monkeys]].\n*He's similar to the experimental monkey from the [[1988]] American horror film ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Shines_(film) Monkey Shines]''.\n*Despite being a monkey, it is actually a chimpanzee. And chimpanzees are apes.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{PixarWiki}}\n{{Toy Story}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Monkey, The}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters based on real life Toys]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
