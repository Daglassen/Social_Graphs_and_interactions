The only line he says (other than demented laughter heard in the background) is \"Run.\"\n\n==Appearance==\nHis appearance is a slender, demonic clown, white skin, olive nose, magenta lips, light yellow teeth, vermilion hair styles like devil's horns, red eyes with yellow sclerae, dressed as a firefighter with a wicked smile holding a fork and fire hose.\n\n==Personality==\nEvil, mad, sinister, menacing, threatening, mean, scary, devilish, creepy, cunning, ruthless, dangerous, impatient, wicked, diabolical, manipulative, snide, egotistical, obnoxious, impolite and cruel\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Evil Clown appears in the\u00a0[[Toaster]]'s dream. He appears after [[Rob McGroarty|the Master]] gets caught by the smoke and the entire room catches on fire. He dares Toaster to run for his life, and Toaster begins to do what the Clown dares him to do on what's left of the kitchen counter. The Clown, looking very amused at the situation, then lets out a blast of water that later becomes a huge wave of forks that he merely escapes from. He disappears after shooting the hose but is heard laughing in the bathroom with Toaster hanging over a bathtub filled with water and his cord plugged into the Circuit losing his grip. As\u00a0Toaster falls into the bathtub, he and his friends are awoken by a loud thunderclap, bringing him out of his nightmare.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The sequence with the clown is considered to be the scariest scene of the movie.\n*His scene is rather pointless, as he does not appear in the original novel. He comes out of nowhere, does not serve any particular purpose, and Toaster never mentions him after the scene ends (referred to as a \"Big Lipped Alligator Moment\" by movie tropers). This makes it arguably the most realistic depiction of a dream in any Disney production, as real-life dreams are generally considered meaningless, inconsequential, and without any semblance of logic, not even a deliberate lack thereof as with the likes of [[Wonderland]].\n*Given his attire, this clown is similar to the [[Clowns|Fireman Clowns]] from ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"151\" spacing=\"small\">\nRUN.png|\"Run.\"\nScary clown.png\nSkary Clown's Howes.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Brave Little Toaster}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The Brave Little Toaster characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Clowns]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
