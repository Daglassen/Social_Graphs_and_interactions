He is an anti-hero known for his ability to break the fourth wall. He is portrayed by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nDeadpool was created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza.\n\n==Background==\n===Powers and abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''Healing Factor:''' Deadpool possesses a superhuman healing factor that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. Deadpool is able to heal from injuries such as slashes, puncture wounds, bullet wounds, beheading, and severe burns within moments. His healing factor can also work with significant successes that most superheroes with healing abilities would have difficulty with, including regrowing missing limbs and organs. His head or any other limb can be reattached using this ability, but has to be placed in the proper place. Even after being beheaded, Deadpool can still move his body normally.\n**'''Foreign Chemical Resistance:''' Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins.\n**'''Extended Longevity/Immortality:''' Deadpool's healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process to a long lifespan at an unknown degree. He was eventually made effectively immortal by [[Thanos]], in an attempt to prevent him from spending time with Death, whom Thanos has courted most of his life.\n*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Deadpool possesses superhuman strength; as he can lift humans above his head and send them flying through the air with one arm.\n*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Deadpool has superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for several days before boredom or stress takes over, and could have possibly gone on further.\n*'''Superhuman Agility:''' Deadpool's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.\n*'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Deadpool's reflexes are similarly enhanced, superior to those of even the finest human athlete.\n*'''4th Wall Awareness:''' Possibly as a result of his mental state, he is aware that he is a fictional character, as he broke the fourth wall to the point of it being a character trait.\n\n====Abilities====\n*'''Master Hand-To-Hand Combatant/Martial Artist:''' Deadpool is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist; as he is a master in multiple unarmed combat techniques.\n*'''Master Assassin:''' He is a master of assassination techniques, espionage methods, covert operations, infiltration methods, escape artistry, marksmanship, and is highly skilled with many bladed weapons (frequently carrying two swords strapped to his back), and a number of other weapons including firearms.\n*'''Unpredictability:''' It is difficult for anyone to know what Deadpool will do at any given moment, given that he himself barely knows what he'll do at any given moment. This makes it difficult for most opponents to predict what he will do. In most versions, even [[Taskmaster]]'s ability to mimic one's fighting style was unable to read Deadpool's moves, especially since Deadpool humorously implemented dance moves into his fighting style.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''X-Men Origins: Wolverine''===\nWade Wilson is a mercenary working for Weapon X, under Col. William Stryker. He aids the raid on a Vietnamese village to obtain a meteorite made of adamantium. He is quite the chatterbox, with Wolverine asking if he ever shut up. However, after Logan left, finally done with the brutality of his job, the entire team disbands. \n\nLater, Wade was experimented on by Stryker, having Sabertooth hunt down mutants in order to splice him with their DNA and thus grant him their powers to use as his ultimate weapon. He also implanted adamantium katana blades into Wade's arms. He sealed Wade's mouth shut with skin graft to make him a \"mutant killer\". He is dubbed '''Weapon XI''', although Stryker mentions him having \"powers of ''dead'' mutants ''pooled'' together\". \n\nWeapon XI is unleashed to fight Wolverine, with Sabertooth assisting him. Using Cyclops' laser beams, Wolverine superheats his claws to decapitate Weapon XI, kicking his body of the cooling tower. However, thanks to his healing factor, Wade survived this, his body retrieving his head, his mouth no longer sealed. However, this was undone by the events of ''X-Men: Days of Future Past''.\n\n===''Deadpool''===\nIn the rebooted timeline, Wade Wilson is a former special forces operative-turned-mercenary, his mutant powers dormant. He frequented Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children, a bar for mercenaries, and befriended the owner Jack Hammer, nicknamed Weasel. One job specifically involved breaking into a rival's house, ordering a pizza, as the delivery boy was his target, as a favor for a girl he was stalking. \n\nWade later meets a prostitute named Vanessa Carlyse, instantly taking a liking to her thanks to her witty attitude, after paying for a night of skee ball at an arcade, he sleeps with her, thus they eventually become involved romantically. However, in 2016, Wade contracts terminal cancer, and is offered a chance at a cure by a shady business man working for a subsidiary of Weapon X. He reluctantly abandons Vanessa to take up the offer, and is inducted as a patient at the facility. He is told by the current leader of operations, Francis Freeman aka Ajax, that the facility puts patients through grueling experiments to unlock mutant powers via extreme stress and trauma. \n\nAjax soon puts Wade in a suffocation tank, which finally activates his healing factor, but horribly disfigures him as the cancer overtakes his body. Wade escapes and fights Ajax, but is impaled to the ground via rebar and is left in the burning facility. However, he survives, but is unwilling to return to Vanessa on account of his hideous scarred appearance. He opts to find Francis to make him reverse the process and undo his disfigurement. He gets the idea to operate as a costumed vigilante codenamed Deadpool, after seeing Weasel's bet on a dead pool, and moving in with a blind elderly woman named Bling Al. \n\nThe following year, as Deadpool, he proceeds to hunt down all of Ajax's associates and eventually locates Ajax and his envoy, intercepting them on a highway bridge. After subduing Ajax, he is interrupted by two [[X-Men (team)|X-Men]], [[Colossus (X-Men)|Colossus]] and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who are there to apprehend them both. While ranting at them, Ajax slips away. In anger, Deadpool ends up breaking all his limbs due to Colossus' metal skin, but escapes detainment by cutting off his hand.\n\nAfter returning home, his hand grows back and he musters the courage to find Vanessa and confess his situation, but finds out Ajax and Angel Dust have kidnapped Vanessa. He asks help from Colossus and Warhead, and confronts Ajax at a decommissioned [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarrier]], who has Vanessa locked in a suffocation tank. After working his way through the soldiers, Deadpool finally battles Ajax atop the carrier, and with help from Vanessa and Warhead, collapses the carrier. Finally subduing Francis, the villain reveals he lied about being able to cure Wade, which prompts him to unceremoniously shoot him dead, much to Colossus' disappointment. \n\nAfterwards, he finally reconciles Vanessa over his abandonment, and reluctantly lets her unmask him, revealing his scarred face to her. However, she gladly accepts it, and the two finally kiss, with Colossus telling Wade he will still make a great addition to the X-Men.\n\n===''Deadpool 2 ''===\nDeadpool returns in an adventure including fellow mutant mercenaries Cable and Domino.\n\n===''[[Deadpool 3]] ''===\nDeadpool will return in this film, set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\n==[[Marvel Animation]]==\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\nDeadpool's face can be briefly seen on a Timely Magazine cover page during the battle between [[Spider-Man]] (in [[Wolverine|Wolverine's]] body) and [[Sabretooth]].\n\nDeadpool later appears as a video game character used by [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] to beat Parker who uses his [[Spider-Man|alter-ego character]] in a video game at Harry's place.\n\nDeadpool himself later appears in the series as a former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent. In his debut episode, he introduces himself (and interrupts Spider-Man's recap) to the audience and his mission to find Taskmaster. He returns to S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters to recruit Spider-Man, where the members of Spider-Man's group explained their history with Deadpool, prompting Spider-Man to ask him why he was giving an alumni visit. Deadpool explains that Agent McGuffin swiped encrypted S.H.I.E.L.D. files on the secret identities of every known hero, which Deadpool must retrieve. Spider-Man reluctantly tags along with Deadpool to learn things from him. During this time, Deadpool also continually tells and changes his origin story to make himself appear cooler to Spider-Man, such as saying that \"ninjas stole his mother\" and that Nick Fury adopted him afterwards.\n\nWhile the two fly to the base, Agent McGuffin sends some of his henchmen to chase the two, with Deadpool concluding that he and Spider-Man must ditch the jet before he blasted the two out. The henchmen speed up and caught the two as they freefell to the ground, being defeated when Deadpool removed their backpacks and threw them at each other. On the ground, Deadpool told Spider-Man his plan was to \"un-alive\" Taskmaster and his men, which Spider-Man disapproved of. When Taskmaster shows up, Deadpool easily defeats him (due to Deadpool being so unpredictable he can't copy his moves) while Spider-Man grabs the hard drive with the secret identities. However, he then learns from Taskmaster and Deadpool that Deadpool was really the one who made the encrypted file in order to sell the secret identities on the market, with Taskmaster stealing it from him while he was in a restaurant bathroom. Spider-Man and Deadpool fight each other physically which evolves into a \"fantasy fight\" which Spider-Man wins with his morality. After all the fake origin stories he told before, Deadpool tells Spider-Man the truth: he was once a troubled, bullied kid recruited by Nick Fury to be a hero, but became disillusioned with Fury's goals and became a mercenary when he decided it was easier than carrying a conscience. After this, Deadpool then escapes using a jetpack, comically complaining that its rockets were burning his butt as he flew away.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Due to his fourth-wall awareness, Deadpool, aware he is on a children's show, says \"un-alive\" instead of \"kill\".\n*''Ultimate Spider-Man'' is the fourth animated appearance of Deadpool. Previous versions include ''X-Men: The Animated Series'', ''Hulk Vs Wolverine'', and ''Marvel Anime: X-Men''.\n*In the comics, it was explained that Deadpool got his healing factor from the Weapon X program, the program that was known for giving Wolverine his adamantium skeleton, in an attempt to cure him of terminal cancer; the process was only halfway successful because of the interference of the cancerous cells, which also keep regenerating, leading to his disfigurement.\n*He, [[Wolverine]], [[Juggernaut]], and [[Sabretooth]] are the only X-Men characters to appear in any of the Disney XD/Marvel animated shows.\n*Deadpool (played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) appeared in live-action in the [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] ''X-Men'' universe films ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'', ''Deadpool'' and ''Deadpool 2''. Reynolds will reprise his role in ''[[Deadpool 3]]'', set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name = \"Collider\">{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/deadpool-3-mcu-confirmed-r-rating-filming-details-kevin-feige-interview/|title=Feige Confirms \u2018Deadpool 3\u2019 Is an MCU Movie; Teases R-Rating and When It\u2019s Filming|website=Collider|date=[[January 11]], [[2021]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:thedailybugle:Deadpool|Deadpool on Ultimate Spider-Man Wiki]]\n*[[w:c:marvel:Deadpool|Deadpool on the Marvel Database]]\n\n{{USMWiki}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[sr-el:Dedpul]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:X-Men Cinematic Universe]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Upcoming characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
