Nebb is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Nebb is a curious boy who lives in Hateno Village. His desire to learn about the various weapons in the world leads him to give Link the Side Quest, "The Weapon Connoisseur." He can often be found circling the signpost in front of the Ventest Clothing Boutique, wondering about the wold outside of his village.
Once Link stops him to chat, Nebb asks him if he is from beyond Hateno. The boy points out that the hero appears to be capable of defending himself and asks Link if this is true. Regardless of his answer, Nebb decides to ask Link for help in making a dream of his come true. Nebb explains that his grandfather was a lover of weaponry who passed away before seeing all of the weapons he wanted to. Nebb asks Link to bring different weapons back to Hateno so that one day, he can reunite with his grandfather and describe them to him. Link is happy to agree to the task and Nebb's first request is for a Traveler's Sword. The end of the conversation begins the quest.
If Link returns to him without the proper item equipped, Nebb will remind him of which weapon he wants to see.
When it rains, Nebb runs home to get out of the shower. There, he plays with a small stick, using it as a makeshift sword.
