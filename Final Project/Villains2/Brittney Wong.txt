She is shown to have a dislike for [[Star Butterfly|Star]], calling her a \"pesky magical foreigner\" from \"Moo-ni\", and cares more about herself than others. In a subversion of usual \"mean girl\" characters, Brittney does not actively antagonize Star, as she in fact wants as little to do with Star as humanly possible in order to ensure that Star does not upstage her.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nBrittney has black hair that reaches down to her waist, a light skin tone, and brown eyes. She dresses in a white and purple shirt with a purple skirt and purple shoes with white socks. Her cheerleading uniform is yellow with a white stripe, the initials E.C.A. (Echo Creek Academy) inside and red trim.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode \"[[Brittney's Party]]\", Brittney is revealed to be a terrible singer.\n*Brittney has a habit of whipping her hair at things that disgust her.\n*Brittney's voice actress, Minae Noji, is best known for her role as Dr. Kelly Lee on the soap opera ''[[Wikipedia:General Hospital|General Hospital]]''.\n\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wong, Brittany}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
