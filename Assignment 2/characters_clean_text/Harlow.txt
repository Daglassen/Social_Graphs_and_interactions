Harlow is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Harlow is a worker at the Snowfield Stable. At night, Harlow will be scrubbing the stable floor saying that she has to clean while it is dark. During the day, she will sit beside Danton's Cooking Pot next to the Stable. She will quickly move into the stable if it starts snowing. She is annoyed by the pursuit of power and thinks that there is more to being a hero than having the Sword that Seals the Darkness, which Danton is fascinated by. If Link agrees with Harlow, she says that she hopes a kind swordsman like him will be the one to wield the Master Sword, if it exists. If Link instead tells her that he loves adventure, she will note that he willingly ventured to Snowfield Stable. If Link obtains and shows the Master Sword to Danton, Harlow will overhear what their conversation and will encourage Link to rest at the Stable when he needs to as she cannot do much to help him other than keeping the Stable clean.
