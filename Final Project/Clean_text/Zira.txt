fall towards Simba which has dodge before finally defeating her Zira appears the seventh book the insider the same her film counterpart she near religiously loyal Scar She and other minions were after the Keepers who used they DHI states launch earthquake debris her was originally planned for Zira deliberately let the cliff rather than simply reject Kiara help but her fall was instead depicted her simply slipping while rejecting Kiara aid was felt that the villain committing suicide was too adult for Disney movie However although this concept was cut Zira death the finished version the film still implied suicide just accident you look closely you can see that she smiling though this could just her muzzle Moreover she gradually losing her grip the final version visible how her position changes because first seen how her fangs are about reach the lower edge the cliff and then just before she falls she much higher position When Zira and Simba encounter each other onscreen for the first time Zira line you need your pound flesh she pushes Kovu forward actually reference the Shakespearian play The Merchant Venice even though Simba Pride based Romeo and Juliet During early production the producers had originally named Zira Bianca but this was not Swahillian enough and could easily confused with Miss Bianca which her name was changed Zira When Zira blames Kovu for the death Nuka her reasoning seems somewhat ironic for someone who had high opinion Scar She told Kovu that betrayed his pride which exactly what Scar did when allowed Hyena Clan the hyenas invade She also told him that killed his own brother which again exactly what Scar did Also Kovu hardly can held accountable for this seeing Nuka fell and had nothing with him This scene vaguely similar when Scar accused Simba murdering his father But while Scar was simply trying discourage Simba Zira truly believed what she said was true early production Zira then named Bianca was originally going Scar mate and the mother his cub Nunka who would become Kovu who would seduce Aisha Kiara original name Because this would incest due Nunka and Aisha being first cousins once removed the relationship was obscured make Zira follower Scar and Nunka became Kovu and was instead Scar adopted son Some media suggests that Zira best was romantically attracted Scar When Kovu training being reviewed the notch Zira ear switches sideways the other ear some Lion King Simba Pride reading books her eyes are mistakenly colored dark blue dark green Kovu eventually will become the Pride Land King meaning Zira actually succeeded with her plan fulfill Scar dying wish but not avenge his death killing Simba also fulfills Mufasa wish and hopes that both the Pridelanders and Outsiders got rejoined through Kovu and Kiara while presumably taking into account Scar dying wish despite his murder him Zira role follower Scar contradicts the events the first film where all the lionesses present the time were followers Mufasa and Simba and had fought beside Simba against Scar was revealed The Lion Guard that she and Scar were very close and that shared his knowledge the Roar the Elders with her which perfectly supports the contradiction However possible that she and the Outsider lionesses were still away hunting and just returned after Simba reclaimed the throne Zira Percival McLeach McLeach Luk and Forte are the only Disney sequel villains actually die Jafar does not count because originally appeared the first film its main antagonist Bette Midler and Helen Mirren were considered for the role Zira before the late Suzanne Pleshette was cast Her name means hatred Swahili She has mark her head The Lion Guard except Rafiki painting The Lion King characters"
