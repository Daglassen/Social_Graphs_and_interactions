Evenrude would be given the job of hunting down the infamous pirate-captain [[Jack Sparrow]] only for Evenrude to show his greedy and corrupt side. Evenrude sent letters to Sparrow promising to delay the navy's attack on him in-return for a jewel known as the Treasure of the Indian Ocean.\n\nSparrow and his crew would betray Evenrude however, channeling the mystic powers of the jewel while leaving its curse to be inflicted upon John. This transformed John into an undead skeleton and left him at the bottom of a tropical river with him declaring that he would seek vengeance on Jack.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[A Pirate's Adventure: Treasures of the Seven Seas]]===\nEvenrude was the main antagonist of the ''Guardian\u2019s Curse'' mission of this interactive game in [[Adventureland]]. Letters between him and Jack can be found throughout the adventure and he is portrayed as a skeleton in a river at the end of the mission.\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Commanders]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
