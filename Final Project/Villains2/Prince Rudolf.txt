He seeks to overthrow the kingdom while pretending that the lost prince has returned.\n\nHe claims to be second in line to the throne and challenges the princess' rights. He hides the map to the location of [[the Ruby Wings]] in a safe in the reading room, as whomever wore them would rule the kingdom.\n\nWhen [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and [[Airplane Jane]] find out his secret, Rudolf tries to stop them by pursuing them in a heavily armed blimp, but Rudolf is defeated when Baloo tears a hole in the blimp's balloons with an anchor, upon which it crashes into the water.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-25.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-26.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-51.png\nTalespin - 145 - waiders of the wost tweasure Video - Rediff Videos3.jpg|Rudolf's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rudolf, Prince}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Swans]]\n[[Category:Princes]]"
