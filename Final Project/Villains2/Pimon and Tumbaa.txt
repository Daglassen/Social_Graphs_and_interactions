They like to pick on animals of the jungle, especially [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]]. They're also known to give wedgies to those they choose to bully.\n\n===Physical Description===\nPimon is a pale brown meerkat with a creamy yellow chest and brown stripes. He also has black hair.\n\nTumbaa is a dark brown warthog with a darker brown belly and light brown lips.\n\nBoth Pimon and Tumbaa are muscular and they are shown to have tattoos under their fur.\n\n==Role in the series==\nAfter Timon and Pumbaa catch some bugs and put them in a bag, they run into Pimon and Tumbaa. Tumbaa and Pimon steal Timon and Pumbaa's bag of bugs. They also have their own philosophy: \"Kahuna Potato,\" which means that they're never going to leave Timon and Pumbaa alone. They then proceed to give Timon and Pumbaa wedgies.\n\nLater, while Tumbaa and Pimon pick on a squirrel, Timon and Pumbaa show up ready to fight them. At one point, the bullies trick Timon and Pumbaa into thinking they're hurt, but Timon and Pumbaa retaliate using their own fighting tactics. Pimon and Tumbaa end up losing the fight, and feed Timon and Pumbaa the bugs in the bag.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Enemies called \"[[w:c:borderlands:Pimon|Pimon]]\" and \"[[w:c:borderlands:Tumbaa|Tumbaa]]\" also appear in the video game ''Borderlands 2'', but their names are probably a direct reference to Timon and Pumbaa themselves rather than these very obscure characters, with the same simple name-corruption pun being made by coincidence.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nPimon.jpg|Pimon\nTumbaa.jpg|Tumbaa\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h08m55s852.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h09m10s508.png\natomicwedgies.jpg|\"Atomic wedgies!\"\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h20m35s210.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h20m48s080.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h21m07s474.png\nTattoo Pimon and Tumbaa.jpg|Pimon and Tumbaa's tattoos\nPimon and Tumbaa-1.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h21m22s590.png|Unleash the \"Fart of Fury\"!\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h21m46s724.png|Tumbaa and Pimon defeated\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h21m53s712.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-15h22m15s674.png|The bullies feeding their foes the stolen bugs\n</gallery>\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Warthogs]]\n[[Category:Meerkats]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:African characters]]"
