When first approached, Symin offers [[Link]] a greeting and fawns over the shelves of research tomes in the Lab's possession.<ref>{{Cite|Good morning. I imagine you've never seen so many books in one place. Pretty incredible, isn't it? We've gathered all of Hyrule's known literature on ancient civilizations here.|Symin|BotW}}</ref> The assistant begins to wonder at the exact amount of books on hand, but is distracted by the sight of Link's [[Sheikah Slate]].<ref>{{Cite|As for the actual number of books, well... ...Hmm? Is that... That thing on your waist? Is that a Sheikah... There's no mistaking it. That's a real {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Slate}}, isn't it?! I've never actually seen one in person!|Symin|BotW}}</ref> He requests to see the [[Rune]]s on the Slate, which Link readily does.<ref>{{Cite|If you could just show me the {{Color|BotW Red|runes}} on it, I'd be most appreciative. {{Color|BotW Blue|Stasis}}... {{Small|Ah.}} {{Color|BotW Blue|Magnesis}}... {{Small|Yes, yes.}} The {{Color|BotW Blue|Remote Bomb}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|Cryonis}}... {{Small|And what else? Let's see...}}|Symin|BotW}}</ref> Although he examines all of the runes, he notes that Link appears to be missing some.<ref>{{Cite|So that's it for runes... But... Hmm... Strange... It doesn't seem like you have the {{Color|BotW Red|basic runes}}... I don't understand why they're missing. There must be a reason...|Symin|BotW}}</ref> After a moment, he realizes that he has not given Link his name and properly introduces himself.<ref>{{Cite|Ah! Where are my manners? I nearly forgot to introduce myself! My name in Symin.|Symin|BotW}}</ref> Before Link is able to return the favor, Symin correctly guesses his name.<ref>{{Cite|You are... Link, right?|Symin|BotW}}</ref> He explains that [[Impa]] informed him about Link ahead of time.<ref>{{Cite|[You know my name?] Lady Impa caught me up to speed. You see...we were told, \"A young man holding a {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Slate}} will appear. And you must do all you can to help him. He will be the hope that awakens from the {{Color|BotW Blue|Slumber of Restoration}}. His name will be Link.\"|Symin|BotW}}</ref> Symin remembers that he must tell Link something important and turns to get [[Purah]]'s attention.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, dear! I forgot to tell you something very important. {{Color|BotW Red|Director}}! Listen, {{Color|BotW Red|Ms. Director}}! This is a REAL {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Slate}}!|Symin|BotW}}</ref> Link will ask Symin to clarify and the man realizes that he has not yet introduced Purah to him, motioning to the little girl in the room.<ref>{{Cite|[Director?] Oh, that's right... I haven't introduced our {{Color|BotW Red|director}}. Ms. Purah happens to be right over there... As the {{Color|BotW Blue|Hateno Ancient Tech Lab}} {{Color|BotW Red|director}}, Ms. Purah is the world's foremost authority on ancient Hyrule culture.|Symin|BotW}}</ref> He respects Purah greatly.<ref>{{Cite|I have the utmost respect for Ms. Purah and all she's accomplished. I'm honored to be her assistant.|Symin|BotW}}</ref> He begins to explain the director's appearance, but realizes that maybe Purah should be the one to do so.<ref>{{Cite|On that note, Link... You see, the {{Color|BotW Red|director}} may look like a young girl, but... Well...maybe it's not my place to tell you these things. You should talk to Ms. Purah herself.|Symin|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can then ask Symin about either the Sheikah Slate or the Lab itself.<ref>{{Cite|Ah... What do you need?|Symin|BotW}}</ref> Bringing up the Slate allows Symin to explain its history.<ref>{{Cite|[Sheikah Slate?] The {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Slate}} is a device that our {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah}} ancestors developed to bring peace and order to Hyrule. The {{Color|BotW Blue|runes}} contained on your {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Slate}} are also something we {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah}} developed.|Symin|BotW}}</ref> He expresses his pleasure with the knowledge that Link will use it properly, knowing the results would be disastrous in the wrong hands.<ref>{{Cite|I'm so relieved that you'll be using this device for the betterment of Hyrule, Link. If such a device fell into the hands of evil... I shudder to think what might happen.|Symin|BotW}}</ref> Asking about the Lab pushes Symin to excitedly explain the purpose of the building.<ref>{{Cite|The Hateno Ancient Tech Lab is where we Sheikah researchers study the scientific contributions of our ancestors. We aim to apply our findings to the world of today and to unravel the mystery of the shrines and Divine Beasts. I'm personally interested in exploring these entities from a geopolitical and structural-engineering point of view. The potential of using modern methods to reconstruct and iterate upon the past is simply too...|Symin|BotW}}</ref> Eventually, Symin realizes that he is likely boring Link with his speech.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! Putting you to sleep, am I?|Symin|BotW}}</ref> He decides to put his words in a way that expresses the usefulness of their research plainly by giving the possibility of [[Calamity Ganon]]'s full sealing.<ref>{{Cite|Well, speaking in terms that may be of interest to you... To develop technology to effectively seal {{Color|BotW Blue|Ganon}}, the infinite evil that has plagued Hyrule throughout time. We believe this can be achieved by studying and improving upon the creations of those who came before us.|Symin|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nSymin's name comes from the fruit persimmon.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hateno Villagers, Hyruleans, Sheikah\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
