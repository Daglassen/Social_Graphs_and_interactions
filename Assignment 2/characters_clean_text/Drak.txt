Drak is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Drak is a Goron miner who can be found at the Abandoned North Mine in the Eldin Canyon. He carries a Cobble Crusher, and he noticeably speaks with a slur where his vowels extend. Drak helps Link with explaining the area to him. He tells him that the Abandoned North Mine used to be active, until it grew too hot and dangerous due to the Divine Beast Vah Rudania and the infestation of monsters. Because of that, Bludo had appointed him to keep watch of the area.
When Link first speaks to Drak, he wonders why so many people are out and about. He warns Link that the Scorching Climate gets hotter past him and there are more monsters.
At the beginning of the "Divine Beast Vah Rudania" Main Quest, he can ask about Yunobo. Drak is at first suspicious and asks why a stranger is asking about Yunobo. When Link explains that Bludo asked, Drak tells Link that Yunobo went into the Mine's Vault to retrieve painkillers, but never returned. Due to its danger, Drak suggests Link doesn't go after him.
When Link approaches the Cannon closest to them, Drak warns him that he should not touch it. He discourages Link from putting any explosives inside.
During "Divine Beast Vah Rudaniah", Drak will tell Link where Yunobo is. Once Link has rescued him from the Abandoned North Mine, Drak tells Link that Yunobo went back to Goron City. He also informs Link that he saw Yunobo go to the Bridge of Eldin.
