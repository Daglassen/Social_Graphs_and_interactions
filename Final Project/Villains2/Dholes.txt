They are notorious pack of dholes who, according to [[Bagheera]], are marauders that almost destroyed the jungle, where the cubs lived, the last time they came.\n\n==Role in\u00a0[[Jungle Cubs|the series]]==\nIn the series, an episode featured the cubs driving the dholes out of the jungle by themselves; with the dogs attempting to attack [[Shere Khan|Khan]] in the temple where the cubs hung out. Bagheera, [[Kaa]], [[Colonel Hathi|Hathi]] and [[King Louie|Louie]] lured the dholes into a chase, each one hiding after a certain distance to allow another to take over, culminating in [[Baloo]] tricking them into falling into a gorge filled with bees.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like the cubs (excluding Louie), the wolves and [[Mowgli]], the Dholes are characters adapted from the original novel.\n**The Dholes are also the ones who kill Akela in ''The Second Jungle Book''.\n*The Dholes resemble the original design of\u00a0[[Tabaqui]] and also [[Don Karnage]]. Ironically, both them and their pack leader are both voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]"
