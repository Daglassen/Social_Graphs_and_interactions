Kairo is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Kairo is a traveling Goron merchant who can be found walking along the road near the Maw of Death Mountain in Eldin Canyon. He used to work at the Goron Hot Springs, but grew bored there and decided to travel the world as a merchant. He sells a limited selection of Gems at a fairly low price, which he dug up at Death Mountain. During rain, Kairo will sell rare Gems as well. As with all other merchants, he will buy items from Link as well.
Kairo mentions that he and Yunobo are friends, and wonders how he is doing while he is away.
If Link saves Kairo from monsters encountered along the route, he will sometimes give the hero a Fireproof Elixir in gratitude.
