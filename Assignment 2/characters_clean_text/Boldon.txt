== Biography ==
Boldon is a Goron traveler who can be found walking along Ternio Trail. He walks to the Foothill Stable before heading back along the trail. 
Boldon is the ambassador of tourism of Goron City, and recommends that everyone visit it, but also admits that it has its share of problems. Boldon adds that because of the Divine Beast Vah Rudania, the Goron Hot Springs have seen fewer tourists lately. Boldon also tells Link that if he plans on visiting Goron City or other Scorching Climates, he should wear the Flamebreaker Armor or make a Fireproof Elixir.
In the Lanayru Region, Boldon says that there is a noticeable difference to the east and west of the dividing line, which is why Woodland Stable is too cold for Gorons. Boldon comments about the ruined Hyrule Castle. He says the treasure hunters who plunder it are crazy.
If an enemy is fought near him, Boldon assumes a defensive position and tells the threat to come and get him. When spoken to after this, the Goron says that if they put their together their heads as well as their muscles, the two can "stomp em' flat." He will then reward Link with a dish.
