== Biography ==
Mozo Shenno is a Sheikah Monk who serves the Goddess Hylia. Following the first Great Calamity and the ostracism of the Sheikah 10,000 years prior to Breath of the Wild, Mozo Shenno became a Monk and constructed an Ancient Shrine to help prepare Link against the threat of Calamity Ganon.
Following Link's Slumber of Restoration in the Shrine of Resurrection, the Mozo Shenno Shrine is activated and can then be entered by someone bearing a Sheikah Slate. When Link enters the Shrine, he is greeted by the Monk and is offered the Shrine's Trial in the name of Hylia. If Link completes the Trial, Mozo Shenno praises him and rewards the Hylian Champion with a Spirit Orb. With their role fulfilled, Mozo Shenno wishes Link well as their body fades away.
