He is a Captain in the Imperial Starfighter Corp, the Headmaster of Skystrike Academy, a Commander in the Imperial Navy, and the Head of [[Thrawn|Grand Admiral Thrawn]]'s TIE Defender initiative.\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nVult Skerris is a very skilled [[TIE Pilots|TIE Pilot]] who is extremely loyal to the [[Emperor Palpatine|Emperor]] and who despises the Rebellion. He is also shown to be ruthless to the point where he is willing to open fire on unarmed ships.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nVult Skerris makes his debut appearance in \"[[The Antilles Extraction]]\" as a Captain in the Imperial Starfighter Corp and the Headmaster of Skystrike Academy. He ruthlessly trained his students to be skilled pilots who follow any orders without question. Suddenly, Skystrike receives a visit from Governor Arihnda Pryce and [[Agent Kallus]], who inform him that some of his students are traitors to the Empire. Pryce helps him nab the defecting cadets but Sabine Wren helps them escape.\u00a0\n\nVult Skerris makes his second appearance in \"[[Secret Cargo]]\". It is revealed that he has been assigned to the Imperial Navy and promoted to Commander. He is dispatched by Thrawn in his prototype [[TIE Defender]] to help Governor Pryce and Admiral Kassius Konstantine hunt down rogue Senator Mon Mothma, who has been excommunicated from the Imperial Senate as a traitor. Thanks to the Defender, Vult is able to overwhelm the rogue Senator's escort but Ezra Bridger helps them fight him off long enough for Mon Mothma to escape.\n\nHe made his third appearance in \"[[Flight of the Defender]]\" where it was revealed that Thrawn had put him in charge of the TIE Defender initiative, which was at the time in mass production.\n\nHe made his final appearance in \"[[Rebel Assault]]\" where he ignored Thrawn's orders to withdraw as Skerris wants to destroy Hera. She managed to shot him down.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Antilles Extraction 4.jpg\nFlight of the Defender 4.png\nThrawn Pryce Skerris.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]"
