part Mickey Not Scary Halloween Party Sarah kicks off the festivities sending out the call fellow Disney Villains villains singing Come Little Children After completing their potion she and Mary back Winifred she sings Put Spell You and dances with various villains Trivia The origin Come Little Children ongoing debate Some report that came from Edgar Allen Poe poem titled Come Little Children However Poe scholars dispute this claim because such poem appears Poe official omnibus and the lyrics not match his style One major element deleted from the film had the witches giving the children and Emily Binx early drugged candy crows order for Sarah song take effect This was most likely removed due the fact that candy crows were not invented until the 1880s and would have been seen illogical Sarah could not enchant the children with Come Little Children her own She has the same first name her portrayer Sarah Jessica Parker real life Sarah Jessica Parker descendant Esther Elwell woman who was put trial for being witch Salem the late 1600s The witch craze ended only month before her trial"
