Kilton is first heard of through rumors told by travelers about a shop specializing in monsters set on the \"left eye\" of [[Skull Lake]] in [[Deep Akkala]]. [[Hoz]], the guard of the [[East Akkala Stable]], will also be searching for him. Speaking to Hoz will begin the [[Side Quest]], \"[[A Shady Customer]]\", which tasks [[Link]] with taking a picture of Kilton for him.\n\nWhen first spoken to, Kilton is seen searching for something in the back of his shop. He then notices Link's scent, suspecting it is a monster and turns around to be startled before recognizing him.<ref>{{Cite|This smells like {{Color|BotW Blue|Bokoblin}} or maybe... I see... That's a shame.|Kilton|BotW}}</ref> Kilton will then offer to exchange monster parts for [[Mon]], a currency invented by him,<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Red|Mon}} is a {{Color|BotW Red|currency}} I invented to destabilize the market and fight the establishment!|Kilton|BotW}}</ref> which can be used to purchase various wares from his shop. Kilton can be found every night from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM near every village. If Link is still around after 5:00 AM, he will stay until spoken to, at which time he will bid his farewell and suddenly disappear. During the day, the spots where Kilton appears are marked by a signpost.\n\nApart from his merchant activity, Kilton is particularly interested in the scent of rare monsters. After defeating [[Calamity Ganon]], if Link has slayed every [[Overworld]] [[Boss]] of a single type at least once, Kilton will notice the scent and award Link with a [[Medal of Honor]] associated with that boss.<ref>{{Cite|You\u2014!
