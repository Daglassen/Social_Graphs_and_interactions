Ena is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ena is a Hylian child who lives at Tabantha Bridge Stable. Throughout the day, Ena follows Banji around and assists her with chores. In the morning, they tend to the Stable's White Goats, where she encourages one of the Goats, Mr. Goat, to eat. While Ena helps Banji with the cargo, She wants to know if Link keeps his cargo in his pouch. She then informs Link of a rumor that the forest people can expand one's Inventory and asks if he's heard of this.
If Link has heard of it, Ena declares the two of them to be friends and shares that people can collect the things forest children leave behind. On the contrary, if Link hasn't heard the rumor, Ena claims to have heard it from a Fairy that told her to be nice to a big forest child to receive a bigger Inventory. Despite not knowing what an Inventory is, Ena believes that bigger is always better. She wonders if the big forest kid ever leaves the forest.
Ena sings songs as she takes care of the Stable's Horses, one about Horses and one about poop. She learned the song about Horses from a man who came through the Stable with a Horse she thought was cool. He also told her about a secret tunnel in the western part of Hyrule Castle that leads inside the Castle. However, the man warned her against going due to the danger of Hyrule Castle, which she relays to Link as well. Despite the speed of his Horse, she tells him to avoid the Castle.
During the rain, Ena flees inside the Stable, where she sits at the end of one of the beds with Kenyo. She considers bringing Mr. Goat inside. At the end of the day, Ena admits she's tired before she heads to bed. {Term|BotW|Banji}} watches Ena sleep in one of the Stable's beds.
