He is a devious frog man that specializes in the dark arts of magic curses.\n\n==Background==\nBarry appears in the episode segment \"[[Cursed!]]\" as the main antagonist. He is first seen carrying a bucket of blue moon berries, which grows every ten years, until [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] and [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] bumped into him. This caused Barry to drop the bucket, spilling the contents of berries in the process. \n\nLater, he was discovered by Anne, Sprig, and [[Maddie Flour|Maddie]] in his secret hideout and revealed to the trio that he was the one responsible for placing the curse on Anne and Sprig. He did this out of spite when Anne and Sprig ruined his harvest of blue moon berries. Barry then engaged Maddie in a magic duel (tossing bags of hexes at each other). In the end, Maddie defeated Barry and transformed him into a monster bird creature.\n\n===Personality===\nAt first, Barry seems like nice friendly guy who you'd stumble upon. However he is later revealed to have unforgiving nature with farade of niceness that he blatantly admits.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBarry at his stand.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]"
