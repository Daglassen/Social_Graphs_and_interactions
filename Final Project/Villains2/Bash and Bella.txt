They are a couple of petty criminals who lust for crime and each other.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBash and Bella are an equally cocky couple who get a high off from stealing from banks and jewelry stores. The experience apparently turns them on as they have a habit of making out after every heist. They have little patience and are constantly on the move; trying to get away and head to their next bank job. There is no denying that they care a great deal for one another as they were horrified at the thought of being separated and sometime later became engaged using a wedding ring that they stole.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nBash and Bella are two equally tall people that dress in tight black pants and shirts with a brown belt and grey gloves. Individually, Bash has violet skin and longish blue hair with a slight stubble under his chin while Bella has green-turquoise skin with longish red hair curled at the end, green earrings, red lipstick and a mole under her eye. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nGramma Drive still 1.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Bella and Bash are based on Jessie and James from the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' franchise.
