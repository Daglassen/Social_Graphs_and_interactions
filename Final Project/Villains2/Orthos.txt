No, I'm more of a people person.|Orthos|Hercules and the First Day of School}}'''Orthos''' is a minor character in the Disney animated series, ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. He is a two-headed cyclops and the laziest of [[Echidna's Children|Echidna's children]]. Unlike his siblings who went off into the world to become feared legends and guardians who only ate the most richest and noblest humans, Orthos chose to stay in his mother's forest eating delivery boys. \n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''===\nIn \"[[Hercules and the First Day of School]]\", Orthos first appears when he is visited by his mother [[Echidna]], who puts them on a strict hero diet as opposed to their days of eating delivery boys. When Hercules arrives on the scene to fight Orthos, they have an easy time defeating him and see him as a nobody. But when discovering Hercules' Student ID and that Prometheus Academy has a lot of choice meals, they target the school. Hercules manages to defeat Orthos, though [[Adonis]] and his soldiers end up taking the credit.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Epic Adventure]]\", frustrated with the humiliation they received after being defeated by Hercules from the monster community, Orthos plans a revenge scheme and figures he can track Hercules down to the Pita Pit.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original Greek myth, Orthos was a two-headed dog rather than a two-headed cyclops.\n*As an infant, Orthos had an apparently rough relationship with his brother the Minotaur after the latter threw a block at his eye.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nOrthos.jpg\nOrthos1.jpg\nOrthosBaby.JPG|Orthos as a baby\nsonofechidna.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Multi-headed characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]"
