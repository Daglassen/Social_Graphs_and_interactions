He begs his inmate, [[Felix Nash]], to assist him. Nash tells Rubin that he is responsible for the murder. During his trial in the courtroom, he spots [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]], who turns out to be Nash's innocent doppelg\u00e4nger, and later reports it to Nash. While Nash pretends to be Ernest, he reminds Rubin that Ernest is not him. Rubin temporarily pretends Ernest is Nash. When Ernest magnetically resurrects from the electric chair, Rubin along with [[Lyle]] prepares to prevent Ernest's escape out of jail at the main gate after Ernest electrifies all of the security guards. At that moment, Lyle spares Ernest instead. Rubin suspiciously feels awkward about releasing Nash's doppelg\u00e4nger out of prison, but Lyle knocks him out.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nIMG 7049.jpg\nIMG 7054.jpg\nIMG 7052.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bartlett, Rubin}}\n[[Category:Ernest characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]"
