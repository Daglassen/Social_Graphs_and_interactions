He is one of [[Janja]]'s seconds-in-commands and best friends, along with [[Cheezi]], and also serves as one of the secondary antagonists.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nWhile Chungu's personality is a bit similar to [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Banzai]], he is much less intelligent and even somewhat dimmer than [[Cheezi]].\n\n===Physical appearance===\nChungu is more muscular than the rest of the [[Janja's Clan|clan]], including [[Janja]] himself, making him the largest and strongest hyena of the pack. He has gray and black fur with black spots, a black muzzle and nose, and black paws.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Intellect:''' Although Chungu is not as intelligent as [[Janja]] and even less so than [[Cheezi]], he quickly knew that [[Kion]] was too afraid to come to save [[Bunga]] from harm. But with his great loyalty, he knew that he wouldn't be fooled by Tamma, as he pointed out that he only listens to Janja's orders and knew that Tam figured that Tamma was lying.\n*'''Skilled Combatant:''' Chungu's size and strength allows him to hold his own against Kion for a short period of time.\n*'''Animal Strength:''' He was able to hold his ground for short period of time against Kion's roar.\n\n==Role in the Series==\n===''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]''===\nChungu and Cheezi are sent by their boss Janja to capture [[Bunga]] (who had entered the [[Outlands]] to get his baobab fruit back) so he can have him for lunch. Luckily, [[Kion]] is able to save his friend by using the [[Roar of the Elders]], which shocks the two hyenas, giving Bunga time to escape.\n\nLater, Chungu and the other hyenas learn from [[Mzingo]] that Kion is assembling a [[Lion Guard]] to protect The [[Pride Lands]] to which Janja declares that the clan will attack The Pride Lands that night.\n\nChungu accompanies Janja and the rest of the clan when they attack a gazelle herd and cause a stampede, which Kion's older sister [[Kiara]] gets trapped in. Luckily, Kion and the Lion Guard come to Kiara's rescue and get the herd away from her. Kion then uses The [[Roar of the Elders]] to drive Chungu and the other hyenas back to the [[Outlands]].\n\n===\"[[Never Judge a Hyena by its Spots]]\"===\nChungu, Janja, and Cheezi attack an oryx herd but are stopped by the Lion Guard. Kion orders the others to calm the herd while he goes after the hyenas, but a log snaps under Kion's feet and he falls into a river which sweeps him to the Outlands.\n\nChungu and his clan later appear when they try to attack a female hyena named [[Jasiri]], who had just helped Kion find Flat Ridge Rock in order to escape the Outlands. Luckily, Kion returns and saves Jasiri by scaring Chungu and his clan off with the [[Roar of the Elders]].\n\n===\"[[Can't Wait to be Queen]]\"===\nChungu, along with Cheezi, is seen with Janja when Mzingo arrives and says that Kiara is temporary queen and is squabbling with Kion, which gives Janja an idea.\n\nChungu, Cheezi and the rest of the clan ambush Kiara when she comes to Broken Rock to have a supposed peace treaty with Janja. Just as Janja pins Kiara down, Kion comes to his sister's aid and is soon joined by the rest of the Lion Guard, causing Chungu and the rest of the clan to flee with Janja.\n\n===\"[[Eye of the Beholder]]\"===\nChungu, Janja, and Cheezi are first seen attacking a [[Wildebeests|wildebeest]] herd but are forced to flee back to the Outlands by the Lion Guard.\n\nAfter learning that [[Ono]] has an eye injury (due to getting dirt in it) and is out of commission, Chungu along with Cheezi aid Janja in trapping the remaining members of the Lion Guard in a canyon before preparing to pick off a zebra herd.\n\nLuckily, Ono (despite his injury) arrives and moves the zebras away from the canyon, giving Kion time to blast the rocks trapping them with the Roar of the Elders. After getting caught up in the blast, Chungu returns to the Outlands with Janja and Cheezi.\n\n===\"[[The Kupatana Celebration]]\"===\nChungu and his clan pursue a jackal pup named [[Dogo]], but Kion and the Lion Guard come to the pup's rescue. When hearing that The Pride Lands is celebrating Kupatana, Janja allows the Lion Guard to take Dogo and leaves with Chungu and the rest of the clan.\n\n==='\"[[Fuli's New Family]]\"===\nChungu is grooming Janja just before Cheezi arrives and informs them of Bunga being in the Outlands. Chungu and the clan ambush the honey badger, but before they can harm him, [[Fuli]] comes to her friend's aid.\n\nThe two friends then use a piece of broken rock to float downstream in lava whilst being pursued by Chungu and the clan. Luckily, Kion, [[Beshte]] and Ono arrive and save their friends, leaving Chungu, Janja and Cheezi trapped on a log with no food.\n\n===\"[[Janja's New Crew]]\"===\nChungu and Cheezi are banned from the Outlands by Janja because he believed it was always their fault when his plans failed every time. However, after the betrayal of their replacements [[Nne]] and [[Tano]] against Janja, and after the Lion Guard defeat the two rebel hyenas, Janja accepts Cheezi and Chungu to go back with him in the Outlands.\n\n===\"[[Never Roar Again]]\"===\nWhen Janja and his clan invade the Pride Lands, the Lion Guard drives them back into the Outlands. However, once the Lion Guard departs, Janja leads his clan back into the kingdom, and the Lion Guard rushes back to stop them. Before the team can reach the hyenas, the clan runs into Kion's mother, [[Nala]], who orders Janja to return to his territory.\n\nInstead of heeding Nala's warning, Janja surrounds her with his cronies and orders an attack. Just then, Kion arrives and, seeing his mother in danger, uses the [[Roar of the Elders]] in a rage. The blast is so powerful that it knocks the hyenas back into the Outlands.\n\n===\"[[Ono's Idol]]\"===\nWhile out flying with his idol [[Hadithi]], Ono spots a group of klipspringers being trapped on the edge of a cliff by Janja and his minions, Cheezi and Chungu. He suggests that they use the Hadithi Spin to thwart the hyenas, but Hadithi argues that Ono is not ready for such a feat. He then takes off for the ceremony, leaving Ono behind to deal with the crisis.\n\nOn his own, Ono attempts to stop the hyenas using the Hadithi Spin, but falls and gets his wing trapped beneath a boulder. Cheezi and Chungu hungrily climb up the cliffs to reach him, while Janja rounds up the trapped klipspringers.\n\nHowever, before the hyenas can hurt Ono, Hadithi returns with the Lion Guard, and Fuli fends off Cheezi and Chungu. Meanwhile, Bunga and Kion confront Janja, while Beshte pushes a boulder down for the klipspringers to use as an escape. As Fuli guides the klipspringers to safety, one slips and falls, prompting Janja and his minions to spring an attack. Just in time, Ono and Hadithi fly past and begin to circle the hyenas, making them dizzy, Chungu complains that he is getting dizzy. Eventually, they topple off the cliffs and land in the water below.\n\n===\"[[The Traveling Baboon Show]]\"===\nJanja's clan chases some baboons in the Outlands.\n\n===\"[[The Rise of Scar]]\"===\nJanja's clan is attacking Ma Tembo's herd however they get defeated by the Lion Guard twice.

Scar tells him about his latest plan.  He orders Janja to enter the Pride Lands, enter the riverbank above Hakuna Matata Falls  at night, and push the rocks into the river until it stops the water from flowing. When Janja questions what that will do, Ushari tells him that this will cut off a major water supply during the middle of the dry season. The hyenas go to do Scar's plan but get defeated by the Lion Guard and [[Kinyonga]].\n\n===\"[[The Zebra Mastermind]]\"===\nAfter hearing that [[Thurston]] is the reason why the Lion Guard is so successful the two hyenas decide to bring him to the Outlands. Thurston explains about the Lion Guard's weaknesses one of them being rubbing flowers against their noses to make them sneeze. The hyenas try to do that but Beshte knocks them out of the way. Later they meet up with [[Goigoi]], [[Tamka]] and [[Nduli]] and they fight over which part of the zebra that they wanna eat. The Lion Guard soon finds out who's behind all of the crazy attacks and saves Thurston.\n\n===\"[[The Hyena Resistance]]\"===\nScar comes up with a new plan to take over Mizimu Grove.
