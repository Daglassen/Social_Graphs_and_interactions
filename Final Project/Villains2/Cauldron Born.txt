One of the more infamous cuts and one that an image of would find its way online would be a scene of the green mist from the cauldron melting the skin off the bones of one of his mortal soldiers. In the film, the Cauldron Born were animated by Phil Nibbelink and Ben Burgess.\n===Personality===\nLittle is known about the personality of the Cauldron Born, other than the fact they are embodiments of violence and evil. Their goal is to destroy all living beings in their path.\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Cauldron Born are skeletons wearing many varieties of armor and weapons.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Black Cauldron]]''===\nThe primary reason why the Horned King is searching for the [[The Black Cauldron (object)|cauldron]], he is often seen speaking to the dead bodies littering his castle. When the Cauldron finally gets into the Horned King's grasp, he calls upon its terrible power to awaken the corpses as the army of the Cauldron Born, who proceed to scare away all of his mortal minions on their way out of the castle and across the bridge into [[Prydain]], killing a few in the process. However, they are destroyed when [[Gurgi]] sacrifices himself to end the Cauldron's power. In disbelief of his deathless warriors returning to piles of bones, the Horned King attacks [[Taran]] before being sucked into the cauldron and destroyed.\n\nThe skeletons are then obliterated after the castle explodes.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nIn the episode ''[[House of Magic]]'', the creatures were accidentally unleashed by [[Daisy Duck]] when she attempted to perform [[magic]], despite being inexperienced.\n\n==Disney Parks==\nThe Cauldron Born appeared at the end of the [[Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]], where the Horned King brought them to life to attack the guests. However, they were defeated alongside their master when a guest was chosen to use a magic sword to destroy the Cauldron and beat the Horned King with it.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Animation===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7228.jpg|The mist from the cauldron passes over the dead.\nCauldron Born Image 1.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7290.jpg\nBlackcauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-6433-1-.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7306.jpg|The undead start to rise up...\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7309.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7310.jpg\nArmy of Undeads.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7326.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7345.jpg|\"Go forth, my deathless warriors!\"\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7356.jpg|\"Destroy everything in your path!\"\nDaisy Black Cauldron..jpg|The Cauldron Born in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\nSnapshot 2011-03-12 11-59-28.jpg|The Cauldron Born in [[Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour]].\nCauldron born.png\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7150.jpg\nCauldron Born Unknown Scene.jpg|One of the Cauldron Born in deleted scene.\nTumblr ncp34kR9Kr1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7404.jpg|The horde marches on.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7459.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7681.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7689.jpg|The Cauldron Born defeated.\nCauldron Born green.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nCauldron Born.jpg\nCauldron Born Summoned.jpg\nCauldron Born Concept Art.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nDSA Cauldron Born.png|Models for [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nDVG_Ancient_Soldiers.png\nDVG_Cauldron_Born.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Black Cauldron}}\n[[Category:Welsh characters]]\n[[Category:The Black Cauldron characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
