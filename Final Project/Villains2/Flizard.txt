Flizard is not particularly intelligent, but he means well and is more amiable in his manner than either Crock or Brat, and relatively more tolerant of the Wuzzles, but nevertheless very loyal to Crock; on occasions where Crock and Brat fall out, it is often left to Flizard to try and patch things up between them. His character essentially emphasizes tolerance of others who one is not particularly close to, while staying loyal to one's friends regardless of whether their plans are morally right or not. Flizard does not appear in every episode, only making sporadic appearances throughout the series.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFlizard covers head.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wuzzles}}\n[[Category:Wuzzles characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Lizards]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
