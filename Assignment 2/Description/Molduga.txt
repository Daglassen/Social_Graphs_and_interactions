They resemble a four-legged fish and lurk below the sand, patrolling their territory in search of prey. Once they become aware of [[Link]]'s presence, they will barrel towards Link and attempt to ram into him. Moldugas can be fought while [[Shield Surfing]] with the help of a {{Term|BotW|Sand Seal|link}}. They are very sensitive to loud noises, so they can also be fought by detonating [[Remote Bomb]]s or shooting [[Bomb Arrow]]s near them. This will cause a Molduga to fly out of the sand, stunned, and vulnerable to Link's attacks.<ref>{{Cite|You...you haven't killed any {{Color|BotW Blue|Moldugas}} yet? Here, let me give you a hint. I've noticed that they're {{Color|BotW Red|very sensitive to sound}}. If you scare them from a distance with a big noise, maybe you can stun them long enough to take them out.|Kilton|BotW}}</ref> If Link is especially quick, he can stun a Molduga as soon as its recovers.\n\nWhen defeated, a Molduga drops one or two [[Treasure Chest]]s containing various weapons, [[Molduga Fin]]s, and [[Molduga Guts]]. Link must collect Molduga Guts in order to complete the \"[[Medicinal Molduga]]\" [[Side Quest]]. After completing the \"[[Destroy Ganon]]\" [[Main Quest]], [[Kilton]] will give Link a [[Medal of Honor]] if he defeats all four Moldugas.\n\n====Locations====\n* [[Toruma Dunes]]\n* [[Southern Oasis]]\n* [[North Dragon's Exile]]\n* {{Term|BotW|Arbiter's Grounds|link}}\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Stub|HWAoC}}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\nMolduga may pay tribute to the [[Wind Temple]] [[Boss]] in [[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]], [[Molgera]], who itself has its name derived from mogura, which is Japanese for mole. The four moldugas act similar to molgera, in which they are usually submerged in sand, further supporting this claim.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Link Fighting Molduga.png|Link fighting a Molduga while riding a Sand Seal\nFile:BotW Molduga Concept Art.jpg|Concept art for a Molduga\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Molduking]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Bosses|BotW}}\n{{Categories\n |Sand-Related Enemies\n |bosses= BotW\n}}"
