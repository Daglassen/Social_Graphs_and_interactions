Ozunda is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ozunda is the owner of the Foothill Stable, where he receives incoming guests and registers Horses. When Link first meets him, Ozunda offers to teach Link about the Stable network across Hyrule which boards and registers Wild Horses to travelers, officially making them companions to the person who registers them. He also offers to teach Link how to catch Wild Horses, should he not know how.
Ozunda will also direct any travelers seeking a rest inside of the Foothill Stable, where they can stay. If Link asks to register a Horse, Ozunda will charge Link 20 Rupees to support the Stable conservation efforts and to cover the cost of a Saddle and Bridle for the new Horse companion. Upon paying the fee, Ozunda will allow Link to name his Horse. After registration, Ozunda will ask Link whether he would take the Horse with him, or if he would like to board it inside the Stable. As parting words, Ozunda will teach Link about Whistling to attract his Horse, noting that Horses have a limited range of hearing.
Ozunda is also a painter by hobby. He is the artist behind a painting hung inside the Foothill Stable's lodge, which depicts the Stable in its surrounding landscape. This painting is involved in the "A Landscape of a Stable" Shrine Quest, whose depiction provides a hint on finding the Tah Muhl Shrine.
