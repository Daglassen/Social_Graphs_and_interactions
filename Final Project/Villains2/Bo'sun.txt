Serving under command of [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]], he serves as the ship's first mate and also the ship's boatswain.\n\n==Background==\nBo'sun serves as Captain Barbossa's first mate. During his encounter with Elizabeth Swann, he slapped her for trying to state about her terms during his conversation with [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. As a member of Barbossa's crew, he follows him wherever Barbossa leads his crew.\n\n==Role in the film==\nOnboard the ''Black Pearl'', Bo'sun serves as the ship's first mate and during his encounter [[Elizabeth Swann]], [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] approaches him, replying that Bo'sun never talked about her parley to which he agrees. Later during the ritual, when it is found out that Elizabeth was not [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]]'s daughter, the curse could not be broken and thus, Elizabeth's blood did not work. When the pirates noticed that Elizabeth escaped, Bo'sun orders the pirates to find the missing oars.\n\nDuring battle against the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]'', Bo'sun fought against the motley crew who fired everything inside the ''Interceptor'' and during battle, Elizabeth was forced to walk the plank. He later fought against the ''[[HMS Dauntless]]'' and just like any cursed member, he has the ability to walk underwater and alongside the rest of the cursed crew, he prepared for an ambush on the ship. During the battle, he fought against [[Gillette]] and threw a pulley at him, but he missed, hitting Ragetti causing him to lose his wooden eye. With Barbossa defeated by [[Jack Sparrow]], Bo'sun surrendered with the remaining crew, but later survived to avoid the clutches of the British Royal Navy.\n\n==Video game appearances==\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''===\nIn the video game that is considered non-canonical to the film's universe, Bo'sun is one of the cursed pirate enemies in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' universe appearing as a generic enemy in [[Port Royal]].\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Bo'sun_(pirate) Bo'sun] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
