She becomes the tertiary antagonist of the third season.\n\n==Background==\nChatana is ancient winged sorceress who used her powerful magic to conjure terrible monsters to torture her enemies. She almost destroyed [[Maru (location)|Maru]] (the old Avalor) and [[Vallestrella]] until the Maruvians banished and sealed her away in a Maruvian vault. Her golden diadem, which was the source of her power, was lost for centuries.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nShe has dark hair, tan skin and teal eyes. She wears a green dress with blue and mint wings.\n\n==Role in the series==\nShe is first mentioned in \"[[Not Without My Magic]]\", when [[King Verago]] talks about her past.\n\nChatana makes her first appearance in \"[[The Last Laugh]]\", where she's unintentionally released from prison by [[Elena Flores|Elena]] and [[Mateo]]. She sends her Chiki Chiki, which causes uncontrollable laughter, to distract them while she and Pili go search for her diadem. Eventually, she joins forces with [[Ash Delgado|Ash]] and [[Chancellor Esteban|Esteban]], with the former promising to only give her back her diadem if she accepts to help them take over Avalor. After Pili affirms both Ash and Esteban are indeed very evil, Chatana accepts Ash's offer.\n\nIn \"[[Giant Steps]]\", Chatana, along with her new allies Ash and Esteban, recruit [[Tziloco]] into their group, and become wanted for their crimes. With Tziloco's help, they travel to Vallestrella seeking to free Chatana's strongest monster [[Kizin]]. When they discover that Elena and her team are tracking them down, Chatana uses her magic to conjure a large swarm of baby Spider Eagles to distract them. Even after they free Kizin, however, he refuses to join them due to Chatana never having gone back for him. Though Chatana claims she could not due to being captured, Kizin goes off to free his friends. After Kizin is recaptured, Ash tells Esteban, Chatana, and Tziloco that their allies from the other side of Avalor will be far more powerful, and they depart from Vallestrella.\n\nIn the series finale \"[[Coronation Day]]\" Chatana and the others travel to Nueva Vista to search for the Shadow Gateway, the barrier keeping the Shadows of the Night out of the EverRealm. Chatana finds a clue that reveals the Gateway is under the ocean. A moment after reaching the Gateway, Elena's group arrives and attacks Ash's army. During the battle, Chatana blasts Mateo with her magic then conjures a giant flying jellyfish monster. Gabe, Naomi and the Jaquins fight hard against it but without success. But then, [[Princess Isabel|Isabel]] shoots the jellyfish with one of the potion-holding arrows she invented and the spell shrinks it until it's very small much to Chatana's horror. Mateo then hits Pili with a freezing spell. Furious, Chatana prepares to conjure a Dragon Shark, but before she can finish the spell, [[Princess Marisa]] slams her to the ground knocking her diadem off and Gabe grabs it up. Before she can attempt to get it back, Migs grabs her and flies her to [[Naomi Turner|Naomi]] who quickly imprisons Chatana in her Milagro. [[Antonia Bello|Antonia]] then takes her, and the frozen Pili and Tziloco to the Summer Palace and locks them up in the tower.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" position=\"center\">\nChatana.png|Chatana is free at last.\nChatana & Pili.jpg\nChatana shuts up Pili.jpg|Chatana grabs Pili's mouth to shut him up.\nAsh-Chatana 01.jpg|\"It won't matter once we release my most powerful creature.\"\nWalking through Vallestrella.jpg\nAsh-Chatana 02.jpg|\"It's only a matter of time before they find us...\nChatana 03.jpg|unless I create a diversion.\"\nChatana 04.jpg|\"Legs of a spider Black as the night\nChatana 05.jpg|Wings of an eagle A web woven tight\nChatana 06.jpg|Fast as the wind Sharp as a bite\nChatana 07.jpg|Conjure a creature to give them a fright!\nChatana 08.jpg\n20200817 230421.jpg\nChatana-Ash 01.jpg\nChatana 012.jpg\nChatana 013.jpg|\"I found something!\"\nChatana 014.jpg\nChatana 015.jpg\nEvil group.jpg\nChatana 015-0.jpg|\"Jellyfish, grow kraken size..\nChatana 016.jpg|with mighty wings and opal eyes.\"\nJellyfish monster.jpg\nChatana 017.jpg|\"Look what she did to my baby!\"\nChatana-Mateo.jpg|\"You will regret that!\"\nChatana 018.jpg|\"Tiburon teeth and Dragon fire-\"\nChatana 019.jpg\nChatana 019-0.jpg\nChatana 020.jpg\nChatana caught.jpg\nNaomi captures Chatana with the expanding sack.jpg|Naomi captures Chatana with the inflating sack.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[pt-br:Chatana]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
