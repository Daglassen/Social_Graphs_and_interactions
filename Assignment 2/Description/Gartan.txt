It is now!|Gartan|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhile {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Naboris|link}} is still active, Gartan reveals that it makes traveling to {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Town}} from {{Term|BotW|Kara Kara Bazaar|link}} dangerous.<ref>{{Cite|That old {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} makes the road between {{Color|BotW Blue|Kara Kara Bazaar}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Town}} a dangerous place.|Gartan|BotW}}</ref> However, he says it will not stop him from meeting {{Term|BotW|Gerudo}} ladies.<ref>{{Cite|But I'm too keen on getting to know those Gerudo ladies to let that stop me!
