For their first appearance, the Trolls are depicted multicolored, while all later appearances have them share a toxic green complexion. \n\nTheir leader, Clutch, is the smartest of the bunch, and often uses his pod shooter to scar his victims. He commandeers a larger gang of trolls, but is mostly seen with his two main lackeys, Nip (red nose, first apearing yellow-orange-faced) and Tuck (purple hair, part of the group from their second appearance on).\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nTrolls are creatures known to be thieves, that appear in ''Once Upon a Time'', native to the [[Enchanted Forest]]. Before the first curse, a group of them made a deal with [[Snow White]], buying several stolen jewels from her. When Snow returned to the troll bridge under which they lived in order to revert the deal and retrieve the jewels to their rightful owner, Prince Charming, the head troll become suspicious that they were being set up and got aggressive, engaging in a fight with the prince, and ultimately being transformed into a bug by Snow White.\n\n==Episodes==\n*''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'':\n**\"[[Over the River and Through the Trolls]]\"\n**\"[[A Tree Grows in Dunwyn]]\"\n**\"[[Beg, Burrow and Steal]]\"\n**\"[[Friar Tum]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n===''Adventures of the Gummi Bears''===\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-OverTheRiverAndThroughTheTrolls-MulticoloredTrolls.png|The Trolls' first appearance in \"Over the River and Through the Trolls\"\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-GummiGlenHostages03.png|The Trolls in \"A Tree Grows in Dunwyn\"\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-GummiGlenHostages01.png|Clutch\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-NipTroll.png|Nip\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-TuckTrollAndNipTroll.png|Tuck and Nip\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-GummiGlenHostages04.png|The Gummies with Tuck and Nip\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-TuckTrollAndSunniGummi01.png|Tuck and [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]]\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-TuckTrollAndSunniGummi02.png|Tuck and Sunni\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-GruffiGummiAndClutchTroll01.png|Clutch and [[Gruffi Gummi|Gruffi]]\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-GruffiGummiAndClutchTroll02.png|Gruffi and Clutch\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-TheTreeAndTrollsNoseColorGoof.png|The Trolls' nose color goof\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ATreeGrowsInDunwyn-ThePresent.png|The Trolls with [[Princess Calla|Calla]] and [[King Gregor]]\n</gallery>\n\n===''Once Upon a Time''===\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nOnce Upon a Time - 1x03 - Snow Falls - Bridge Trolls.png|Bridge Trolls in ''Once Upon a Time''\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Trolls}}\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Trolls]]\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
