When visiting Oscorp Tower on a field trip, Spencer insisted Alistair be paired with [[Harry Osborn]], a former Midtown student who had joined the student group for his friend [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].\n\nWhen the tour guide asked for volunteers to try out a two-manned robot, Alistair attempted to come forward, but Harry stopped him to suggest Peter and his trip partner [[Liz Allan]] went instead, much to Alistair's annoyance. He later applied to Osborn Academy for Geniuses, being accepted sometime later.\n\nAfter [[Vulture (Marvel)|Vulture]] was released from prison and given a teaching position at Osborn Academy, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] told him to go to Horizon High to steal the V-252. He refused, however, Alistair volunteered to do it for him.\n\nAt the Stark Expo, Alistair, Vulture, and a few Osborn Academy students in Vulture suits tried to combat [[Ghost]], but Ghost made their suits malfunction.\n\n==Trivia==\n*This is the first teenage adaptation of the character.\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smythe, Alistair}}\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
