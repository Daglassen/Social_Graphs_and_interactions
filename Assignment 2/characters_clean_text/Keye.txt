Keye is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Keye is a Zora child who can be found playing around Mipha's statue in Zora's Domain.
He is much more reserved than his brother, but can also be seen as a bit more rude: when Link asks him how he is doing while his mother is away, Keye tells Link to leave him alone. In his first dialogue with Link, he tells Link that his father forbade him to talk to strangers.
After Divine Beast Vah Ruta has been calmed, Link can ask Keye what he's doing. Keye will respond that he's practicing his spear moves and will jab his stick towards the ground. He laments that he can't jump very high.
