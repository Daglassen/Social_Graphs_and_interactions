The duo (voiced by [[Loren Hoskins]] and [[Kevin Hendrickson]] with [[Jeff Bennett]] providing his animated speaking voice), also known as \"'''The Never Land Pirate Band'''\", were members of a family-oriented \"pirate rock\" band in Portland, [[Oregon]] called \"Captain Bogg and Salty\". These two pirate musicians are minions of Captain James Hook and are supporting characters in Jake and the Never Land Pirates.\n\n==Background==\nTheir involvement with Disney began in [[2009|2007]] when Bobs Gannaway, creator and executive producer of the series, was looking for good music to listen to for the pilot, Hide the Hideout. Hoskins and Hendrickson have introduced shortly afterward to Disney Television Animation executive vice president of music Jay Stutler, and they agreed to be the musical directors, writing the theme music as well as additional songs for the series. Hoskins is an actor by trade, while Hendrickson was working in the City of Portland as a web developer when Disney came in and gave them the chance to perform. Later, it was decided by Gallaway and his team they would work as an animated \"[[Wikipedia:Greek Chorus|Greek Chorus]]\" for [[Captain Hook]] and [[Mr. Smee]].\n\nThe duo has made promotional appearances for the show, including appearances at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] and the biannual D23 Expo in Anaheim.\n\nSharky and Bones also attended the 20th Annual Festival of Lights Parade in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n\nPuppet versions of their animated selves can be seen in ''Disney Junior Live'' at Disney's Hollywood Studios and [[Disney California Adventure]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===\n[[File:SharkyBonesPromoPicture.jpg|thumb|250px|Sharky and Bones (Loren Hoskins and Kevin Hendrickson) in a public relations picture for ''Jake and the Never Land Pirates''.]]\nIn the animated series, their animated counterparts are members of [[Pirate Crew (Peter Pan)|Captain Hook's crew]]\u00a0and around\u00a0the first few episodes, Sharky and Bones provided musical numbers and never actually took part in the main plot. Later on, they began joining Hook and [[Mr. Smee|Smee]] in their schemes involving [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and the others but unlike Smee, however, Sharky and Bones take pride in their work as villainous pirates and show to have a great fear of Captain Hook. At the end of every set of episodes (except \"[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Battle for the Book]]\" as it was [[Maia Mitchell]] who stood at the end [the voice of Wendy in the special]), the two in their live-action forms, perform an original song often based on one of the two episodes.\n\nThe first episode to solely revolve around the duo was \"[[Peter's Musical Pipes]]\". Here, for failing to complete their chores, Captain Hook forces the duo to walk the plank (which means being fired in a pirate's life). After their discharge, Sharky and Bones help Jake's crew who are coincidentally searching for a treasure that requires musical talents and the use of Peter Pan's pipes, which they already have in their possessions, in order to be found. Hook spots Sharky and Bones working with the pirates and follows them to the treasure of Peter Pan's pipes. Hook steals the pipes but doesn't know how to play, preventing him from revealing the treasure. Sharky volunteers to play it if Hook hires him and Bones and promises never to have them walk the plank again. Hook agrees. The treasure is revealed and the pipes are returned to Jake by Bones. Hook still decides to steal the pipes but Jake and his crew escape. Hook forgets the situation and makes way for the Jolly Roger. There, he orders Sharky and Bones to complete their work and play some music, which they gladly do.\n\nAnother episode to do is \"[[Captain Hook's Hooks]]\". In this story, Sharky and Bones accidentally dirty some of Hook's hooks in his cabinet. The duo is ordered to clean them but the hooks are stolen by [[Octopus (Peter Pan)|The Octopus]] who wants to play with them. Knowing they'll have to walk the plank if the captain finds out, Sharky and Bones travel to Never Land and teams up with the Never Land Pirates to retrieve the eight stolen hooks. They are retrieved and the hooks are restored. However, in the mix of getting them back, the hooks are filthily again, even more. They are forced to walk the plank but are caught by the Octopus down below who bounces them on his tentacles for fun. Smee joins in the fun with Hook deciding to forgive them and join in, too.\n\nAnother episode that focuses on Sharky and Bones is \"[[Song of the Desert]]\". Captain Hook uses Sharky and Bones to lure [[Captain Flynn]] away from the [[Pirate Pyramid]] allowing him and Smee to raid the pyramid to find Captain Flynn's treasure the Golden Scarab.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode \"[[Pirate Swap!]]\", Bones collected two gold doubloons, making him the first and only member of Hook's crew who has interacted with the gold doubloons so far.\n*The Black Electric Guitar Bones played in music videos is a Black Ibanez GRG120BDX Electric Guitar with white skull and crossbones stickers, and the Banjo is a 4-string Deering Boston 19-Fret Tenor Banjo with a big black, and small white skull and crossbones stickers.\n**Later, in other music videos, Bones played a variety of electric guitars, a mandolin, a new banjo, a 4-string bass guitar, 2 different acoustic guitars, and ukuleles.\n\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Live! characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Ninjas]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
