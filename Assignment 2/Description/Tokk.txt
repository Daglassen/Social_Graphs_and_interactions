He usually spends his time sitting on a stool out by an {{Term|BotW|Apple|link}} {{Term|BotW|Tree|link}} in his yard. {{Term|BotW|Tokk}} is not a forthcoming man, often sighing when spoken to.<ref>{{Cite|[Hullo!] *sigh* Hullo.|Tokk|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|[Good-bye.] *sigh*|Tokk|BotW}}</ref>\n\n{{Term|BotW|Link|link}} can ask to speak to {{Term|BotW|Tokk}} about a few different topics.<ref>{{Cite| What is it? [I need to talk to you.] To me? About what?|Tokk|BotW}}</ref> Should the hero ask about the {{Term|BotW|Great Calamity|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Tokk}} wonders if {{Term|BotW|Uma|link}} may have put him up to this.<ref>{{Cite| [Calamity Ganon?] The {{Color|BotW Blue|Calamity}}? Did Uma put some ideas in your head? What good is sniffing around on a thing that happened 100 years ago?|Tokk|BotW}}</ref> Although he sees no real reason behind {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s curiosity, {{Term|BotW|Tokk}} relinquishes what he learned about the Calamity from his father.<ref>{{Cite| I can tell you what my father told me, but I don\u2019t see what good it will do...|Tokk|BotW}}</ref> He tells {{Term|BotW|Link}} about how {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle|link}} was \"contaminated\" and how the {{Term|BotW|Great Calamity}} wiped out nearly everything.<ref>{{Cite| The {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}} was a catastrophe that...contaminated {{Color|BotW Blue|Hyrule Castle}}. That\u2019s how I understood it, anyway. Our world was once filled with beautiful cities and prosperous villages, but the {{Color|BotW Blue|Calamity}} destroyed all of that.|Tokk|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Tokk}} is thankful that Hateno Village managed to survive the disaster due to its far-off location.<ref>{{Cite| Luckily, Hateno Village was far enough away from {{Color|BotW Blue|Hyrule Castle}} that the damage here was minor in comparison.|Tokk|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Tokk}} also recalls that someone attempted to put an end to the Calamity, but he is quick to dismiss the entire topic as irrelevant.<ref>{{Cite|And then there was something about a brave soul that tried to stop the {{Color|BotW Blue|Calamity}}, I think... I don\u2019t remember it all. What does it matter, though? That\u2019s all in the past.|Tokk|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link asks about the place he is in, Tokk at first believes he is inquiring about the farm.<ref>{{Cite|[What is this place?] Well...it\u2019s a farm. But you knew that much, right?|Tokk|BotW}}</ref> However, he is quick to realize that Link likely means the {{Term|BotW|Hateno Ancient Tech Lab}} above them and tells him that a {{Term|BotW|Sheikah|link|display=Sheikah tribe}} {{Term|BotW|Purah|link|display=member}} is conducting research there.<ref>{{Cite|OH! Are you talking about that odd house up top there? The place on that hill to the east is the {{Color|BotW Blue|research lab}}. I heard a {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah tribe director}} is doing some mysterious things up there.\n|Tokk|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can ask who {{Term|BotW|Tokk}} himself is, but the elder will humbly admit he is naught but an old man.<ref>{{Cite|[Who are you?] Me? Well, I\u2019m just an old man. Nothing more to it than that.|Tokk|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt 5:00 AM, Tokk wakes up to go to his usual stool outside. He will not discuss anything until he has a seat.<ref>{{Cite|I don\u2019t mind chatting with you, but let me have a seat first.|Tokk|BotW}}</ref> Should it rain while he is outside, he will sit inside until it stops. At 9:00 PM, he considers the day to be over and goes to bed.<ref>{{Cite|I\u2019m going to bed. See you.|Tokk|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Tokk's and Koyin's House.png|{{Term|BotW|Tokk}}'s and {{Term|BotW|Koyin}}'s {{Term|BotW|House}}\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hateno Villagers, Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
