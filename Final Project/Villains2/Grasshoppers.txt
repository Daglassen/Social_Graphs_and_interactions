They are notorious in bullying the ants into collecting food for them. When they are not terrorizing the insects of [[Ant Island]], the grasshoppers are seen in [[Hopper's Hideout]].\n\n==Background==\nUnder the tyranny of Hopper, the [[Ant Colony]] annually collects food for the grasshoppers during the springtime. If the food is not sufficient enough for the grasshoppers or if the food for the Offering Stone is lost, the ants receive consequences from the grasshoppers and their leader Hopper for the loss of their food. However, during Flik's plans to find tougher bugs to fight against the grasshoppers, Flik managed to devise a strategical plan to fight against them along with the whole ant colony and the Circus Bugs. Thanks to this, the battle was successful and the ants no longer collected food for the grasshoppers as they were all banished from Ant Island with Hopper eaten alive.\n\n===Members===\n<tabber>\nHopper=\n{{Main|Hopper}}\n|-|Molt=\n{{Main|Molt}}\n|-|Thumper=\n{{Main|Thumper (A Bug's Life)}}\n|-|Axel and Loco=\n[[File:Loco.png|left|150px]]\nAn unusual duo of grasshoppers that are part of Hopper's army, Axel and Loco have a different size comparison. Loco is taller than his companion Axel who is shorter than tough with one of his antennae cut in half. During Hopper's plan to take over Ant Island, he buries the duo in a large pile of grain. Despite this, the aforementioned duo can be seen during the plan to scare off the grasshoppers with help from the circus troupe, implying that they weren't killed by the incident.\n\nAxel is voiced by [[Jan Rabson]] and Loco is voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]].\n</tabber>\n\n==Role in the film==\nAfter Flik causes all the food for the grasshoppers to fall into the water, a gang of grasshoppers begins to descend downward toward the ant colony, attacking them for losing their food. Hopper then warns the ants that if the last leaf falls and the ants do not collect enough food, the grasshoppers plan to take over Ant Island as Hopper's evil plan.\n\nLater in Hopper's hideout after spending a vacation there, Hopper thinks of traveling back to [[Ant Island]] to get food before winter. However, after, the last leaf falls during Flik's banishment during the climax of the film, the grasshoppers take complete control of Ant Island after Flik along with the Circus Bugs was wrongfully banished by Atta and her mother until the ant colony finally fights back and take their island back in which they retreat (without Hopper) defeated. After this, it is unknown what became of the grasshoppers or where they escaped to; however, Hopper is devoured by the [[Bird (A Bug's Life)|bird's]] chicks after [[Flik]] and [[Princess Atta]] lure him to her nest, and [[Molt]] moves to [[Bug City]] and joins [[Circus Bugs#P.T. Flea|P.T. Flea]]'s [[P.T. Flea's Circus|circus]] act.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDSA-Grasshopper.png|Model In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*They are based on the bandits from ''Seven Samurai'' and ''The Magnificent Seven'', with Hopper being the equivalent of Calvera from the latter movie.\n\n{{PixarWiki|Grasshoppers}}\n{{A Bug's Life}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:A Bug's Life characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Grasshoppers and crickets]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]"
