A second chance you can call it.|Viola to [[Freddy Malick]]|The New Deal}}\n\n'''Viola''' is a character on the [[Marvel Television|Marvel]]/[[ABC]] series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. She first appears in \"[[The New Deal]]\". She is an affiliate of [[HYDRA]], with ties to the Malick family, and is responsible for tasking [[Freddy Malick]], with delivering the [[Super Soldier Serum|super soldier serum]], which transforms Johann Schmidt, into the [[Red Skull]]. She is portrayed by Nora Zehetner.\n\n==History==\nAt an unknown point in time, Viola became tied to the organisation, known as [[HYDRA]], and worked with the head of the Malick family, who was also part of the same organisation. She held him in great esteem and admiration, until the Great Depression, where he lost all his wealth, leaving him to commit suicide. Viola gets ahold of vials of an unfinished [[Super Soldier Serum|serum]] created by [[Abraham Erskine|Dr. Abraham Erskine]], set to be delivered to [[Red Skull|Johann Schmidt]], at Hell's Harbor.<ref name=\"TND\">\"[[The New Deal]]\"</ref>\n\nIn [[1931]], she arranges a meeting with [[Freddy Malick|Wilfred Malick]], the son of her work associate. She meets with Freddy at a political party, hosted for FDR, and the two leave the bar, to talk more privately in the corridor. She explains her history and former admiration for Freddy's father, before presenting him with the opportunity, to restore his family's former legacy, by delivering a set of vials, of the serum, to the docks. Freddy questions what they are, and she ominously refers to them, as \"the future\". As he accepts, they are approached by Chronicom Hunters, disguised as policeman, aiming to terminate Freddy. They attempt to shoot him, but Viola is injured instead, and during the scuffly, some of the vial spills on her shoe. As the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents fight off the Chronicoms and evacuate Freddy, [[Phil Coulson (LMD)|Coulson]] escorts her unconscious body, to [[Gemini (Marvel)|Koenig]]'s bar, where [[Jemma Simmons|Simmons]] can help heal her.<ref name=\"TND\"/>\n\nSimmons manages to medicate her, but the group are forced to hide themselves in a saferoom, when the Chornicoms arrive, in search of Freddy. At that moment, Viola wakes up, and attempts to scream for help, but is smothered by Simmons and [[Quake|Daisy]] instead. In an effort to get attention, she kicks a nearby box, breaking a glass bottle on top of it, to no luck. They accompany her out of the room, and Daisy promises to take her to the hospital, if she reveals her motives for meeting with Freddy. The seriousness of the injury however, leaves Viola in a flushed state, and she is unable to give a direct response. Simmons inspects her passport, and finds travel stamps, tied to [[Germany]]. She also notes the substance on her shoe, which she manages to successfully identify, through analysis, letting the group know, she is connected to [[HYDRA]]. Now aware of the threat she potentially poses, Daisy shows more hostility when interrogating her. Viola refuses to inform the group where Freddy is making his delivery, under the impression they want to stop him, but Coulson notes they only want to find their friends. She\u00a0then divulges that they plan to meet in Hell's Harbor, though states it\u00a0won't\u00a0be possible for them to arrive on time, unless they can fly.<ref>\"[[Know Your Onions]]\"</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x02 - Know Your Onions - Photography - Interrogation.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:HYDRA agents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]"
