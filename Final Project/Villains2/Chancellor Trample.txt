At the time of [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and [[King Louie#TaleSpin|Louie]]'s arrival, he hatches another scheme to marry Amok's daughter Princess [[Lotta Lamour]], as the three of them attempt to uncover the plot despite him having his own small army of Royal Guard rhinos at his command.\n\nWhen Trample's plans go awry, he confesses his crimes, begging to be locked up and tortured rather than having to endure any more of Baloo and Louie's antics, which all parties agree to heartily.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTaleSpin-The-Road-To-Macadamia-001-400x300.png\nLotta059.jpg\nmac38.jpg\nChancellor Trample.jpg\nChancellor-Trample.jpg\nLotta109.jpg\nLotta170.jpg\nmac30.jpg\nmac77.jpg\nTrampleceiling.png\nmac85.jpg\nconvictmejailmetortureme.png\nTalespin - 160 - the road to macadamia Video - Rediff Videos2.jpg|Trample's defeat and imprisonment  \n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{TaleSpin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
