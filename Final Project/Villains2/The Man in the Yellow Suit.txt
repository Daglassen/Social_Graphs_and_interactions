He is also looking for [[Winnie Jackson Foster|Winnie Foster]], a 15-year-old girl which is with them. He heard stories from his grandmother about the spring water that keeps them \"living forever\". When he finally finds them, he tells his plans, decides if his grandmother's stories are true, and shoots Jesse in the chest, but he survives. Then he threatens them to tell where the spring is or he will shoot Winnie. Mae, angry about this, gets Angus' shotgun and whacks him in the head. He dies on impact, leaving Mae in rage and the rest safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is a clear reference to [[w:c:curious-george:Ted Shackleford|The Man in the Yellow Hat]] from the ''[[w:c:curious-george:George|Curious George]]'' {{WikipediaLink|Curious George#Books|books}}, {{WikipediaLink|Curious George (franchise)|films}}, and {{WikipediaLink|Curious George (TV series)|television series}}, as they both share similarities in name and yellow clothing.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\ntuck-disneyscreencaps.com-1282.jpg\nTuck04.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Man in the Yellow Suit, The}}\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Tuck Everlasting characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
