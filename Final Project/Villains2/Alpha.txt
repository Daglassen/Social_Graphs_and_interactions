He is\u00a0the leader of [[Charles Muntz]]'s pack of dogs.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Up]]''===\nAlpha is a blue and ochre Doberman Pinscher owned by [[Charles Muntz]]. He is the leader of the dog pack and is usually found with [[Beta and Gamma]], his lieutenants. Like [[Dug]], he has a collar that allows him to talk, but a minor malfunction makes him sound as if he'd been inhaling helium, giving him\u00a0a\u00a0squeaky voice. The real voice for Alpha's translator chip (after Muntz fixes his collar) is a deep, intimidating voice. [[Russell]] says he likes the high-pitched voice better than the intimidating one.\n\nAlpha has a very condescending and proud disposition, and looks down on all the other dogs in the pack. When Dug fails to bring the bird [[Kevin]] to Alpha, he puts Dug in the \"Cone of Shame\". In the climax of the film, Alpha clashes with Dug inside [[Spirit of Adventure|the airship]] until Dug finally defeats Alpha by trapping him under the helm and sticking a conical airship instrument housing over the Doberman's head as the \"Cone of Shame\". Alpha breaks his collar, making his voice high-pitched again, which causes the other dogs to ridicule him and (after Dug commands the original Alpha to sit) bestow the \"Alpha\" title upon Dug. Following his defeat, he is seen at Russell's promotion ceremony in the film's closing scenes, still wearing the \"Cone of Shame\". The ending credits suggest he becomes a pet of one of the residents at the [[Shady Oaks Retirement Village]].\n\nIn the background, he can be seen panting with happiness once Charles says \"treat\" to [[Carl Fredricksen|Carl]] and Russell.\n\n===''[[Dug's Special Mission]]''===\nAlpha, [[Beta and Gamma]] are chasing [[Kevin]] when [[Dug]] accidentally trips them, causing them to lose the bird. Alpha tells Dug to \"watch the bird's ''favorite'' rock and tell them if it moves.\" Dug accidentally knocks the large rock over, almost squashing Alpha and the rest of the pack. Alpha then tells him to sit in the ''bird's favorite hole'' and, while giving a speech to his packmates, gets buried by Dug, who sank through the hole. Alpha is shown getting beat up several more times until he calls \"master\" to tell him that Dug caused them to lose the bird and that he is a bad dog.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The howling wolf in ''[[Day & Night]]'' is actually a modified version of Alpha, similar to how background humans in Pixar films are created from a \"Universal Man\" as a base.\n*It should be noted that Alpha is the character's rank in the pack, rather than his name, as [[Dug]] becomes the new Alpha after defeating him.\n*Alpha is a Greek letter of the alphabet, along with Beta and Gamma.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|pixar|Alpha|Pixar Wiki}}\n\n{{Up}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[es:Alpha]]\n[[fi:Alfa]]\n[[pt-br:Alpha]]\n[[Category:Up characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
