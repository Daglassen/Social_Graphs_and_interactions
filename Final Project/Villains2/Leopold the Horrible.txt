In the wake of the warlock's defeat, Leopold was mummified and sealed in an Egyptian casket kept in [[Clinton Coot]]'s cabana, being reawakened shortly after Felldrake's staff was discovered by [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]].\n\nLeopold is a chimera of parts from many different animals (most notably it has aspects of bats, cats, rats, gorillas, monkeys, and donkeys), with the Caballeros describing him as a \"Monkey-Bat-Donkey-Rat\", though [[April, May, and June]] identify him as possibly being a Chupacabra.\n\n===Personality===\nThough ferocious to his enemies, Leopold has a very gentle nature when interacting with his masters, hating to see them bicker and seeing them as parental figures. Felldrake in turn is very kind and doting to his beloved flying mount and sees him as the best way to travel.\n\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
