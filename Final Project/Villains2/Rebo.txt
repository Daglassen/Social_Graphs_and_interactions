In the 1960s Carlo Chendi and Luciano Bottaro decided to reuse the character in Disney stories: Rebo made his debut in Disney stories in ''Paperino e il razzo interplanetario'' (literally ''Donald Duck and the interplanetary rocket'', 1960) in which he tries to conquer Jupiter but his plans fail thanks to Donald. Luciano Bottaro created in the 1990s other three stories about Rebo and his attempts to conquer Earth and Jupiter.\n\n==Disney stories==\nIn 1960, Italian [[Disney]] artists Carlo Chendi (script) and Luciano Bottaro (art) created a story, ''Paperino e il razzo interplanetario'' (literally ''Donald Duck and the interplanetary rocket''), in which Rebo made his debut in Disney comics. In this story Rebo is the farcical dictator of Saturn, whose population was reduced (because of war) to a total of three (Rebo and his two helpers). Rebo wants to conquer Jupiter. When he finds out that the famous inventor [[Gyro Gearloose]] is on Jupiter with [[Donald Duck]], [[Scrooge McDuck]], and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], he decides to kidnap him to force him to create fighting robots. Unfortunately his helpers mistake Donald Duck for Gyro, so they kidnap him. Donald Duck is forced by Rebo to create fighting robots, but thanks to Donald's inability, they are ineffective so the invasion of Jupiter fails. Donald escapes and returns to Jupiter where he is celebrated as a hero by Jupiter's inhabitants.\n\nIn 1995, Luciano Bottaro decided to create new adventures about Rebo. In 1995 he created ''Paperino e il ritorno di Rebo'' (literally ''Donald Duck and the return of Rebo'') in which Rebo tries to conquer Earth but his plans fail thanks to Donald and Scrooge. Bottaro made other two stories about Rebo, ''Alla ricerca del papero virtuale'' (literally ''Finding the virtual duck'', 1995) and ''Paperino e l'invasione di Giove'' (literally ''Donald Duck and the invasion of Jupiter'', 1997). In the ''Invasion of Jupiter'', Bottaro reused Zantaf, a mad scientist appeared in the 1970s in some ''MIA'' (McDuck Intelligence Agency, in Italian PIA) stories. In this story Zantaf allied with Rebo.\n\nIn 2010, the four Disney stories about Rebo were republished in the volume ''Tesori #7: Paperino contro Saturno'' (literally ''Treasures #7: Donald Duck against Saturn''). In the USA none of the stories about Rebo (excluding ''Saturn against the Earth'') have been published yet.\n\n{{Wikipedia}}\n[[Category:Articles with Wikipedia content]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]"
