They share the same qualities with the original in terms of physical appearance, abilities, weaknesses, and personality. Their one true place is in [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]].\n\n==Background==\nSince they are like the original Leroy, the clones all share his personality, appearance, and abilities. They are vicious and love to cause destruction as much as the original Leroy. They're also cunning and intelligent, as the clones use their numbers to take down the experiments in their fight.\n\nThey also share their love for [[Elvis Presley]]'s music, as they all danced to \"[[Jailhouse Rock]]\" in their prison cells.\n\nHowever, Leroy was programmed with a fail-safe during his creation. Since the clones share his abilities and characteristics, they also share his weakness to shut down when they hear the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\".\n\nThe clones are also immune to some of the experiments' powers, since Leroy is created after them, they are immune to [[Angel]]'s song. However, they aren't immune to all of them, as some of them are affected by [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]] and [[Babyfier]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nAfter [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]] were defeated by [[Leroy]] (though the original won unfairly, given the untimely arrival of Pleakley during Leroy and Stitch's battle), [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel]] cloned him into a huge army. The original Leroy then took over the [[B.R.B. 9000|B.R.B.]] by posing as Stitch, the captain, and ordered that the [[Galactic Armada|pilots]] take him, H\u00e4msterviel, and the Leroy army to [[Planet Turo|Turo]].\n\nMeanwhile, after [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Reuben]] left to help Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley, a Leroy clone arrived on Earth, where he rounded up all of the first 624 experiments there (along with [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] while capturing [[Gigi]]) and brought them to a stadium to be destroyed.\n\nShortly after, H\u00e4msterviel and the entire Leroy army arrived at the stadium on Earth in the BRB to destroy the captured experiments. Before they could, however, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, [[Reuben]] and a reformed Gantu arrived, and a battle ensued between the experiments and the Leroy clones.\n\nThough the experiments were able to overpower the Leroys at first, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand. However, as the Leroys came close to winning the battle, Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused all the Leroys (including the original one) to shut down due to the original's fail-safe.\n\nAll of the Leroys were then sent to prison on [[Prison Asteroid K-37|Asteroid K-37]], where they were seen happily dancing to the song \"[[Jailhouse Rock]]\" with an angry Dr. H\u00e4msterviel tapping his foot.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dr. H\u00e4msterviel cloning Leroy could possibly mirror his failed attempt to clone Stitch in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''.\n*According to the DVD scene selection, there are about 50,000 Leroy clones.\n*The development of the Leroy clones is almost similar to the [[Clone Troopers]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.\n*One of the Leroy clones had almost all his fur chipped away by Clip, since all the clones share the same abilities as the real Leroy, it is unknown why the Leroy clone didn't simply regrow his fur.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]"
