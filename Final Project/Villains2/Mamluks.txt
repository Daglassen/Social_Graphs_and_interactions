At some point, likely when Mozenrath felt that Destane had nothing left to teach him, he killed Destane and turned him into one of his undead Mamluks, before taking over his throne. The Mamluk soldiers have secure control over the Land of the Black Sand, but they are not powerful enough to conquer the other kingdoms that Mozenrath wants to rule.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]"
