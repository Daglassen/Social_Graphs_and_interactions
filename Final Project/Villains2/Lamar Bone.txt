He also was so serious and uptight about his job and his enforcement of rules that he even feels bound to follow the same rules himself to the most absolute degree, as evidenced by one time where he had a nervous breakdown when he realized he actually broke one the rules he created when Doug pointed it out to him when serving Saturday Detention to Doug and his friends. Nonetheless, despite his uptightness, he has demonstrated some degree of fairness as well, as evidenced when, after realizing after initially assuming that Doug looked at the test answers that Doug never even opened the envelope containing them, let him off with a small warning. He is also demonstrated to be somewhat literal-minded, as evidenced by, in the aforementioned incident with the test answers mixup, his initially thinking that Doug was referring to an aquatic animal and denies seeing one before the principal corrected him and explained that Doug was actually referring to the seal on the envelope. In his personal life, he enjoys yodeling and clog dancing which have earned him many accolades and trophies\u2014some of which he kept at Bluffington Elementary. On that note, he also acts as a teacher for yodeling on his own spare time on the weekends, which also contributed to his aforementioned breakdown after realizing he himself had to be subject to Saturday Detention after he obliviously violated his rule of not snatching drawings, as that meant he was forced to miss his class.\n\nHis nephew Percy Femur visits on occasion. Percy is extremely large and muscular for his age and\u00a0is a much more aggressive bully than [[Roger Klotz|Roger]] is. Mr. Bone was initially unaware of his nephew's bullying nature, which resulted in Roger frequently escaping by claiming Mr. Bone was nearby, although as soon as Mr. Bone became privy to Percy being a bully, Mr. Bone proceeded to drag Percy away and presumably punish him severely.\n\n==Alter egos==\n*Robobone\n*Rulemeister\n*The Quizzler\n\n==Trivia==\n*One of Lamar Bone's alter egos, The Quizzler, is a clear reference to the ''Batman'' villain The Riddler. Coincidentally, the Quizzler shares a similar backstory about cheating in an event to the Riddler in some continuities.\n*Ironically, Lamar's voice actor shares the same name as the person he frequently antagonizes.\n* Mr. Bone's speech and appearance is akin to [[Don Knotts]].\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDoug Cut School.jpg\nDoug Cut School (1).jpg\nDoug Cut School (2).jpg\nDoug's Last Birthday (16).jpg\nDoug Cut School (3).jpg\nDoug Cut School (4).jpg\nDoug Cut School (5).jpg\nDoug Cut School (7).jpg\nDoug Cut School (8).jpg\nDoug Cut School (9).jpg\nDoug Cut School (10).jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5.jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (1).jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (14).jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (15).jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (18).jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (21).jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (22).jpg\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (27).jpg\nDoug's Secret of Sucess.jpg\nDoug's Secret of Sucess (1).jpg\nDoug's Secret of Sucess (2).jpg\nDoug's Secret of Sucess (3).jpg\nDoug's Secret of Sucess (7).jpg\nDoug's Secret of Sucess (9).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Doug}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bone, Lamar}}\n[[Category:Doug characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Principals]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Judges]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
