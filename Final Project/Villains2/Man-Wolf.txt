He is the son of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and an astronaut for N.A.S.A. The reason why is being due to his estranged relationship with his father like in the Marvel Comics.\u00a0However, the discovery of the Godstone during a space expedition causes him to transform into the lycanthropic '''Man-Wolf'''. He debuts in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode \"The Man-Wolf\".\n\nMan-Wolf was created by\u00a0[[Stan Lee]]\u00a0and Steve Ditko.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nIn his human form, John Jameson is a Caucasian man with blond hair. In his Man-Wolf form, he looks like a classic werewolf covered in white fur with an armor and wields a sword.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nAs the Man-Wolf, John Jameson has incredible speed, strength, and senses. \u00a0He has razor sharp claws, and a sword. In addition, he can allude Spider-Man's Spider sense, breath in space, and absorb energy.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\nSpider-Man's team and S.H.I.E.L.D. answer a distress signal coming from J. Jonah Jameson to look for John Jameson on the moon, where John was supervising the construction of a Daily Bugle communications station. Onsite, however, the construction crew found the remains of an advanced civilization harboring a number of strange jewels, one of which embedded itself in John's chest and triggered his transformation into the feral Man-Wolf (with the trappings and the sword used by Stargod). Spider-Man manages to shatter the jewel, but the sudden reversion causes John to retain some wolf-like appearance and features, whereupon he is kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody for treatment.\n\n===''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''===\nIn the episode \"Osborn Academy\", John Jameson is among the people that audition for a spot in Osborn Academy where he shows his space program knowledge. In the episode \"Halloween Moon\", John Jameson and Harry Osborn worked on an experiment that involved a lunar crystal that fed off gamma radiation which turned John Jameson into Man-Wolf whose scratch turned those who were struck by Man-Wolf's claws into werewolves. It took Spider-Man, Hulk, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn to undo the effects of the Man-Wolf transformations and cure the infected. While Norman Osborn was displeased that he got Harry involved upon being given the lunar crystal, John Jameson stated the Man-Wolf form had a different personality as Norman Osborn plans to find a way to fix the lunar crystal's effects.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMan-Wolf USM.png|As the Man-Wolf\n34 2.jpg|As John\nJohn Jameson asking Spider-Man for help USM.png\nJohn Jameson in stasis USM.png\nJohn Jameson Nova Spider-Man Iron Fist USM.png\nJohn Jameson USM 1.png\nJohn Jameson USM 2.png\nJohn Jameson USM 3.png\nJohn Jameson USM.png\nMan-Wolf USM 1.png\nMan-Wolf USM 2.png\nMan-Wolf USM 3.png\nMan-Wolf USM 4.png\nMan-Wolf USM 5.png\nMan-Wolf USM 6.png\nMan-Wolf USM 7.png\nMan-Wolf USM 8.png\nMan-Wolf USM 9.png\nMan-Wolf & Spider-Man USM.png\nFile:Marvel spiderman werewolf by giuseppedirosso dbrh5qf-pre.jpg\nFile:Marvel spiderman werewolf 1 by giuseppedirosso dbrh5uh-pre.jpg\nFile:Marvel spiderman werewolf 4 by giuseppedirosso dbrh662-pre.jpg\nFile:Marvel spiderman werewolf 5 by giuseppedirosso dbrh68f-pre.jpg\nFile:Marvel spiderman werewolf 6 by giuseppedirosso dbrh6bd-pre.jpg\nFile:Marvel spiderman werewolf 7 by giuseppedirosso dbrh6f7-pre.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Werecreatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
