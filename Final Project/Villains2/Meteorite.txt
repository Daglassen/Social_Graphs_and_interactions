A [[Kree]] gem gives her the ability to fly, the ability to phase through solid objects, the able to shoot energy beams from her hands and the ability to control gravity, and she uses these powers as Moonstone to try and take over the world and destroy [[Avengers|the Avengers]].\n\nShe later resurfaces as the superheroine\u00a0'''Meteorite''', helping the Avengers defeat\u00a0[[Growing Man]].\n\n=== Powers & Abilities ===\n* '''Superhuman Strength:''' She has shown sufficient strength, being able to easily overpower Black Widow & break through concrete structures.\n* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' She was able to carry on fighting with Black Widow, without tiring at all.\n* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Karla is capable of running and moving at speeds that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.\n* '''Superhuman Durability:''' She was able to take hits that would possibly kill a normal healthy human being, without any lingering effects.\n* '''Flight:''' She is also able to fly at high speeds & levitate as well.\n* '''Intangibility:''' She can mentally command her bodily photo-kinetic molecules to become intangible, so as to avoid physical damages.\n* '''Photokinesis:''' Her main ability is to generate & fire beams of photo-kinetic energy.\n* '''Superhuman Agility''': Karla's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.\n\n==Appearances==\nMoonstone joined the\u00a0Masters of Evil\u00a0alongside\u00a0Goliath,\u00a0Beetle, Fixer\u00a0and\u00a0Screaming Mimi\u00a0but after an initial defeat they are later contacted by\u00a0Baron Helmut Zemo\u00a0who teleported them to his base in\u00a0Brazil\u00a0where he plans to improve the Masters of Evil. They start by attacking\u00a0Avengers Tower while\u00a0Hawkeye\u00a0is the only one there during the time when the Avengers were handling a diversion at where the Masters of Evil were teleported to. Upon the Avengers returning, they help Hawkeye defeat the Masters of Evil. Baron Zemo escaped while the rest of the team was arrested.\n\nBaron Zemo disguised the team as the\u00a0Thunderbolts\u00a0taking one new identities becoming\u00a0Citizen V,MACH-IV,\u00a0Songbird,\u00a0Atlas, Meteorite, and\u00a0Techno. They have been the debut superhero team that has been doing some heroics where they had a woman named Gabby as their publicist. The Thunderbolts are first seen when they help the Avengers take down Growing Man. The press ends up giving the Thunderbolts the credit. Iron Man later tracked them to their headquarters and had a brief altercation with them until a bomb sent by Justin Hammer nearly wiped them out. When it comes to three possible bunkers of Justin Hammer, each members of both teams went to them and fought each Mandroid. It was through one of them that Iron Man and Citizen V found that the Thunderbolts' publicist Gabby has connections with Justin Hammer. At the latest bunker, the Avengers and the Thunderbolts fought Justin Hammer in his Mega-Mandroid which had force field abilities. Thanks to Moonstone phasing through, the Mega-Mandroid was defeated with Justin Hammer being handed over to the authorities. Citizen V took the opportunity to fire Gabby as Iron Man is believed to think that the Thunderbolts are good guys after all.\n\nUlysses Klaue\u00a0was in the middle of a Vibranium heist until he ends up fighting the Avengers and the Thunderbolts. While fleeing from them, Klaw runs into Citizen V who was the one who secretly hired him to steal the Vibranium. Upon being defeated, Citizen V places a device on Klaw's unconscious body and some on the Vibranium containers. Later on, the device goes off which merges Klaw with the Vibranium turning him into a Vibranium version of himself. It took the Avengers and the Thunderbolts to defeat him. Suspicious of the Thunderbolts, Hawkeye finds out that they were the Masters of Evil and gets detected. Luckily for him, the Avengers showed up resulting a fight between the two groups. After being saved from death by Hawkeye during the robbery, and seeing what it's like be a hero, Songbird convinces the rest of the team to turn on Zemo. Together, the Avengers and Thunderbolts expose Zemo as Citizen V which leads to Zemo combining with the energies of Klaw to become an energy monster. Thanks to a strategy from Captain America and Songbird, the Thunderbolts were able to defeat the energy monster. While also stating that they might not have seen the last of Baron Zemo, Captain America advises to the other Thunderbolts members that they should turn themselves in and that they will become official heroes when they get out.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMeteorite.jpg\nBaron Zemo AUR 17.png\nMoonstone AUR 1.png\nMoonstone AUR.png\nMoonstone AUR 2.png\nMoonstone AUR 3.png\nMoonstone AUR 4.png\nMaster of Evil AUR.png\nMoonstone AUR 5.png\nFixer and Meteorite AUR 2.png\nThunderbolts 01.png\nMoonstone Marvel XP.png|Moonstone in ''Marvel: Avengers Alliance''\nMeteorite AUR 2.png\nMeteorite AUR 9.png\nMeteorite AU 11.png\nMeteorite and Citizen V AUR.png\nMeteorite AUR 05.png\nMeteorite AUR 06.png\nMeteorite AUR 7.png\nMeteorite AUR 10.png\nMeteorite AU 12.png\nMeteorite AUR 14.png\nMeteorite AUR 6.png\nMeteorite AUR 19.png\nMeteorite AUR 15.png\nMach IV and Meteorite AUR.png\nMeteorite AUR 04.png\nThunderbolt 10.png\nMeteorite auR.png\nMeteorite AUR 08.png\nMeteorite and MACH IV AUR.png\nThunderbolt_14.png\nThunderbolt 3.png\nThunderbolt AUR 20.png\nThunderbolt_17.png\nSongbird 26.png\nThunderbolts (4).png\nFixer and Meteorite AUR.png\nHawkeye Meteorite AU.png\nThunderbolt 19.png\nThunderbolt AUR 19.png\nThunderbolt_16.png\nThunderbolt_AUR_11.png\nThunderbolt AUR 18.png\nThunderbolt AUR 17.png\nThunderbolt AUR 22.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
