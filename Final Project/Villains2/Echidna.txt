She is the \"Mother of All Monsters\" of every horrifying creature to appear in the series. She is also the wife of the monstrous [[Titan]], [[Typhon]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nShe is very motherly to her monstrous children. Echidna also is vicious and strict, attempting to destroy Athens with her entire family as Hades commands her to do so.\n\nShe cares for her children but is often tired and overworked.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nEchidna appears to be enormous with brown and green scales and a body of a dragon for a hindpart (much like the centaurs). She has horns, cat-like eyes, sharp teeth, and large, dragon-like wings. She also contains a stinger at the end of her tail and mane around her neck, similar to a lion.\n\n==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==\nIn the episode \"Hercules and the Big Games\" [[Hades]] visits Echidna and has her gather her entire family to attack Athens. Meanwhile, [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] is winning every event and enjoying being a hero (or sports hero, as [[Philoctetes|Phil]] calls it) \u2013 until [[Ares]] remembers, in a manner similar to anti-doping, that he is a demigod, and only mortals can compete; hence, half his points are taken off. But when Echidna and her family arrive, he puts aside popularity to save the day, with an assist from Ares and [[Athena]], who are working together for once.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hercules and the Return of Typhon]]\", Echidna, who was [[Typhon]]'s mate, seeks revenge wreaking havoc on Athens, so to prove himself to his father, Hercules challenges her, but in doing so, inadvertently releases Typhon. When [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] and Hercules reappeared, Typhon throttled his enemy and nearly succeeded when [[Hera]] once more intervened and threw a lightning bolt into his nostril, forcing all three monsters to flee.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hercules and the First Day of School]]\", to prove himself as a hero, Hercules challenges [[Orthos]] the Bi-Clops, who is the son of Echidna. When they brush him aside as a nobody, they go to [[Prometheus Academy]] instead, vying to eat Adonis.\n\nIn the episode \"Hercules and the Parents Weekend\" Hercules puts all other things aside when his parents \u2013 along with [[Adonis]]' and [[Cassandra (Hercules)|Cassandra]]'s parents are captured by Ladon, son of Echidna, for his dinner.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Echidna was cast with TV personality Kathie Lee Gifford. Typhon, Echidna's husband, was cast with Gifford's then-co-star Regis Philbin.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nechidna02.jpg\nHades-disney-villains-17399371-800-600.jpg\nEchidna03.jpg\nHydraBaby.JPG\nTyphon3.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Titans]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
