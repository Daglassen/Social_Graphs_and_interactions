The two male Party Favors have never been referred to by name, but the female one is named Evelyn, and has been known to work alongside her boss without the other two Party Favors.\n\nThe Bandit has also been harboring a crush on Dutch actress Viva Voom, even sending her cards every Valentine's Day. But since Viva is already in love with Governor Kevin, the feeling obviously isn't mutual. This rejection led to the Bandit changing his name to the '''Valentine Bandit''', and his Party Favors being called his '''Lonely Hearts'''. As the Valentine Bandit, he attempted to ruin Valentine's Day for the state and kidnapped Viva, but he was still unsuccessful in escaping capture by Teamo.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mark Hamill, the Birthday Bandit's voice actor, had also voiced [[w:c:batman:The Joker|The Joker]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and its spin-offs.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"209\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBirthdayBandit2.jpg\nBirthdayBandit3.jpg\nBirthdayBandit4.jpg\nCrandallConfrontBirthdayBandit.jpg\nBirthdayBandit5.jpg\nBirthdayBandit6.jpg\nBirthdayBandit7.jpg\nBirthdayBandit8.jpg\nBirthdayBandit9.jpg\nBirthdayBandit10.jpg\nBirthdayBandit11.jpg\nBirthdayBandit12.jpg\nBirthdayBandit13.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Birthday Bandit, The}}\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Clowns]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
