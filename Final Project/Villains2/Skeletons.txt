The skeletons are obviously undead walking \"creepers\" and have been long associated with the macabre side of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], though they are not actually malevolent in most of their appearances, resembling harmless outgoing pranksters.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Skeleton Dance]]''===\nThe Skeletons are the main protagonists of the short. The first one rises from behind a grave and scares away two cats and arranging itself into the classic skull and crossbones formation, before leaping into the center of the graveyard and being joined by three more. They proceed to dance and frolic in the graveyard, in general good-hearted dances and musical games, though they are somewhat reckless and unintentionally harmful in their behavior (A skeleton threw his skull at an owl in retaliation from being scared from its hooting and knocked off its feathers, they hurt a cat when attempting to use his whiskers like a violin, and one of them takes the femurs of another then using him as a xylophone until he collapses). When the rooster cries, the Skeletons panic (probably because, as in common ghost lore, they cannot stand sunlight) and merge into a single several-limbed creature that hides in a large tomb.\n\n===''[[The Haunted House (short)|The Haunted House]]''===\nWhen\u00a0[[Mickey Mouse]]\u00a0enters a haunted house, he is repeatedly scared by the Skeletons (who are more numerous than in their debut). He eventually comes across their leader, a hooded skeleton with a missing tooth (sometimes thought to be the\u00a0[[Grim Reaper]], though he isn't identified as such). Surprisingly, as he is cornered, Mickey is simply told to play the piano for them, and all the Skeletons begin dancing and frolicking in the haunted halls, much like in\u00a0''The Skeleton Dance''. Mickey, still scared, tries to escape the house, pursued by several Skeletons (and coming across more of them).\n\n===''[[The Mad Doctor]]''===\nThe [[The Mad Doctor (character)|Mad Doctor]]'s large castle is haunted by several Skeletons. Most of them are hiding in the furniture, including in the lift, cupboard, inside a stone pillar and inside the steps of a staircase (which are apparently really coffins). They attack Mickey, though whether they inhabit the Caslte and have decided to get rid of trespasser, or are doing so on the\u00a0[[The Mad Doctor (character)|Mad Doctor]]'s orders, is left unclear. A skeleton spider (an obvious nonsensicality, seeing how spiders are invertebrates, which could however be explained by the Spider being a creation of the Doctor's) also appears and attempts to eat Mickey.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe skeletons make cameo appearances in several episodes, including \"[[Dennis the Duck (House of Mouse)|Dennis the Duck]]\", \"[[House Ghosts]]\" and \"[[Halloween With Hades]]\". In'' Dennis the Duck'', they are among the black-and-white cartoon stars invited to the House for a special celebration along with\u00a0[[Dennis the Duck (character)|Dennis]]\u00a0himself. In\u00a0''House Ghosts'', they applauded after the [[Hansel and Gretel (Mickey Mouse Works short)|1st cartoon]] (the skeleton on the rightmost side spun his right arm with his left), and later help the ghosts of the\u00a0[[The Haunted Mansion (Disneyland)|Haunted Mansion]]\u00a0and the\u00a0[[Lonesome Ghosts]]\u00a0scare\u00a0[[Pete]]\u00a0during a\u00a0\"[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]\" song number.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===\nTwo skeletons make a cameo appearance in the episode \"[[Carried Away (Mickey Mouse)|Carried Away]]\" standing on the dock watching [[Mickey Mouse's Picnic|Mickey]] and [[Minnie]]'s boat pass by.\n\n===''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]''===\nThe skeletons make numerous cameos appearances in the episodes \"[[School of Fish]]\", \"[[The Big Good Wolf (The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse)|The Big Good Wolf]]\", and \"[[Houseghosts]].\"\n\n==Video game appearances==\n===''[[Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse]]''===\nThe skeletons are frequent enemies in the\u00a0\"Mad Doctor\" level, mirroring their inhabiting the Doctor's castle in the cartoon.\n\n===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===\nSome Skeletons are seen in the projector reel transition level based on the \"The Mad Doctor\" cartoon. Hidden-unseen skeletons eerily lift up the stairs that can make [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] fall down and another towards the end will throw a piece of brick at you and will cause you to lose some health. Some others appear in the second and third transition levels themed to \"[[The Haunted House]]\".\n\nIn [[Lonesome Manor]], Mickey confronts minions of the Mad Doctor who resemble\u00a0[[Bashers]]\u00a0but, instead of being those of pirates, their toon parts look like the skeletons. Since the skeletons were already the Mad Doctor's minions in his debut cartoon, it's possible he turned them into Bashers just like he did the pirates of [[Tortooga]].\n\n===''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''===\nThe skeletons appear in the two transition levels themed to the 1929 short that they debuted in. The original cartoon also appears on the game disc as an extra.\n\n== Trivia==\n\n*The hooded skeleton in\u00a0''The Haunted House'' was the only one of them to ever speak.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe skeleton dance 2large.jpg\nSkeletondance07.jpg\nSkeleton skull and crossbones.png\nThe skeleton dance 5large.jpg\n1929-danse-2.jpg\nAnnoyed skeleton.jpg\nThe skeleton dance 4large.jpg\nSkeletondance05.jpg\nThe skeleton dance 6large.jpg\nTumblr mcocjh3TsE1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nThe skeleton dance 7large.jpg\nTumblr mcoclk3bBZ1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n18010.jpg|The Skeletons in ''[[The Mad Doctor]]''\nTumblr mua0e2Yzoz1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr mc01zgh8IR1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nHh147.jpg\nHh146.jpg\nHh140.jpg\nHh138.jpg\nHh123.jpg\nHh120.jpg\nHh112.jpg\nHh99.jpg\nHh98.jpg\nHh72.jpg\nHh71.jpg\nHh66.jpg\nHoM Hades.jpg|The skeletons cameo in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Halloween With Hades]]\".\nHouse Of Mouse - (Ep. 49) - Halloween With Hades2.jpg\nHeart3.png\nPete dancing with the Skeletons.jpg|Pete joining the Skeleton Dance.\nKHIII - Classic Kingdom - The Mad Doctor.jpg|The skeletons in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''<nowiki/>'s Classic Kingdom.\nSkeleton Dance Projector 005.png|The Skeletons in ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''.\nCarriedAway2.jpeg|The skeletons cameo in ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Carried Away (Mickey Mouse)|Carried Away]]\".\nScreenshot 20201203-191001 Photos.jpg|One of the Skeletons in The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse Cameo in the episode \"School of Fish\"\nDHBM SKELETON DANCE.png|As a badge in [[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]\nDancing skeletons and floating musical instruments in mickey's house.jpg|The skeletons make a brief appearance in \"[[Houseghosts]]\", another episode of ''The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse''\nDSA-Silly Skeleton.png|Model In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\n</gallery>\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
