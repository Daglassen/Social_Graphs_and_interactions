Smudge has two main hobbies: uncontrollable sneezing and praising Crud, calling him respectful names like \"the master of mud\", \"the surveyor of slime\", \"the guru of garbage\" and \"the wiseman of waste\". Smudge has a special ability to slither around incredibly fast.\n\nWhen he finds [[Tigger]] and [[Christopher Robin]] under the bed, Smudge makes dusty circles around them. He then takes them to Crud and presents them to him. Smudge is incredibly loyal to Crud and is willing to do anything he's told to do. If he were to speak out of turn, Crud would likely spill some of his own slimy filth on him to shut him up. Instead of taking offense, Smudge is grateful and takes it tolerantly. When Christopher Robin overcomes Crud and sucks him up in Crud's reverse vacuum cleaner, he calls for Smudge, resulting in both going to their fate.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
