Muava is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Muava is an elderly Gerudo who can be found sitting by the small Goddess Statue in Gerudo Town. To Link's surprise, Muava immediately notices that Link is a man when he speaks to her. Muava says that he might be able to fool everyone else, but not her. Muava does not care that Link has snuck into Gerudo Town and asks him to stay and chat with her. If Link asks about the nearby Goddess Statue, Muava tells him that the Statue has been there long before she was born. She explains that nobody comes there anymore because they do not "believe in that stuff anymore," comparing it to how people avoid her now as well. Muava says that someone has to keep the Goddess Statue company. If Link asks Muava if she has ever left Gerudo Town, Muava explains that she was once a beautiful traveler when she was young and claims that men almost always noticed her enter a room. Muava recalls when she traveled across Hyrule in search of Lover's Pond to meet her true love, but never found it. Muava then says that before she knew it, she was old and men no longer paid attention to her. She snaps at Link to stop looking so sad and assures him that it was a long time ago. Muava enjoys talking to Link, commenting that it is a treat to chat with a man again. Before Link ends the conversation, Muava advises him to live his life to the fullest.
