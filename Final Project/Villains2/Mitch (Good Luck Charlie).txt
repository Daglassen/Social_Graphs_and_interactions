He is the manager of the\u00a0Kwikki Chikki\u00a0in Southwest Denver. Mitch is also [[PJ Duncan|PJ]]'s boss. He is unfair and treated [[Teddy Duncan|Teddy]] very well for her short time there, unlike how he treats PJ.\n==History==\nMitch is a non-caring person. He does not care about his workers. He just has wants and needs. He also doesn't care to tell people about what is in the\u00a0Kwikki Chikki\u00a0food. The food is not always chicken even if the menu says so. He is also unfair. He used to pay the minimum wage workers below the minimum wage. Because of this, they demanded for more money in a strike. Recently, he just hired new workers. \"Corporal S. Kwikki\" forced him to rehire the employees so PJ, Justin, and Jordan could get their jobs back. He usually call PJ \"J.P.\", similar to how Chef calls him \"Potty,\" rather than \"Patty\" (referring to his first name).\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Good Luck Charlie}}\n[[Category:Good Luck Charlie characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
