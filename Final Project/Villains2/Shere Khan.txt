A powerful Bengal tiger, Shere Khan is considered suave and charming, yet is deeply feared as the most ferocious predator in the jungle. His reputation was such that he needed only to show himself to intimidate his victims. Khan is equally notorious for his animosity toward man, due to his fear of guns and fire. As such, he has vowed to kill any human that steps foot in the jungle.\n\n==Background==\nAs a cub, Shere Khan was best friends with [[Baloo]], [[Bagheera]], [[King Louie|Louie]], [[Colonel Hathi|Hathi]], and [[Kaa]]. However, he was egotistical and cocky which sometimes led to situations where his friends had to bail him out. Nonetheless, he was fond of his friends and was often protective of them when there was danger. In many episodes he even saved their lives. He was also quite affectionate and loving toward his old grandmother. However, as a predator, Khan acted tough as he thought the other animals wouldn't respect him if he showed his soft side. He and his friends went on many adventures together but, at some undetermined point in time, Shere Khan became vicious and belligerent, feared by all the inhabitants of the jungle. He lost the esteem of his friends and they regarded him with distrust from that moment forward. \n\nDespite this, in the DVD scenes of Jungle Cubs: Born to be Wild, Baloo, now an adult, says that, while Khan would \"first eat and then ask questions\", he doesn't do it out of malice. This implies that, like any other predator, Khan's ways of hunting are merely to survive.\n\n===Personality===\n{{Quote|Oh, please don't insult my intelligence. It makes me irritable.|Shere Khan to Kaa}}\nShere Khan, as a tiger, is the physical embodiment of power and composes himself with grace. Carrying himself with a dignified manner and possessing a strong sense of regal pride and elegance, the ruthless tiger is viewed as the uncorroborated lord of the jungles of India. He is well aware of this reputation and asserts it with sadistic pleasure to the best advantage. Most, if not all, residents of the jungle fear Shere Khan, and for reasons apparent: he is physically imposing and arguably the strongest predator in the jungle; his charm and stoic expressions bely an unpredictable and ferocious nature with a hair-trigger temper; and his sharp teeth and claws are unmatched in battle. He speaks rather politely, even to potential victims, with a soft tone, though he interjects with subtly condescending comments. He also seems fond of taunting and emotionally taunting his prey until he's ready to make the killing strike.\n\nThere is no creature Shere Khan holds a deeper burning hatred and resentment for than mankind. It is strongly implied that Shere Khan sees humans as unforgiving, soulless creatures who continuously cause havoc on nature, using narcissistic entitlement as justification for such acts.<ref>[[Run (song)|\"Run\", a song from ''The Jungle Book: Rhythm N'Groove'']]</ref> According to Bagheera, Khan \"hates man with a vengeance...because he fears man's gun and man's fire\"; these two weapons being the only things capable of challenging Khan's authority and power. His fear of fire is the most dominant; a crippling phobia capable of driving the tiger to immediate panic. As such, Shere Khan has vowed to kill any human that steps foot within the jungle. His rage is such that he is devoted to killing [[Mowgli]], and any creature willing to protect him, to prevent the man-cub from growing up to wield the weapons he fears. \n\nIn ''The Jungle Book 2'', Shere Khan's personality and aura take a somewhat darker turn, no doubt a result of his humiliating defeat at the hands of Mowgli. In contrast to the first film, his polite mannerisms and calm monologues are a rarity. His bitterness and hatred for Mowgli have removed any patience or refinement. He is quick to action with no mood for distractions or foolishness and behaves in a more feral way, constantly growling, roaring, and lashing out at anything that pesters him, including a jokester [[Lucky (The Jungle Book)|vulture]] as punishment for mocking him.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Jungle Book]]''===\n{{Quote |He hates man with a vengeance, you know that! Because he fears Man's gun and Man's fire.|Bagheera to Baloo}}[[File:Junglebook526.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shere Khan in the original film.]]\n\nShere Khan makes his first physical appearance two-thirds of the way through the film, seen stalking a deer as prey. His hunt is ruined when [[Colonel Hathi]] comes marching by with his [[Jungle Patrol|herd]], scaring the deer away, much to Shere Khan's annoyance. When Bagheera halts the herd, Shere Khan eavesdrops on their conversation and is delighted to hear about Mowgli the man-cub who had recently run away from Bagheera with the hopes of staying in the jungle. Bagheera implores Hathi to help find the boy who is alone and devoid of protection. Hathi begrudgingly agrees and, once the herd and Bagheera go their separate ways, Khan begins his own hunt for Mowgli.\n\nAfter searching for some time, he hears [[Kaa]] singing out of sight in a tree. Suspicious, he yanks Kaa's tail like a doorbell and invites the python to speak. Khan questions whether Kaa has any company and asks him about the lost man-cub, encouraged by the snake's shifty behavior and his singing. Kaa attempted to hypnotize Khan, to no avail, who said he had \"no time for that sort of nonsense\". Seemingly satisfied after searching some of Kaa's coils, Khan ordered him to act as an informant should he come across the man-cub. Kaa agreed, and Khan took his leave, unaware that Mowgli was sleeping in Kaa's long coils in the tree - though the man-cub soon escaped.\n\nShere Khan's travels eventually lead to the wastelands where he overhears a quartet of [[Buzzie, Flaps, Ziggy, and Dizzy|vultures]] singing. He investigates and finds Mowgli dancing with the birds, even going so far as to finishing the last lines of the song with an imposing baritone voice. He applauds the performance and thanks the vultures for \"detaining [his] victim\" before frightening them away with minimal effort. However, Mowgli is unperturbed and refuses to show fear or run. Impressed by the boy's spirit, Shere Khan decides to give him a head start to make the chase more interesting for him. As Khan counts to ten, Mowgli instead rushes to find a stick to defend himself with. Irritated by this show of courage, Khan speeds up the countdown before launching at Mowgli but is held back by Baloo who grabs his tail.  As Shere Khan runs in circles, struggling to break free of Baloo's grip, the vultures carry Mowgli to safety until they are startled by a lightning flash that ignites a nearby dead tree.\n\nKnowing fire is the one thing Khan fears, the vultures encourage Mowgli to grab a burning branch. Shere Khan furiously bites and hits Baloo until the bear falls unconscious, only to be surrounded by the nagging vultures. While he's distracted, Mowgli ties Khan's tail to the burning branch. Terrified and hysterical, Khan frantically tries to put the fire out, to no avail. He runs away, humiliated, scared and burned.\n\n===''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''===\n[[File:Junglebook2 233.jpg|thumb|250px|Shere Khan in ''The Jungle Book 2'' after Lucky teases him.]]\nShere Khan returned once again as the main antagonist in the second film. Unlike in the first, he appeared much earlier and he looks far more evil and antagonistic than before, much less calm and controlled than in the previous film. He is first seen smashing a makeshift version of Mowgli's head after [[Baloo]] left the area with [[Bagheera]] in pursuit. He seeks revenge on Mowgli for humiliating him at the climax of the original film and wishes for nothing more than his death. Khan travels to the Man-Village where Mowgli dwells.\n\nHe had no luck until he heard [[Shanti]], one of Mowgli's friends, calling him. He then found Mowgli's house and was delighted that he would now have his chance for revenge. He became impatient when Mowgli didn't appear. All at once, Mowgli appeared in the air above the house. After Shanti started screaming about a wild animal, Khan noticed it was Baloo with Mowgli and was surprised. After the villagers responded to Shanti's calls, they saw Shere Khan instead of Baloo and chased him out of the village. Khan was attacked by the villagers with torches but they had no power over him. He escaped in rage but overjoyed to hear that Mowgli is now in the jungle. He encountered [[Kaa]] afterward, who had seen Mowgli. Kaa at first insisted he didn't know where Mowgli was, but Shere Khan knew better and intimidated him, even though Kaa was telling the truth.\n\nOut of fear, Kaa told Khan to search by the swamp. However, when Khan arrived, Mowgli is nowhere to be found and he splashes the water in fury as he says \"That snake lied to me!\" The vultures return and become uneasy when their newest member [[Lucky (The Jungle Book)|Lucky]] begins to insanely mock him. After a few \"jokes\", Shere Khan tricks Lucky into revealing Mowgli's whereabouts. Before Khan leaves, he viciously mauls Lucky as revenge for the annoyance and presumably kills him. Later on, he found [[Shanti]] and [[Ranjan]] and cornered them. Mowgli then appeared to find them and Khan confronted him.\n\nMowgli ran away and Khan pursued him to a temple in the middle of a pool of lava. After Baloo and Shanti teamed up and started to bang gongs with Mowgli, one fell down revealing Shanti. He then said he would kill her if Mowgli wouldn't come out. Mowgli did and he pursued him and Shanti after knocking Baloo aside. Mowgli and Shanti jumped onto a tiger statue right over a pit of lava with Shere Khan right behind them. Before he could kill them, the statue's head fell off towards the lava. Baloo saved Mowgli and Shanti, while Khan fell into the pit. Rather than perishing, he landed on a slab of rock and was trapped underneath the statue's head. Lucky, still alive but lost the feathers on his body and has a bruised right eye, then flew down and started to tease Khan again, much to his annoyance.\n\n===''[[TaleSpin]]''===\n[[File:Talespinpic2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shere Khan as he appears in ''TaleSpin''.]]\nShere Khan appears in a more anthropomorphic form in the television series ''TaleSpin''. [[Tony Jay]] provides his thick, British-accented voice starting from the beginning of the series, through other appearances, until his death.\n\nKhan is an extremely wealthy CEO who is the dominant economic force in [[Cape Suzette]], and an anti-hero. He is depicted as a selfish business man. He is sometimes accompanied by [[Raja|an unnamed emaciated tiger \"yes-man\" office aide]]. He takes enjoyment out of running small companies out of business ([[Higher For Hire]] is sometimes on his hit list) with a sense of ruthlessness to skirt around the law as he chooses. He also likes to feed tiny insects to the many carnivorous plants he grows in his office. At one point he even hires the [[Air Pirates]] to create an artificial oil shortage, so he can extort higher prices from the public in \"[[On a Wing and a Bear]]\".\n\nHe has a well-armed air force and navy, complete with battleships. This is mainly to protect his [[Khan Transport]] shipping and business interests worldwide. However, he is willing to act nobly at times, such as ordering his forces into the air to protect the city from the Air Pirates, and has shown that he respects [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]]'s piloting skills, most notably when he allows Baloo to take over piloting his plane after having [[Khan's Pilots|all of his pilots]] replaced with his own robotic pilots; his plane is ambushed by the Air Pirates, and the robotic pilot refuses to deviate from its flight plan due to its programming, causing Baloo to forcefully remove the robot and take control of the plane to evade the foes.\n\nHe has an extremely cool and calm personality, rarely (if ever) showing any sort of alarm or surprise, regardless of the circumstances. In fact, when his plane is attacked by [[Don Karnage]]'s forces in the incident detailed above, he calmly mixes himself a drink as he explains the situation to Baloo.\n\nThis version of Shere Khan also makes a cameo in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' series in the episode \"[[Of Mice and Menace]]\". He appears in a couple of mugshots on a computer, implying that he is a criminal in the series.\n\nThis version of Shere Khan also serves as the influence for CEO Carl, the main antagonist of the CG animated TV series ''Talking Tom and Friends''.\n\n===''[[Jungle Cubs]]''===\n[[File:Shere Khan Jungle Cubs.png|thumb|250px|Shere Khan as a cub in ''Jungle Cubs''.]]\nShere Khan appeared as a young cub in the animated series ''Jungle Cubs'', voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. In the series, it was shown that Shere Khan was friends with [[Baloo]], [[Bagheera]], [[Colonel Hathi|Hathi]], [[King Louie|Louie]], and [[Kaa]] during childhood. Shere Khan was more of a bully and cocky in the series rather than a dangerous predator. Khan often tagged along with Baloo and friends on many adventures, usually trying to prove he's braver than they are. In the series, Shere Khan is given an American accent, while in other appearances, Khan speaks with a British accent. He seems to be the oldest of the cubs. He is sometimes called '''Khanny''' by others.\n\nIn spite of being a cub, Khan still holds his intimidating demeanor and continues to strike fear into the hearts of many of the jungle's inhabitants. However, his cocky attitude can get him and his friends into trouble with foes even he's frightened by, usually by bigger animals. Khan prefers to refer to the others as his followers rather than his friends, even though he obviously enjoys spending time with them. During the second season though, while still friends with the other cubs, he becomes less often seen with them and spends more time hunting. Much like an adult, Khan was sometimes found with [[Kaa]]. In one episode, the duo teamed up to take advantage of [[King Louie|Louie]], after he accidentally injured them. Acting as if they were too injured to do anything themselves, they spent the day bossing the ape around.\n\nKhan is the least physically-changed of the cubs during the second season: He is slightly taller with brighter fur, but still has the same voice actor.\n\nIn ''Jungle Cubs: Born to Be Wild'' DVD, Khan, as an adult, returned to murder Mowgli yet again; however, Baloo was able to throw a beehive onto the tiger's head right before he could, having him run off in pain.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:ShereKhan HouseofMouse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shere Khan in ''House of Mouse''.]]\nShere Khan appeared in the TV series ''House of Mouse'' as a recurring guest, usually seen sitting either alone or with Kaa. In most of his pairings with Kaa, he is often seen holding Kaa by the neck, like in the movie.\n\nIn his most notable appearance in \"[[The Mouse Who Came to Dinner]]\", [[Mortimer Mouse]] was pretending to be the club's critic (which was really [[Lumiere]]) to have Mickey and friends obey him, annoying them and the other guests including Shere Khan. When Mortimer demanded real entertainment (instead of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]), Shere Khan agreed with Lumiere (who stated that the entertainment is excellent) that Mortimer was the one who was annoying and asked \"Do you mind?\" to which Mortimer replied, \"Yeah, as a matter of fact, I ''do'' mind, Stripey! Somebody get [[Tigger]]'s evil twin here a ball of yarn!\" Later, when it's revealed Mortimer is the star of the \"celebrity roast\", Shere Khan comments \"How delightful,\" causing Mortimer to retort, \"Oh be quiet, Mr. Cat Food!\"\n\nA dish called Shere Khan's Flan, named after the villainous tiger, is mentioned by Goofy in \"[[Rent Day]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Dining Goofy]]\", Shere Khan and Kaa were accidentally given broccoli by Goofy. He used one of his claws on Goofy to make it clear that he (and Kaa) was not a vegetarian. Soon after Goofy was replaced by advanced technology, Shere Khan and Kaa's meal order was corrected and they both got a giant steak to eat.\n\nIn \"[[Goofy's Menu Magic]]\", when a food shortage occurred, Goofy attempted to serve Shere Khan his shoe for dinner (an apparent reference to the Goofy short \"[[Tiger Trouble]]\"). Shere Khan, however, was unamused.\n\nIn \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\", Shere Khan appears with Kaa during \"[[The Ludwig Von Drake Song]]\".\n\nDespite appearing in the series itself, Shere Khan never appeared in its movie ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', as Kaa is the only villain from ''The Jungle Book'' to join the Disney Villains, led by [[Jafar]] to take over the House of Mouse. However, in the opening sequence, a tiger's paw is seen on-screen as the characters are walking towards the club. So it could be possible that only Shere Khan's paw was seen once in the movie.\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n\n===''[[Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book]]''===\n{{Quote|Do not be wishing for this tiger, Sahib. He's the Devil!|Buldeo to Boone.}}\n[[File:Real Shere Khan.jpg|thumb|250px|Shere Khan in ''Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book''.]]\nShere Khan also appears in the [[1994]] live-action film, being portrayed by a real tiger. However, Shere Khan is presented as a more sympathetic character in this film. Khan appears rarely and instead serves as a major antagonist turned anti-hero of the film while an arrogant British captain named [[William Boone]] (played by [[Cary Elwes]]) serves as the main antagonist of the film. Unlike his animated counterpart, Khan does not kill for sport, and his sole goal is to protect the jungle from those who break its \"laws\", namely humans who kill animals for fun instead of food. He is described by [[Colonel Geoffrey Brydon|the narrator]] of the film as \"the jungle's royal keeper\", and by [[Buldeo (Jungle Book 1994)|Buldeo]] as the \"king of tigers\".\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, he sees two British guards and a hunter named Buldeo shooting animals for fun, and becomes enraged at this. He roars in his fury, letting the soldiers know he's returned and proceeds to follow the column of soldiers that the guards and Buldeo are part of. That night, he attacks the humans' camp in revenge for the animals' death, killing the two guards before turning on Buldeo. But before Khan can kill Buldeo, [[Nathoo]] (Mowgli's father and the soldiers' guide) shields the hunter. Although Nathoo tells Buldeo to shoot Khan, the ungrateful hunter runs away and abandons Mowgli's father to be killed. Khan's attack is also what led [[Mowgli]] to being separated from civilization and living in the jungle. Although he was heard growling when Bagheera found Mowgli, the tiger made no attempts to attack Mowgli at any point over the years (probably because Mowgli hasn't broken the jungle law).\n\nShere Khan is not seen again until the second half of the movie. By this time, Mowgli has fallen in love with his childhood friend [[Katherine \"Kitty\" Brydon]] and made an enemy in Captain Boone, who has his henchmen kidnap Kitty and her father to force Mowgli to take them to a treasure. Like before, Khan roars to announce his return, though why he started stalking the group is not revealed (it was possible to avenge Baloo's earlier shooting by Boone and Wilkins). Boone plans to kill Shere Khan for his skin, though Buldeo tries to convince him otherwise, knowing how dangerous the tiger is. Two of Boone's henchmen die before Khan catches up to the group, where he scares the villains into splitting up. Once separated, Shere Khan kills [[Lt. John Wilkins]], a henchman of Captain Boone, while Buldeo is buried alive while trying to shoot Mowgli.\n\nAfter the climactic battle between Mowgli and Boone (ending with Boone being killed by Kaa), Khan and Mowgli meet face to face for the first time. Khan is obviously distrusting of Mowgli (and all humans in general) and attempts to scare him away by roaring in his face, but Mowgli stubbornly roars back and stares Khan down. Seeing Mowgli's courage, Khan develops a newfound respect for him, and begins to see him as a fellow \"creature of the jungle\". Because of this and the fact that neither broke the jungle law, Shere Khan spares Mowgli and allows him and Kitty to leave peacefully.\n\n===''[[The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story]]''===\nShere Khan is first seen attending the jungle meeting called by Hathi. He then contemplates on who he is going to eat, with his sidekick, Tabaqui, the hyena, telling jokes about it, much to the tiger's annoyance. He then decides to hunt man, claiming to have a craving for \"Indian food\". He and Tabaqui then ambush some humans visiting the river, but when he is shot at by hunters, he flees and is assumed dead. Years later, he reveals himself alive to the wolf pack and demands that Mowgli is given to him, but Akela refuses, and Shere Khan swears revenge. He is later seen conspiring with the wolf pack bullies about separating Mowgli from the pack, which succeeds. He and Tabaqui then conspire with the chimps about separating Mowgli from Bagheera and Baloo.\n\nThe chimps then inform Shere Khan that they've succeeded in capturing Mowgli, and he and Tabaqui head there. En route, Shere Khan runs into Raksha and kills her. By the time Shere Khan arrives in Monkey Town, Mowgli had escaped with help from Baloo and Bagheera. The enraged tiger then attacks the chimps. Whether or not he killed them is unknown.\n\nLater, Mowgli lures Shere Khan into a trap by having him chase him to the river. Shere Khan at first scoffs at the notion that Mowgli can defeat him, but Mowgli forms a circle of fire around the tiger, frightening him and causing Tabaqui to desert him. Mowgli then makes Shere Khan to swear that he will leave the jungle and never return, threatening him should he break his word. The frightened tiger agrees, and flees the jungle forever.\n\n===[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|''The Jungle Book'' (2016)]]===\n[[File:Jungle Book 2016 90.png|thumb|left|250px|Shere Khan in the 2016 film.]]\nShere Khan appears in the [[2016]] live-action film adaptation, voiced by [[Idris Elba]]. He is also the main antagonist in that adaptation. In this incarnation, Shere Khan sports burn scars and a blind eye on the left side of his face sustained from a fight with Mowgli's father. Idris Elba described this incarnation of Shere Khan as \"a creature that reigns with fear\" and that he \"terrorizes everyone he encounters because he comes from a place of fear\".\n\nShere Khan first appears during the drought, when the animals gather to drink at the Water Truce; the watering hole at which all animals drink without attacking each other, although the presence of tiger frightens them. When Shere Khan smells Mowgli, he is confronted by the Seeonee wolf pack led by Akela, who states that Mowgli belongs to their pack. Shere Khan mockingly scoffs at this and wonders when man was allowed to be adopted into the jungle. When Akela defends Mowgli, Shere Khan shows the scarred side of his face to remind the animals at the Water Truce of what a grown man is capable of. He then says that the law of the jungle states that man is forbidden. Raksha, however, retorts that Shere Khan also commits deeds forbidden in the jungle, stating that he hunts for pleasure and kills for power, and firmly states that Mowgli is her cub. Shere Khan, respecting the sanctity of the Water Truce, gives them until the monsoon season to hand Mowgli over before leaving. This causes Akela and his wolf pack to debate whether to have Mowgli leave the jungle or not, resulting Mowgli to leave the wolf pack with Bagheera to head over to a near-by Man-village.\n\nShere Khan next appears when Bagheera is escorting Mowgli to the Man-village. He stalks them through a herd of Buffalo and attacks Mowgli, only to be attacked by Bagheera. They fight viciously, but Shere Khan easily overpowers and injures Bagheera. He then chases after Mowgli through the stampeding buffalo, but Mowgli outruns him, escaping with the herd, much to Shere Khan's fury.\n\nShere Khan returns to the Seeonee pack and discusses Mowgli with Akela, who states that Mowgli has left the jungle, meaning that the pack and the tiger no longer have a quarrel. However, a furious Shere Khan kills Akela by throwing him off a cliff before instating himself as the pack's alpha. He then tells the wolves to spread the word of Akela's death, hoping it will lure Mowgli to him.\n\nDuring her encounter with Mowgli, Kaa reveals that Mowgli and his father were traveling from one village to another when Shere Khan encountered them. Shere Khan killed Mowgli's father but ran away after being burned by his torch, leaving Mowgli to be adopted by Bagheera and the wolf pack.\n\nWhile reigning as the pack's leader, Shere Khan tells stories to the wolf pups about the other creatures of the jungle (in particular, the cuckoo, which preys upon the love of the other mother birds in order to deposit its own egg into their nest, starving them while benefiting its own chick). He directs his story at Raksha, citing her love for Mowgli as a sign of weakness. When Raksha asked why Shere Khan is doing this, he states that he wants Mowgli dead and that he'll be waiting when Mowgli returns. When King Louie informs Mowgli of Akela's death, he returns with a torch stolen from the Man-village and accidentally starts a forest fire.\n\n[[File:Jungle-book-2016-disneyscreencaps.com-10715.jpg|thumb|250px|Shere Khan falls to his death in the fire.]]\nMowgli faces Shere Khan at the Water Truce, where the tiger shows the boy has become a man in his use of fire, and that all the other animals now fear him because of it. Mowgli then throws the fire away, allowing Shere Khan to attack him, only to be confronted by Baloo, Bagheera, and Raksha and her pack, who cite their code as they defy him. Shere Khan attacks regardless, saying he will have them all in his teeth, and fights Baloo, the wolves, and Bagheera, who give Mowgli enough time to run to the burning jungle. Shere Khan pursues him to an old strangler fig tree, and chases him into it, not knowing he has been lured into a trap. As he faces Mowgli, he mocks the boy, saying that he never would allow him to grow old and that he will kill him as he killed Mowgli's father and Akela, mockingly asking how much longer the man-cub thought he would last against him than they did. Mowgli replies that he is not afraid of Shere Khan and is done running from the tiger, goading him into pouncing before swinging away to safety. However, the branch Mowgli was standing on is too weak to hold Shere Khan's weight and it breaks off, sending the tiger plummeting to his death in a fiery pit below the tree, and with this, both Mowgli's father and Akela are avenged.\n\n==Printed media==\n===''Descendants: Isle of the Lost''===\nShere Khan is among the villains imprisoned on the [[Isle of the Lost]]. Apparently, he had a soft spot for [[Evie]] when she was younger, since every time she giggles he smiles.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[The Jungle Book (video game)|The Jungle Book]]''===\nShere Khan appeared as the final boss in the Virgin Studios [[The Jungle Book (video game)|video game adaptation]] of ''The Jungle Book''.

As the game follows the storyline of the original film, Shere Khan's goal is the same as the film. However, Khan appears much earlier in the game.

During the storyline, Khan arrives in the Kingdom in search of Mowgli, but is fended off by Bagheera. Mowgli then decides to take on Khan, himself, but is aided by Baloo, Bagheera and King Louie. Once Khan gets fire to his tail, he flees the kingdom in fear.\n\n===Other games===\nShere Khan is featured as a boss in ''[[QuackShot]]'', battling [[Donald Duck]]. He attacks by roaring fire from his mouth.\n\nFor ''[[Disney Universe]]'', a Shere Khan costume is available to buy on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for ''The Jungle Book'' costume pack.\n\nA Shere Khan Costume appeared in Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, each half (top and bottom) being purchaseable in the in-game shop for 11,000 Kudos each from September 7th to September 9th, 2021\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Shere Khan Flights of Fantasy Parade.jpg|thumb|250px|Shere Khan in the Flights of Fantasy parade.]]\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nAt [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], Shere Khan played the role as the main antagonist in [[Journey into the Jungle Book]] and preys upon Mowgli trying to do away with him as he did in the film.\n\nIn the \"Friendship\" segment of [[Happily Ever After (fireworks show)|Happily Ever After]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]], the balcony of Cinderella Castle sang the last bit of \"[[That's What Friends are For]]\" in his deep voice.\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nDuring the [[2015]] Halloween celebration, Shere Khan's likeness was featured alongside other Disney villains at the parks.\n\n===[[Disneyland Paris]]===\nIn France, Shere Khan can be seen poking his head out of the tree in the parade's jungle-themed float for [[Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade]].\n\n===[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]===\nIn Hong Kong Disneyland's [[Flights of Fantasy Parade]], Shere Khan makes an appearance at the very top of the jungle float.\n\nHe also appeared as one of [[Maleficent]]'s invited guests during the finale of ''[[Villains Night Out!]]'', and made an appearance during the final scene of ''[[The Nightmare Experiment]]''.\n\n==Differences from the source material==\n*In the original stories, Shere Khan is nicknamed \"The Lame One\" and has a crippled leg, but in the films, he has no lameness.\n*In the original stories, Shere Khan was hardly a physical threat since all the other predators in the jungle were able to intimidate him because of his lameness. Nevertheless, Shere Khan was a threat to Mowgli as he was manipulative and poisoned the wolf pack against him. He even successfully managed to convince the pack that Akela was no longer worthy of leading the pack (which would allow Shere Khan to legally kill Akela and demand Mowgli's life). The 1967 Disney version of Shere Khan is the opposite. Rather than being an intellectual, he is ruthless and a physical powerhouse. The 2016 Disney version of Shere Khan is a combination of all three; he is intelligent, cunning and manipulative like in the books, ruthless, and strong enough to fight Baloo, Bagheera and the wolf pack all at once and defeat them, only losing to Mowgli because Mowgli goaded him into a trap.\n*In the book, Shere Khan is assisted by his sidekick Tabaqui, the jackal. In the early drafts of Disney's ''The Jungle Book'', Tabaqui was meant to appear as a secondary villain. But director Wolfgang Reitherman did not want another canine villain so soon after ''The Sword in the Stone''.\n*In the book, Shere Khan is eventually killed by a buffalo stampede organized by Mowgli and Grey Brother. Mowgli then skins the tiger and brings the skin to Akela, ending his exile from the pack. In the Disney version, Mowgli uses fire to scare Shere Khan away, ruining the tiger's reputation in the jungle. A buffalo stampede occurs in the 2016 film, similar to the novel, but does not kill the tiger, instead preventing him from killing Mowgli.\n*In the book, Shere Khan was aware of Mowgli's presence in the jungle from the very beginning and it is implied that he killed his birth parents (though Kipling left this to interpretation) and he was tracking down Mowgli when he made his way to the wolf den. Since then, Shere Khan had been trying to manipulate the wolves into giving up Mowgli. Whereas in the Disney version, Shere Khan was completely unaware that Mowgli had been living in the jungle for 10 years until he overhears a conversation between Bagheera and Hathi. In the 2016 version, Shere Khan is the reason Mowgli is orphaned in the jungle; he personally kills Mowgli's father when they were traveling between villages and had stopped in a cave for the night. Shere Khan was burned in the attempt to kill them both, and remembers the boy from the incident.\n*The book Shere Khan has different motives than the Disney version. In the book, Shere Khan holds no grudge against humans more than any other animal despite being afraid of what man is capable. His reason to kill Mowgli had more to do with pride than anything as he believes Mowgli to be his rightful kill and that he has been disgraced when he was denied his prey. Whereas Disney's Shere Khan wants to kill Mowgli because he is a primary target for human hunters and does not want to risk Mowgli to grow up to become one of them. In the 2016 version, Shere Khan's motives are much the same, but with the added motive of wanting to prove to the jungle's creatures that Mowgli is as destructive and dangerous as any other human and wanting to eat him in revenge for Mowgli's father burning him.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The word ''Shere'' (or \"shir\") translates as \"tiger\" or \"lion\" in Persian, Hindi, and Punjabi. While ''Khan'' translates as \"sovereign\", \"king\", or \"military leader\" and so forth in a number of languages influenced by the Mongols, including Pashto. In other words, Khan's name means \"Tiger King\" or \"King of the Tigers\".\n*According to this [https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mnpjz36G7No/V4wE7eixjuI/AAAAAAAARfw/N5RgG9D9hhwT1rxosOuRJJY99w91nFMkwCLcB/s1600/SKV2c.png list] posted by [[Andreas Deja]] on his blog, [[Don Adams]], Herschel Bernardi, Neville Brand, John Carradine, Ted Cassidy, William Conrad, [[Hans Conried]], [[John Dehner]], Richard Devon, Gale Gordon, Clu Gulager, [[Jonathan Harris]], Victor Jory, Boris Karloff, Sheldon Leonard, George Macready, John McGiver, Robert Middleton, [[Vincent Price]], Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone, [[Don Rickles]], Edward G. Robinson, Paul Stewart, Larry Storch, and Carlton Young were all considered for the role of Shere Khan before George Sanders was chosen.\n*The Hebrew dub of both the 1967 film and its [[The Jungle Book 2|sequel]] incorrectly identifies Shere Khan as a leopard.\n*Shere Khan seems to be the only character who is resistant to Kaa's hypnosis, as when Kaa attempted to do so with Shere Khan in the first film like he had with Mowgli and Bagheera, Khan simply ignored him.\n*In some versions, the tiger's name is spelled \"Shere Kahn\".\n*In the original draft of the 1967 film, Shere Khan was originally going to die when Mowgli shot him in the head with a shotgun that belonged to a greedy hunter named Buldeo, whom Khan himself had just killed. It was cut when Disney realized it would be too scary. However, he does die in the 2016 film, albeit at the hands of fire.\n*According to songwriter Richard M. Sherman, [[Bill Lee]] of ''The Mellomen'' sings Shere Khan's part in \"[[That's What Friends are For]]\", due to [[George Sanders]] not being available. According to the liner notes in [[The Jungle Book (soundtrack)|''The Jungle Book'' soundtrack]], fellow Mellomen member [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] provides the singing for Shere Khan, not Bill Lee.\n*Shere Khan is a {{WikipediaLink|Bengal tiger}} and they have been known to prey on bears, so it actually makes sense for Baloo to be one of his enemies, and Baloo to be visibly afraid of him.\n**It also makes sense for Bagheera to be Shere Khan's enemy, as real tigers and panthers are natural enemies and competitors. They will kill each other's cubs and steal food from one another when they have an opportunity.\n*Animator Milt Kahl used the films: ''[[Jungle Cat]]'' and ''[[A Tiger Walks]]'' as references for the way Shere Khan walks.\n*Shere Khan's defined chin is actually based on [[George Sanders]]'s own.\n**Shere Khan's chin in turn was the inspiration for the lantern jaw for the [[wikipedia:Zilla (Godzilla)|1998 version of Godzilla]] (currently known as Zilla).\n**Also, George Sanders' performance as Shere Khan was cited to be the inspiration for Richard Waugh's voice for [[w:c:ResidentEvil:Albert Wesker|Albert Wesker]] in the ''[[w:c:ResidentEvil:Resident Evil|Resident Evil]]'' series.<ref>http://projectumbrella.net/articles/Richard-Waugh-Interview-Project-Umbrella</ref>\n*Contrary to popular belief, Shere Khan did not serve as an inspiration for [[Scar]] in ''[[The Lion King]] ''as his lead animator and designer Andreas Deja avoided watching ''The Jungle Book'' exactly because he did not want Scar to end up ''too'' similar to Shere Khan.\n**Coincidentally, the way Shere Khan was depicted in the books in terms of personality was more similar to Scar than Disney's Shere Khan. Like Scar, the original Shere Khan was not much of a physical threat but was rather cunning and manipulative.\n*In the sequel, Shere Khan apparently knows Mowgli's name, by referring him by his actual name instead of just \"man-cub\". It's unknown how Shere Khan knew Mowgli's name in the sequel, though its very likely that he found out when Baloo mentions Mowgli's name before battling the tiger at the climax of the original film.\n*In the planned third installment of the ''Jungle Book'' franchise, Shere Khan was to have escaped from <nowiki/>the statue at the beginning of the movie, and end up captured alongside Baloo and forced into a circus environment. During this time, Shere Khan will also end up regretting his actions from the previous two films and intend to reform as Mowgli and the other animals attempt to rescue them. However, due to ''The'' ''Jungle Book 2''<nowiki/>'s poor sales, it was scrapped. Had that film came to fruition, he would also have been one of the few Disney villains to be reformed.\n*Even though few have actually met Shere Khan, almost every animal in the jungle has heard of him and fear him.\n*In the 2016 film, vultures follow Shere Khan as opposed to the [[Buzzie, Flaps, Ziggy, and Dizzy|vultures]] of the 1967 film being afraid of him. They also seem to indicate his presence, as all the animals look for Shere Khan when they hear the cries of vultures.\n*In the original Rudyard Kipling stories, Shere Khan began influencing the younger wolves against Akela and Mowgli as a way to try to turn the wolves against the man-cub to cast him out and into his clutches. In the 2016 film, he does a similar tactic with the wolf pups as a way of punishing Raksha for raising Mowgli as her own son.\n*Shere Khan's hatred toward men because of their weapons is not without reasons, considering that tigers have become one of the world's most endangered species because of men hunting them (mainly for their fur) and destruction of their habitats in real life. Even Bagheera acknowledged that Shere Khan's hatred of humans stems from a traumatic experience (''what'' the experience was is unknown) and the fact that for a long time, he has been a primary target for hunters.\n*Shere Khan is the only villain to date that survived in his original appearance, but is killed in a live-action adaptation.\n*Shere Khan, based on his ''TaleSpin'' incarnation, was going to be featured in an episode of ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' that would have explored the fates of him, Baloo, [[Rebecca Cunningham]], and the original [[Don Karnage]]. However, the idea was scrapped due to the series not being renewed for a fourth season.\n**Had the idea being used, this would have made Shere Khan the first villain from the Disney Animated Canon to have appeared in ''DuckTales''\n*Shere Khan has been compared to [[wiki:Hannibal Lecter|Hannibal Lecter]] due to his attitude to be normally calm, controlled and polite (even while torturing or abusing someone, like [[Kaa]]) before exploding in a sudden, terrifying and uncontrollable fury toward his victims.\n*Despite being mentioned by name several times, Shere Khan doesn't appear until 47 minutes into the film.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n\n*{{WP|Shere Khan}}\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/b/bc/Favicon(2).ico|Villains|Shere Khan (Disney)|Villains Wiki}}\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{Bonkers}}\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Kingdom Keepers}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khan, Shere}}\n[[ar:\u0634\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646]]\n[[es:Shere Khan]]\n[[fi:Shere Khan]]\n[[fr:Shere Khan]]\n[[it:Shere Khan]]\n[[nl:Shere Khan]]\n[[pl:Shere Khan]]\n[[pt:Shere Khan]]\n[[pt-br:Shere Khan]]\n[[ru:\u0428\u0435\u0440-\u0425\u0430\u043d]]\n[[sv:Shere Khan]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Tigers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Overtakers]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]"
