She is the main antagonist of the episode \"[[From the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22!]]\", the secondary antagonist of season three of the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' 2017 series and also a [[F.O.W.L.]] member.\n\n==Background==\nBlack Heron is the co-founder of the criminal organization F.O.W.L. and one of its top agents. She was recruited by [[Bradford Buzzard]] who insisted on creating their own organization outside of [[S.H.U.S.H.]] called O.W.L. Black Heron found the idea villainous, despite Bradford's claim to the contrary, and suggested adding an F at the beginning to start their new group.\n\nIn the 1960s, she was sent to London to get the recipe for an ancient potion (the [[Gummiberry Juice]]) that F.O.W.L. wanted to utilize for creating superpowered soldiers. Although she managed to get her hands on the recipe, she was stopped by [[Bentina Beakley|Agent 22]] and her partner, freelance agent [[Scrooge McDuck]], and she lost her right arm in the incident.\n\n==Role in the series==\n50 years later, in the events of the episode ''[[From the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22!]]'', Black Heron breaks into McDuck Manor and kidnaps [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] to have her revenge, and to finally get her hands on the recipe for the potion. After learning about that, Scrooge goes on a mission to rescue his friend, unwittingly accompanied by Beakley's granddaughter [[Webby Vanderquack]]. After finding her and stealing the Gummiberry Juice, Webby defeats Black Heron, swiping the rest of the potion in the scuffle, and Heron falls into the sea, leaving only her prosthetic arm behind, implying she might have died from the fall.\n\nAt the very end of the Season 2 episode, \"[[Moonvasion!]]\", it is revealed that Black Heron did survive her fall, though she is still missing her arm, as she's having a meeting with other F.O.W.L. members about defeating the McDuck Family.\n\nIn \"[[Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!]]\", a mosquito bothering Donald is revealed to be a bug, a robotic mosquito linked to F.O.W.L. [[Gandra Dee]] tells the evil agency that the McDuck family found a journal known as \"The Missing Mysteries\", and Black Heron discovers access to find extremely rare relics just as F.O.W.L. continues their plan to take out the McDucks. This is also when she gains a new prosthetic arm.\n\nIn \"[[Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!]]\", she tasks [[Steelbeak]] with using a beam that can raise or lower a target's intelligence, in order to turn Scrooge into a harmless idiot. She is also revealed to have created the reboot show's version of the [[Rescue Rangers]] through lab animal testing of the device.\n\nShe makes a brief appearance in \"[[Let's Get Dangerous!]]\", when she rescues an outed Bradford Buzzard from Scrooge.\n\nIn \"[[The Split Sword of Swanstantine!]]\", Black Heron teams up with Steelbeak, [[John D. Rockerduck]] and Gandra Dee, to reclaim the pieces of the titular sword before Scrooge and his allies do. She faces off with Scrooge throughout the episode, but they lose the pieces to him and his allies. This turns out to be somewhat intentional for a further sinister plot.\n\nIn \"[[The Last Adventure!]]\", F.O.W.L.'s plans come to fruition. Black Heron continues to aid Bradford Buzzard, as he finishes up his final plan; to use the Solego Circuit to create a never ending black hole to forever trap and effectively eradicate all adventurers and allies. Black Heron, who continues to cite F.O.W.L. as an evil organization against Bradford's wishes, is tossed into the black hole as an example. Far from horrified, Black Heron in her final moments congratulates Bradford for finally embracing his villainy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Black Heron, having lost her right arm, is the first known ''DuckTales 2017'' character to be an amputee and known to be a cyborg (before [[Della Duck]]).\n*According to Frank Angones, Black Heron busted Steelbeak out of jail in [[St. Canard]] and gave him his metal beak.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nFrom the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22 2.jpg|Black Heron returns for revenge.\nFrom the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22 6.png\nAdventures in Duckburg (17).png\nPhantomBlotDuckTalesMoonvasion.png|Black Heron with [[Steelbeak]] and [[Phantom Blot]].\nPhantom and Heron.png\nSteelbeak and Black Heron 2.jpg|Black Heron and Steelbeak plot.\nThe Split Sword of Swanstantine! - thumbnail.png\nThe Split Sword of Swanstantine!
