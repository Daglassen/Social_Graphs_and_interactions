It is shown that he can break one board (maybe more). He lost to Milton at the tournament and got a nipple twister from him, resulting in the </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Wasabi Warriors</span><span style=\"line-height:21px;\"> losing their second belt. Sensei Ty told him to break Jack's leg, then got kicked out by his own sensei after doing so.</span>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:21px;\">It is revealed that he is in the Seventh grade, but is 19, he is also known to have a little sister. (in the episode Boo Gi NiIghts) he lives with his mother and his sister and has some pet cats.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:21px;\">Frank tends to hang around Sensei Ty due to the fact that he is the closest person to Frank's age group. He is known to not be very street smart or book smart. This shows in Clash of the Titans when Jack states that Frank is 19 and still in the seventh grade.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:21px;\">He has crush on Kim saying he likes how her hair smells and wanting to hug her. However in The Wrath of Swan, he tried to sabatoge her along with the rest of the Black Dragons.</p>\n[[Category:Kickin' It characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
