They are the 2nd Dimension versions of [[Norm]], created by 2nd Dimension's [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension)|Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] to enforce his rule in Danville and led by his general [[Perry the Platypus (2nd Dimension)|Perry the Platyborg]].\n==Role in the film==\nThey first appeared when Doofenshmirtz orders them to capture the original\u00a0Perry, along with his owners\u00a0Phineas Flynn\u00a0and\u00a0Ferb Fletcher\u00a0after they learn about Perry-1's occupation as a secret agent. The Norm-Bots try to capture the three, but they escape.\n\nThey later appear when Doofenshmirtz lay down a plan to successfully trap Phineas and Ferb by using a captive Perry as a hostage. The Norm-Bots later hold the three, along with the boys' sister\u00a0Candace-1, prisoner as Doofenshmirtz orders them to fix his Other DImension-inator in his ultimate plan to unleash his Norm-Bots into the 1st Dimension Tri-State Area. The boys refuse, but when\u00a0Doofenshmirtz-1\u00a0found out exactly what the boys did to power up the machine, Doofenshmirtz orders his Norm-Bots to send Perry-1, the kids, and even Doofenshmirtz-1 to their doom by having them fed to his pet\u00a0Goozim. However, Candace manages to rescue the five by defeating a number of Norm-Bots right before she herself is captured by several more.\n\nDespite Candace being captured and the five having escaped, Doofenshmirtz couldn't care less as he still got his machine to work. With that in mind, Doofenshmritz unleashes his vast army of Norm-Bots into the 1st Dimension Tri-State Area, and they start threatening people to submit themselves to Doof's reign. However, thanks to the efforts of their friends, Phineas-1 and Ferb-1 are able to take down several Norm-Bots. As Doofenshmirtz is about to unleash more Norm-Bots, Phineas-1 and Perry-1 arrive to stop him by smashing the satellite, causing the remaining Norm-Bots to deactivate and fall into the pavements, much to Doofenshmirtz's anger. However, Doofenshmirtz later changes his mind of taking over the Tri-State Area after the Doofenshmirtz-1 convinces him to stop by giving him his childhood toy train, in order to resolve the only backstory that Doof had in his childhood. Touched by this and feeling very embarrassed about the rampage he has caused, Doofenshmirtz revealed that he has implanted a self-destruct mechanism to all Norm-Bots and activates it, causing all Norm-Bots to self-destruct, leaving no evidence of the invasion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*It appears that in the movie they used CGI for the Norm Bots unlike the original.\n*They appear in the Danville level of [[Disney Universe]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"200\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nNormbot's defeat.jpg|Norm Bots' defeat\nAcross the Second Dimension Wii screenshot 2.jpg\nNormpatrolBots1.jpg\nNormbot2.jpg|Norm Bot with Norm face\nNormbot1.jpg|Normbot with Scary face\nNormpatrolBots2.jpg\nDisney universe bad guy concepts by seandonaldson-d78clmf.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]"
