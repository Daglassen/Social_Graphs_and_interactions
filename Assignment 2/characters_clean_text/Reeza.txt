Reeza is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Reeza is a Gerudo soldier who guards the front entrance to the palace in Gerudo Town with Ploka. If Link speaks to Reeza, she says that Riju, Chief of the Gerudo, is a kind person for allowing visitors during these tough times. If Link asks about the tough times she is referring to, Reeza snaps at Link that it is a Gerudo problem and is none of his business. Reeza allows Link into the palace, but warns him not to get in the Chief's way. When Link ends the conversation, Reeza tells Link not to be rude to Riju. If Link speaks to Reeza after speaking to Riju for the first time, she asks what makes Link so special that Riju trusts him to retrieve the Thunder Helm. She then warns him that the task is not simple, as the skilled thieves slipped past all of the guards. Reeza recommends that Link goes to the barracks to learn more, as the soldiers have been investigating the theft.
After Link calms Naboris, Reeza talks about how much it stressed Riju and Buliara. She thanks Link for lifting that burden from them. If Link asks her to talk about Riju, she snaps at Link, demanding he call her by her full title, Lady Riju. She goes on to explain that Riju has a softer side, but can only let it show in private due to her expectations of leadership. If Link asks her to talk about Buliara, Reeza is offended that Link does not know about her. She then explains that Buliara is the best spear master in Gerudo Town and that she inspired her to train with the spear when she was young.
