Tough as nails, he's a man in the stereotypical meaning of the term, being brash and short sighted with limited intelligence and using third person when speaking of himself. Training and muscle-obsessed with an ego to boot, Ultimoose frequently tends to insult people by calling them \"little girls\" or \"ladies\". He sports a pair of mechanical antlers that can transform into a variety of weapons and other devices.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Deja Foo]]\", Ultimoose merged with the Night Master and became the Night Mooster, but was reverted back to normal after [[Yang (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yang]] reversed time and and retrieved the [[Amnesulet]] first. As of \"[[Welcome to the Dark Tomorrow]]\", Ultimoose has become affiliated with the League of Evil.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is a mash-up of the words \"ultimate\" and \"moose\".\n*His outfit and hairstyle are similar to that of the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Wonder Man]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nultimoose confrontation.jpg\nultimoose delivers.jpg\nUltimoose Pirate.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Moose]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
