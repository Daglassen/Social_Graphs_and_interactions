He is working on repairing Zora's Domain as an apprentice under the Zora smithy {{Term|BotW|Dento|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Fronk and I are Master Dento's faithful apprentices. Fronk and I are always striving to better ourselves in the workshop.

However, our materials are a bit depleted...|Ledo|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Ruta|link}} is appeased by {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}, Fronk can be found hammering a pillar in Zora's Domain while conversing with himself.<ref>{{Cite|They say {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}} has calmed down, and yet...|Fronk|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to him, Fronk will apologize and explain that he was talking to himself.<ref>{{Cite|Ah! It is you, Link! I am sorry... I was talking to myself.|Fronk|BotW}}</ref> Fronk says that after Vah Ruta started rampaging, his wife {{Term|BotW|Mei|link}} went out to go fishing.<ref>{{Cite|The truth is... My wife Mei left and hasn't come back yet. After the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Ruta}} started rampaging, she went out to go fishing like everything was normal.|Fronk|BotW}}</ref> Even though the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast|link}} is appeased, she still has not returned.<ref>{{Cite|And now {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}} has settled down, but she still hasn't returned...|Fronk|BotW}}</ref> Fronk wishes he had made her stay and wonders what he should do.<ref>{{Cite|I'm afraid the worst has happened... If only I had stopped her from leaving! Oh, what do I do?!|Fronk|BotW}}</ref> If Link offers to find Mei, Fronk expresses his gratitude and apologizes for placing this burden on him.<ref>{{Cite|Link... You saved Zora's Domain, and now you're going to help me find my Mei, as well? You are a true Champion! I am sorry for placing this burden on you, but please... Please bring her home!|Fronk|BotW}}</ref> This unlocks the {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}}, \"{{Term|BotW|A Wife Washed Away|link}}\". Fronk says he will help Link however he can to find Mei.<ref>{{Cite|If you are going to look for Mei, I will help you however I can.|Fronk|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link asks about Mei, Fronk again says she is his wife and the mother of his children, {{Term|BotW|Tumbo|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Keye|link}}. He says she spends her days catching fish and selling them at the {{Term|BotW|Coral Reef|link}} {{Term|BotW|General Store|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|She spends her days catching fish and selling them at the general store.|Fronk|BotW}}</ref> Fronk describes Mei as being very lively and cheerful, believing {{Term|BotW|Tumbo}} gets that from her.<ref>{{Cite|Unlike me, she is very lively and cheerful...
