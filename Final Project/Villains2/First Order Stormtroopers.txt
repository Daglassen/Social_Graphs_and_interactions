With their stark white armor and armed with powerful weapons, they serve as the enforcers of the First Order much like their [[Stormtroopers|predecessors]] had done under the fallen [[Galactic Empire|Empire]].\n\n==Background==\nStormtroopers of the First Order are much more formidable than their Imperial counterparts in the [[Galactic Empire]], and are more skilled, more versatile, better equipped and much more accurate in shooting. They are also indoctrinated and trained since birth to support the First Order's cause and beliefs, willingly serving the First Order with fervor and zeal.\n\n===Personality===\nThe First Order Stormtroopers are loyal and obedient, and they follow orders without question from high-ranking officials such as [[Captain Phasma]] and [[General Hux|Armitage Hux]], and [[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]]'s apprentice, [[Kylo Ren]].\n\nThe First Order Stormtroopers are also very merciless in battle, killing their enemies or innocent civilians without any hesitation, guilt, or remorse. Despite this, like [[Finn]], most of them have a sense of justice, honor, good morals and principles.\n\nUnlike their predecessors, the First Order Stormtroopers are skillful soldiers, being very good at aiming and shooting for their targets, and have been trained in hand-to-hand and melee combat.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Marksmanship:''' First Order Stormtroopers are trained at very young ages to be skilled in utilizing blaster pistols and blaster rifles.\n*'''Melee Combat:''' First Order Stormtroopers are trained at very young ages to be skilled in utilizing melee weapons, such as riot batons.\n*'''Hand-To-Hand Combatant:''' First Order Stormtroopers are trained at very young ages to be skilled hand-to-hand combatants.\n\n===Weapons and Equipment===\n*'''[[Blaster (Star Wars)|SE-44C blaster pistol]]:''' First Order Stormtroopers utilizes the SE-44C blaster pistols as their weapon of choice.\n*'''[[Blaster (Star Wars)|F-11D blaster rifle]]:''' First Order Stormtroopers utilizes the F-11D blaster rifles as their second weapon of choice.\n*'''[[Blaster (Star Wars)|D-93 Incinerator flamethrower]]:''' First Order Stormtroopers utilizes the D-93 Incinerator flamethrowers as their third weapon of choice.\n*'''[[Blaster (Star Wars)|Z6 riot control baton]]:''' First Order Stormtroopers utilizes the Z6 riot control batons as their fourth weapon of choice.\n*'''[[Blaster (Star Wars)|FWMB-10 repeating blaster]]:''' First Order Stormtroopers utilizes the FWMB-10 repeating blasters as their fifth weapon of choice.\n*'''First Order stormtrooper armor:''' First Order Stormtroopers utilizes armor to protect them from there enemies in battle. First Order stormtrooper armor is strong to the point where it can not only apparently withstand an attack from a [[Wookiees|Wookiee]] (as Wookiees are one of the galaxy's most physically powerful species), but it grants them greater flexibility, their helmets are also made out of Betaplast.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''===\nThe stormtroopers appear in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''. They are now part of the [[First Order]], a faction formed from a splinter group of the Galactic Empire, run by [[Supreme Leader Snoke]]. They are led by [[General Hux]] and [[Captain Phasma]], coming in a variety of variants, such as snowtroopers, flametroopers, riot control, and megablaster stormtroopers. Unlike their Imperial predecessors, First Order stormtroopers are more intelligent, stronger, and more adaptable. They are capable of melee combat and are armed with stronger armor capable of apparently withstanding an attack by a [[Wookiees|Wookiee]] and better, more advanced weaponry. They also have a better aim. They are first seen tearing apart a village on [[Jakku]] in search of the map to [[Luke Skywalker]]'s location, in which they slaughter the inhabitants on Kylo's orders. They proceed to engage their enemies on several fronts during the course of the film, including the Battle of [[Takodana]].\n\nOne notable stormtrooper in the film is FN-2187 (later known as [[Finn]]) who deserts the First Order upon seeing both the death of one of his squad mates (FN-2003) and seeing the First Order slaughter innocent bystanders on Jakku. He then proceeds to help prisoner and Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] escape from the First Order and crashes on Jakku. Proceeding with Poe's mission to return Poe's droid BB-8 and the map he carries to Luke's location to the Resistance, Finn encounters and befriends the scavenger, [[Rey]], and the heroes [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] along the way. Finn later helps the [[Resistance]] when Rey is kidnapped by Kylo by providing valuable intel on [[Starkiller Base]], allowing the Resistance to destroy it. Finn also duels Kylo during the destruction of Starkiller Base with [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s lightsaber, and though he is defeated, the Force-sensitive Rey subsequently takes up the weapon and defeats the dark sider.\n\n===''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''===\nThe stormtroopers appear in ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'', where [[Captain Phasma]] orders the captured Finn and [[Rose Tico]] to be executed after they sold out to the First Order by [[DJ]]. Before they were beheaded by two stormtroopers, [[Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo]] destroyed the ''[[Supremacy]]'' by jumping the Resistance cruiser to lightspeed at the First Order fleet. Thanks to Holdo's sacrifice, Finn and Rose escaped custody and fought the stormtroopers with [[BB-8]]'s help, resulting in Captain Phasma's death.\n\n===''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]''===\nStormtroopers appear in ''Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker''.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===\nThe First Order Stormtroopers appear in [[Oh My Disney]] where they act as security guards. When [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]] bumps into one of them, they chase her for using an unauthorized pop-up without a permit. When Vanellope runs backstage, the Stormtroopers ask [[Grumpy]] if he has seen her to which he confirms. After Vanellope glitches into the [[Disney Princess|princesses]]' dressing room, the Stormtroopers decide to look for her in the ''[[Air Bud (series)|Air Bud]]'' pavilion.\n\n==Disney Parks==\nIn [[December 17]], [[2015]], the First Order Stormtroopers had began meet-and-greet sessions in ''[[Tomorrowland (Hong Kong Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]]'' at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], the second meet-and-greet characters as part of its [[Hong Kong Disneyland 10th Anniversary|10th anniversary celebration]] since [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]] in the month before, and in conjunction with the release of ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Disneyland Resort debuts Broadway-style live show and new attractions to bring on festive cheer during the 10th Anniversary|url=http://news-en.hongkongdisneyland.com/PressReleases/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?AssetId=01ff4b53-f55b-432a-8048-8622068d31de}}</ref> They interact with guests as they explore Tomorrowland.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*First Order Stormtroopers are equipped with armor of such strength that it is stated by [[Captain Phasma]] that not even a Wookiee like [[Chewbacca]] can break it, but it is unknown if this statement is fully accurate.\n*Unlike the Galactic Empire's Stormtroopers, the Stormtroopers of the First Order are skilled in melee combat to the point where they can fight on even terms against someone wielding a lightsaber, as evidenced when former Stormtrooper [[Finn]] fought the Stormtrooper FN-2199 (commonly referred to as TR-8R in public media), who utilized a lightsaber-resistant riot-baton.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stormtroopers]]\n*[[Death Troopers]]\n*[[Shoretroopers]]\n*[[Scout Troopers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Stormtrooper (First Order)}}\n*{{SW|url=/databank/first-order-stormtroopers|text=First Order Stormtroopers}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n\n[[pt-br:Stormtroopers da Primeira Ordem]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Sequel Trilogy characters]]\n[[Category:First Order characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph cameos]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Star Tours characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Resistance characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Galaxy's Edge characters]]"
