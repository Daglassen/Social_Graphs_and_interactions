She is the baddest girl who was part of [[Alana Rivera|Alana]] and [[Bianca|Bianca's]] posse. She is portrayed by Andrea Edwards.\n\n\n\n==History==\nLoca is a member of Alana's (and, later on, Bianca's) posse. She is rough and does the \"bad work\" for Alana (and then Bianca). She is a tall girl whom nobody dares to mess with. She is also romantically interested in Eddie; she likes to give him arm punches every time she sees him. Loca was with Alana and Muffy when they joined Raven's protest against Principal Lawler's decision to require all students to wear school uniforms.\n\nDuring Raven's sleepover, Raven told her and the others that she was psychic, but they thought it was part of her practical joke when it really was not.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 2===\n*\"[[Don't Have a Cow]]\"\n*\"[[Run Raven Run]]\"\n*\"[[Clothes Minded (That's So Raven)|Clothes Minded]]\"\n*\"[[Shake, Rattle, and Rae]]\"\n\n===Season 3===\n*\"[[Boyz 'N Commotion]]\"\n*\"[[Gettin' Outta Dodge]]\"\n\n===Season 4===\n*\"[[When 6021 Met 4267]]\"\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being a tough member of Alana's crew, she is shown to be nice and polite to Eddie and Raven\n*She (along with [[Muffy]]) are one are the only crew members and enemies of Raven that reformed.\n*Her name (in feminine form) which means the word in Spanish.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{That's So Raven}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:That's So Raven characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
