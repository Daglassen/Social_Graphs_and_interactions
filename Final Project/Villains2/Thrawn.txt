He is a Grand Admiral who serves the [[Galactic Empire]]. Thrawn is a Chiss, a humanoid species characterized by their blue skin, dark blue hair, and red eyes.\n\n==Background==\nThrawn started out as an officer in the Chiss Ascendancy Expeditionary Force, the navy of the civilization from which he came, and loyally served in it as a commander for many years. He was part of a scouting force to go search for possible allies by the time of the Clone Wars. Somewhere in the Outer Rim, Thrawn came into contact with [[Anakin Skywalker]], and would ultimately come to hold the man in high regard. At some point, he and his people discovered a threat looming in the Unknown Regions of Space. Out of love and a fierce loyalty towards his people, Thrawn selflessly volunteered to venture off into Imperial space in order to assess their military might and see if they would make a good ally to help defend the galaxy from what the evils on the outer regions of the galaxy. In order to do this, Thrawn was formally exiled from Chiss space for military insubordination, although this was all staged in order to publicly explain the absence of one of the Ascendancy's highest ranking officers. Thrawn selected a planet in Wild Space as his spot of \"exile\", as he knew that it was on the edge of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Sure enough, a [[Imperial Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] visited the planet after several months and Thrawn was discovered by the captain.\n\nThrawn was able to win an audience with [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]], and, in order to ensure a possible alliance between his people and the Empire, Thrawn offered to give Palpatine astrological information of the Unknown Regions, as he deducted that Palpatine had an interest in the region. Most unexpectedly, the Emperor gave Thrawn a naval commission. Thrawn used this new development to his advantage, and infiltrated the Imperial Navy, posing as a loyalist to the Empire, but truly only doing it for his people and not the Emperor, who he knew was actually evil.\n\nWith help from his aid, translator, and fellow officer, Eli Vanto, Thrawn quickly moved up the ranks, gaining recognition for his unorthodox but effective military tactics. The Imperial Admiralty came to despise him, trying to use every opportunity they could to have him discharged, but after each court martial he came out unscathed, even being promoted to commodore after one of them. It was during this time that he met Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]], an aspiring businesswoman and politician hoping to claw her way up to the top. The two of them became close friends and used each other's own strengths to help the other rise to the higher echelons of the Empire. Thrawn himself was primarily tasked with capturing pirates and putting down rebellions in unstable sectors. Throughout his early career, he hunted a mysterious operator named \"Nightswan\", who he later found out had been orchestrating many of the rebellions across the galaxy, many of which would eventually come together and form the [[Rebel Alliance]]. Nightswan proved to be Thrawn's intellectual match and a brilliant military commander in his own right. After Thrawn became an admiral, he was sent with the Imperial Fleet to go put down an insurgency on the planet Batonn. During the siege, Thrawn went to confront Nightswan in secret, and the admiral realized that his longtime enemy was, in fact, a pirate whom he had captured many years earlier. Thrawn returned to his vessel to prepare for the battle, which commenced not long after. Thrawn and the Empire emerged the victors after explosives were ignited on the surface, destroying the entire rebel base and with it over half of the city's population that remained. In actuality, it was Governor Pryce who was responsible for igniting the explosives, as Thrawn generally tried to avoid collateral damage. Even so, he took full responsibility for both the victory and the action that was taken in order to win it, as he was the one in command. Much to his own surprise and that of his fellow admirals, such as [[Kassius Konstantine]], he was promoted to the rank of \"Grand Admiral\" by the Emperor himself.\n\nAs he had a tendancy to achieve victory after victory, Thrawn was not well-known to the Rebellion at large. His skills of deduction allowed him to come to the conclusion that [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Darth Vader]] were the same man, although he never mentioned such in Palpatine's presence. Additionally, through his study of Imperial trade routes, supply lines, and logistic resource transportation, Thrawn was finally able to put together that the Empire was partaking in a massive construction project, which he later found out was codenamed \"Project [[Death Star]]\". At one point he asked [[Palpatine]] about this, and, in turn, was fascinated by Thrawn's intelligence. The Emperor was also fascinated by Thrawn's culture, which hailed from the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, where he believed the source of the Dark side originated. Due to this, and his prowess in tactical and physical combat, Thrawn often held the Emperor's favor in spite of Palpatine's usual hatred of non-humans.\n\n===Personality===\nThrawn is highly intelligent, calm, level-headed, and observant, as he believes that understanding an enemy's culture, history, philosophy, and art is crucial in order to discern their tactics and ultimately defeat them in battle. He is tactically superior to many other Imperial leaders who often used the same strategies, and, as a result, were defeated by the Rebels. When Thrawn is dispatched to fight [[Cham Syndulla]] and his Free Ryloth Movement, the latter does not expect his adversary's attacks to be as precise and devastating as they turned out to be. He also used situations to his advantage and could formulate creative strategies in his head that could be achieved without error.\n\nUnlike most other Imperial officers, Thrawn is not a particularly cruel or malicious individual. As a matter of fact, he is quite gentlemanly, being polite and cordial with even his own enemies. Thrawn is also very patient, preferring to study the tactics of his enemies rather than to instantly become the aggressor, even if it means allowing them to escape. However, Thrawn's patience does have its limits, as he sometimes becomes annoyed or enraged when others either question his views or fail to understand his appreciation of art. Despite this, he is not known to kill his own men like Vader and Tarkin are.\n\nAlthough antagonistic and quite ruthless, Thrawn is not pure evil. Despite his ruthlessness, he generally preferred to avoid causing collateral damage, as was demonstrated during the Battle of Batonn, where he attempted to negotiate with the enemy. However, although reluctantly, Thrawn sometimes condoned civilian casualties if it meant a sure victory, as shown during the Liberation of Lothal.\n\nEven though he never told anyone, not even his most trusted friend, Eli Vanto, Thrawn despised the oppressive, racist, and corrupt Imperial culture, viewing many of his fellow officers as either evil or downright stupid. He was also one of the few within the Empire to realize how evil the Emperor actually is, even going as far to speculate that he could be in touch with the Force. Being a pragmatist, he believed the Empire to be a necessary evil and that serving it is the best way to defend his people. Ironically, he managed to obtain the rank of Grand Admiral, meaning that he is one of the highest ranking members of a civilization he neither adores nor originally comes from. Even so, the fact that he purposefully infiltrated the Imperial hierarchy means that he has to follow Imperial directives, meaning that, in order to fit in, he comes across as far more cruel than he actually is on a moral level. He believes in the ends justifying the means, which is evident when he rigs a speeder to kill a mechanic to set an example. Finally, Thrawn inspires loyalty from his men. Where people like [[Darth Vader]] and Grand Moff [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] seek to punish those who fail, Thrawn sees those failures as opportunities, so that his men can learn to do better and succeed. He views death as a means of punishing soldiers as being wasteful. Despite all of that, Thrawn is still a cold-blooded Imperial and one of the Rebels' most dangerous adversaries.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThrawn is a member of the Chiss species, having blue skin, red eyes, and blue-black hair. He has a slender, yet muscular build.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''High-Level Intellect/Expert Tactician/Leader:''' Thrawn is highly intelligent. As the Grand Admiral of the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial Navy]], Thrawn is a highly skilled tactician and a very capable leader.\n*'''Master Hand-To-Hand Combatant:''' Thrawn is highly skilled in unarmed combat, as he was capable of defeating two [[Imperial Sentry Droid]]s at once in a training session. He also defeated [[Agent Kallus|Kallus]].\n\n==Appearances==\n\n=== Rebels ===\nGrand Admiral Thrawn made his debut in the third season premiere, ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow|Steps Into Shadow]]''. He is the Commander of the Seventh Fleet. He earned the respect of many Imperials such as Arihnda Pryce for his effective stratigies. He earned his rank during the Battle of Batonn, although his critics noted that Thrawn killed far more innocent civilians than rebels in the battle.\n\nHe first appeared with Arihnda Pryce, the Imperial Governor of the Lothal System, at a meeting with Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Agent Alexsandr Kallus, and Admiral Kassius Konstantine. While Konstantine dismisses Governor Pryce's theory that the Rebel Network is a galaxy-wide threat to the Empire, Thrawn agreed with it and vows to pull the Rebels apart piece by piece. Later, Governor Pryce contacts him from Reklam station to tell him the Rebel Fleet is doing what he predicted only for him to tell her that is not the Rebel Fleet and to let them go.\n\nThrawn made his first major appearance in the episode \"[[Hera's Heroes]]\", when he aided Captain Slavin in capturing the Tann Province of [[Ryloth]], which is Hera's Home. Slavin made Hera's Home his headqaurters. When [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]] (disguised as a Scout Trooper) and Hera infiltrated the Syndulla House, while Thrawn had Slavin tighten up the defenses. Slavin told him that it wasn't necessary and that rebel activity is far away. However, Thrawn was able to realize that rebel activity is in the house. He and Slavin letter ran into Hera (who stole her family's Kalikori back) and had a Scout Trooper (which was actually Ezra) take her to Slavin's Office for questioning. Despite of Slavin's protests about the questioning, Thrawn was able to find out Hera is [[Cham Syndulla]]'s daughter who is the nemesis of Slavin. When Ezra tried to react, Thrawn stunned him. When Slavin asked Thrawn how did he know that the trooper was a rebel, he responded that rebels always had friends rushing to the rescue. Thrawn then had Slavin imprison Hera and Ezra in order to make a prisoner exchange between the father and daughter. He had Hera's Kalikori transported to his ship, and left Slavin incharge of the exchange. Unknown to both of them Hera had [[C1-10P]] hotwire the house with explosives. When the prisoner exchange happened Thrawn on a Imperial Light Cruiser witnessed Hera blowing up the house. He then ordered the officers to allow the rebels to escape and made no attempt to stop them.\n\nThrawn then returned in the episode \"[[Iron Squadron]]\" where he heard news that a rebel cell called the Iron Squadron over the Mykapo System, that was led by Mart Marttin (The nephew of Rebel Commander [[Jun Sato]], who is the nemesis of Thrawn). Thrawn was curious about the cell and dispatched Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]] on a single Light Cruiser and two TIE Fighter Transports to deal with the threat. When the Ghost crew along with Sato came to rescue Mart, Konstantine send a call for reinforcements to Thrawn. When Thrawn arrived Konstantine's Light Cruiser was badly damaged. Thrawn the spoke to Jun Sato over a transmitter. Sato vowed to Thrawn the they will meet again, in which Thrawn agreed and let the rebels escape. Thrawn then asked Konstantine if he called for reinforcements. The Admiral tried to deny claiming he was calling to tell him the rebels had fled the system but, Thrawn saw through his lie which forced the Admiral to bow his head down in embarrassment.\n\nThrawn made his second major appearance in the episode \"[[An Inside Man]]\", when after the Lothal Insurgency led by the former Lothal Governor, [[Ryder Azadi]], begun sabotaging vehicles from the Imperial Factory on Lothal. The Imperial High Command dispatched Thrawn to investigate. [[Agent Kallus]], [[Arihnda Pryce|Governor Pryce]], and [[Yogar Lyste|Lieutenant Lyste]], summoned the workers of the factory for an assembly. Thrawn told them that the vehicles assembled in this factory malfunctioned faster then others, and that this isn't tolerable. He then forced [[Morad Sumar]], a member of Azadi's cell to ride a malfunctioned AvA 614 speeder bike to his death. Sumar's death freighted the workers, Kanan and Ezra (who were disguised as workers), and even Kallus, but Pryce smirked.\n\nThrawn then told the workers everything they make will be tested personally by themselves. He also told Pryce the she shouldn\u2019t have compromised security by hiring locals. Thrawn, Pryce, and Kallus, were inspecting vehicles when Pryce thought if Thrawn's new fighter initiative, the [[TIE Defender]], was also compromised. Thrawn explained that the project was top secret and that he had ordered for anyone who attempts to view it without his clearance codes to be killed on sight. When Kallus (who is a secret rebel spy, Fulcrum) asked for more information, Pryce told that all he needed to know was that Thrawn had a new fighter initiative. Thrawn then explained to Kallus the purpose of victory and had him activate a sabotaged [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP]], when the walker collapsed Thrawn gestured his men to arrest the worker. Later, Thrawn was in his office when he asked Kallus and Lyste about an old Jedi Symbol. Kallus was able to identify that it was the mark of the Phoenix Squadron (A well known rebel cell). Thrawn stated that the rebels have a connection to the planet and will always return. Later, Pryce was in Thrawn's Office along with him when Thrawn stated that an unauthorized [[C1-10P|C1 unit]] access the Information Office, and stole his plans. Later the rebels escaped with Thrawn's plans with the help of Kallus, when Ryder attacked the East Gate of the Factory. However, Thrawn was able to realize that the rebels have a mole in the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]], and decided to wait and have the spy's actions reveal themselves.\n\nLater, Thrawn returned in the episode \"[[Warhead]]\" where he had Agent Kallus and the Seventh Fleet dispatch Imperial Inflitrators such as EXD-9 to survey planets for potential rebel bases. When the infiltrators returned to base EXD-9 exploded, because of being compromised by rebels, due to Kallus' Fulcrum warning. Kallus was later summoned to the Chimaera by Thrawn. Thrawn was surprised that the rebels compromised an Inflitrator Droid, but it narrowed his search to ninety-four planets suspected of housing a rebel base.\n\nThrawn then made his third major appearance in the episode \"[[Through Imperial Eyes]]\" when Kallus' Fulcrum transmissions caught his attention. He invited ISB Colonel [[Wullf Yularen]] (Who was Kallus' ISB Instructor at the Imperial Academy) to help him find the rebel spy Fulcrum. Nextly Thrawn's fleet arrived to Lothal shortly after Kallus and Lyste apprehended a Shuttle Thief (Which was Ezra, who got captured to warn Kallus). Thrawn's next move was to summon Lyste and Kallus to his Stardestroyer, The Chimaera. Lyste brought the prisoner to Thrawn in order to show the Grand Admiral how effective he is dealing with a rebel threat. When they arrived on Thrawn's Command Ship and went to Thrawn's Office they saw him battling his own [[Imperial Sentry Droid]]s. Once Thrawn closed his door in his dojo, they were greeted in the main office by Admiral Kassius Konstantine and ISB Colonel Wullf Yularen.\n\nWhen Thrawn entered his main office he told Kallus, Lyste, and Konstantine that they will all by interrogated by Yularen in order to find their spy. Once Kallus, Lyste, and Konstantine left, Governor Pryce asked Thrawn if they made any progress so far. In which Thrawn responded that he was sure that their spy was present at their interviews. When Yularen noted that an off-ship transmission was sent to the rebels after the prisoner was transferred to the Chimaera. Then the three went to interrogate the prisoner. Unknown to them Kallus has deceived Lyste and switched his code cylinder with his own in order to frame Lyste of being Fulcrum. When they arrived they noticed that survelliance was deactivated, the guards weren't at their post, and the prisoner was gone. When Yularen accessed the cell records he stated is was \"Lyste\" who freed the prisoner and deactivated survelliance, which made the three suspicous of the lieutenant.\n\nWhen Thrawn returned to his office, Kallus and Ezra (the Shuttle Thief) successfully erased Atollon and added a decoy planet on Thrawn's list and sent the clearance codes to Kanan and Rex from Thrawn's Office. When Thrawn entered Ezra (disguised as Lyste) hid behind one of Thrawn's collections of art. When Kallus reprogrammed the sentry droids and sent them to kill Thrawn, in order for Ezra to escape. Ezra did escape, but Thrawn noticed him and shouted \"Lyste!\" Shortly after that Thrawn destroyed the sentries that attacked him and told Yularen of \"Lyste's Treachery\". In response Yularen sent Pryce to arrest the rebels (disguised as stormtroopers) on the incoming Imperial Shuttle. However that plan failed when Lyste stunned Pryce (Since Kallus deceived him into believing Pryce is Fulcrum), with Yularen witnessing Lyste's treachery. The rebels managed to flee and Kallus framed Lyste by returning Lyste's cylinder to him and taking his cylinder back. As the rebels were leaving Kallus told them he is staying in order to continue spying on the Empire. When Yularen arrived with reinforcements Kallus publicly accused Lieutenant Lyste as Fulcrum and had him arrested by stormtroopers. Later, in Thrawn's Office Konstantine and Pryce congratulated Kallus for his brave efforts and the three were dismissed by Thrawn. Alone in his office with Yularen, the two realized that Kallus is Fulcrum and Thrawn decided to use him to find the rebel base, which left Yularen stunned that his \"star pupil\" betrayed the Empire.\n\nThrawn returned in the following episode \"[[Secret Cargo]]\", where Imperial Senator, [[Mon Mothma]], was accused of high treason for speaking up and blaming [[Emperor Palpatine]] for a massacre of innocent & peaceful protesters. Thrawn, Governor Pryce, and Admiral Konstantine were charged with bringing Mon Mothma to justice for her crimes against the Emperor. Although Thrawn's Seventh Fleet blockaded the system that Mon Mothma and the Ghost Crew were attempting to escape. Thrawn deduced the they were going to escape the system through the Archeon Pass, in the Archeon Nebula, which was a favorite of smugglers. When Pryce stated their their capitol ships can't follow them through the Pass, Thrawn replied the he will send the Empire's best pilot, Vult Skerris, on the [[TIE Defender]], Thrawn's new fighter initiative to flush the rebels out of the pass. Thrawn ordered Pryce and Admiral Konstantine to intercept the [[Ghost (starship)|Ghost]] (the ship the Mon Mothma was on) when Commander Vult Skerris of the Imperial Navy flushes them out of the pass, and capture Mothma; Alive. No matter how much Pryce, Konstantine, and Skerris tried Mothma successfully escaped with the Ghost Crew.\n\nThrawn was mentioned in the following episode \"[[Double Agent Droid]]\" by the Controller, an Imperial Intelligence Officer, that he and his crew of the Imperial Listener Ship were dispatched by Thrawn to find the location of the Rebel Base of the Phoenix Squadron. In order to find the base, the Controller reprogrammed [[C1-10P]](Chopper) and had him trap the Ghost Crew in the cargo bay of their ship. The Controller was close to finding their base, however Hera sent back a powerful electrical signal to the Controller through Chopper, which destroyed the Listener Ship, killed the Controller and his underlings, thwarted Thrawn's plan, and freed Chopper from Imperial Control.\n\nThrawn made his fourth major appearance in the season finale,\"[[Zero Hour]]\", where he arrived to the Imperial Factory on Lothal, and was greeted by Governor Pryce and Admiral Konstantine. He escorted by [[Death Troopers]] told them he has urgent news and proceeded to have a secret meeting with the latter. When Konstantine asked if the secrecy was really necessary, in which Thrawn responded that they still have a traitor in the midst and contacted Tarkin. (Unknown to all but Thrawn, Kallus was secretly listening to their conversation) Whilst, the conversation was happening Thrawn informed Tarkin that the Phoenix Squadron was planning an attack on Lothal's TIE Defender Factories. Tarkin thought the rebels would dare, but Thrawn reassured him that they would. Thrawn also informed Tarkin the his Fleet was finally ready to lay siege on Chopper Base (Phoenix Squardron's secret HQ). Tarkin ordered Thrawn to take prisoners in order to make examples of them. Thrawn after the meeting followed Kallus along with his Death Troopers. Thrawn then used a transmission jammer in order to jam Kallus' Fulcrum transmission to \"This is Fulcrum with urgent news, Thrawn knows about...\" He startled Kallus by reciting the Fulcrum code phrase \"By the light of Lothal's Moons.\" Thrawn preceded in telling Kallus the rebels won't receive his warning which made Kallus fight him. While the fight happened Thrawn successfully defeated Kallus and had his Death Troopers take him into custody, however Kallus managed to send his warning to rebels during the fight. Now having captured Kallus, he showed him how he tracked General Dodonna's Fleet and Kallus' warning into one point and deciphered the planet to be [[Atollon]]. Thrawn ordered Konstantine to take the Seventh Fleet there.\n\nOnce arrived to Atollon with himself, Governor Pryce, and the captive Kallus in the tow, on the bridge of the ''Chimaera'', he ordered Konstantine to keep his [[Imperial Interdictor|Interdictor Cruiser]] back until Thrawn orders him to do other-wise. During the battle of the sky, Thrawn had the capital ship hold their position and let the rebels come to them. During the battle of the sky, Konstantine disobeyed Thrawn's orders and went to stop Commander Sato's ship, the ''Phoenix Nest'', but it was a trap which resulted in Konstantine's death, Commander Sato sacrificing himself, and it allowed Ezra and Chopper to escape the blockade on the [[Nightbrother]]. Following the incident the Rebel Fleet was decimated and it trapped the surviving rebel ships on Atollon, which later begun the planetary siege. Thrawn ordered Pryce that she is in charge of the blockade and he went to command the planetary invasion, while Kallus laughed at him. Thrawn was surprised and asked him that he found the deaths of his friends amusing. Kallus then taunted him and said the he is about to fail. Once on the surface, Thrawn ordered his men to storm the base, destroy any rebel ships that attempt to leave, and if possible capture the rebel officers. Although Thrawn's army won, [[The Bendu]] arrived and trashed most of the Imperial Forces and allowed the rebels to escape the planet. When Thrawn ordered his men to shot Bendu out of the sky, Ezra and Chopper arrived with [[Sabine Wren|Sabine]], [[Fenn Rau]], and the Mandalorians which took out the remaining Interdictor and allowed the Rebel Fleet along with Kallus (who escaped the Empire and formally joined the Rebellion) to leave Atollon. After the battle, Thrawn attempted to kill Bendu, who taunted him, but failed because Bendu is a Force-Wielder and can't be destroyed by mortal weapons or crafts.\n\nThrawn then reappeared in ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore|Heroes of Mandalore]]'' where he viewed how The Duchess prototype via through hologram how it destroyed members of Clan Wren. Following the demonstration he ordered [[Tiber Saxon]] to capture Sabine Wren to upgrade the prototype.\n\nHe later bore witness to the demonstration of the TIE Defender Elite, before discovering that Sabine Wren and Ezra Bridger had infiltrated the TIE landing strip. They manage to escape with the Defender Elite, but after Sabine and Ezra shoot down the pursuing TIE Interceptors and disable the tracking beacon, Thrawn orders Governor Pryce to activate the Elite's kill-switch. He then sends out search parties to locate the Elite and find the Rebels as well. When a strike team of Rebel X-wings and Y-Wings appear to breach the Lothal Imperial blockade to attack the Imperial Armory Complex, Thrawn is easily prepared, taking out the entire squadron, and sending Rukh and other forces to find the stragglers who survived, resulting in the capture of Rebel captain Hera Syndulla, who is brought back for interrogation.\n\nLater on, as he is checking in with Pryce regarding Hera and her interrogation, he is summoned to Coruscant to speak with the Emperor regarding funding for the TIE Defender project, as word is the funding might be pulled to fund the [[Death Star]] construction instead. Thrawn leaves to have his meeting with the Emperor, but later receives word that the Lothal City fuel depot has been destroyed on Pryce's orders to stop the Rebels, who rescued Hera in the meantime, essentially putting the Imperial Armory Complex out of action and halting all progress on the TIE Defender. Thrawn is livid when he contacts Pryce to confront her on her incompetence, but when Pryce tries to argue that the Rebel Jedi Kanan Jarrus is dead, presenting his lightsaber as proof, Thrawn is in no mood to be happy about that as Pryce destroyed their entire fuel supply, compromising the TIE Defender project, and actually helping the Rebels instead. Warning her that he will deal with her when he returns to Lothal, he assigns Rukh to hunt the Rebels down, thinking that they will flounder without Kanan to lead them.\n\nLater, as he is returning to Lothal, Rukh contacts him to tell him that the Rebels ambushed his forces and took Governor Pryce hostage, intending to destroy the Imperial Complex in the capital city and with it, all Imperial forces on Lothal. Thrawn arrives sooner than the Lothal Rebels expected, and threatens to bombard the capital with his Star Destroyers unless Ezra surrenders to him. Ezra does turn himself in to Thrawn, but as Thrawn prepares to raze the capital city anyway, his attempts to do so are thwarted by the Rebels reactivating the capital's planetary shield, revealing Rukh being killed in the process as he's electrocuted to death in the shield generator, and Thrawn discovers the entire Imperial blockade wiped out by Purrgils, which also take down the Star Destroyers flanking his flagship, killing thousands of Imperial personnel under his command, before the Purrgils attack his flagship, grabbing him in their tentacles as they prepare to make the jump into hyperspace while dragging the ''Chimaera'' with them. Ezra remains to ensure Thrawn is taken with the Purrgils into lightspeed, and with that, Thrawn can do nothing but struggle as the Purrgils make the jump, and take the ''Chimaera'' with them. The episode itself leaves both Thrawn and Ezra's fates ambiguous, although Lucasfilm has confirmed that they both survived.\n\nFive years later, after the Battle of Endor and the death of Palpatine, [[Ahsoka Tano]] and Sabine Wren decide to go searching for Ezra to bring him home. They depart Lothal, knowing the likelihood that they will encounter Thrawn again.\n\n=== ''[[The Mandalorian]]'' ===\nAnother five years later, Thrawn is bent on remaining hidden. He sends the cruel magistrate Morgan Elsbeth to take over the city of Calodan on the planet Corvus, which attracts the attention of Ahsoka. Thrawn wants Ahsoka dead, but Elsbeth's troops fail to kill her. Following the arrival of Mandalorian [[Din Djarin]] and Jedi youngling [[Grogu]], Ahsoka duels and defeats Elsbeth, removes her from power, and demands for her to divulge Thrawn's location.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Thrawn originally appeared in ''Star Wars Legends'' after the ''original trilogy'' and was created by Timothy Zahn for his series of books known as ''The Thrawn Trilogy'' which include the following books, ''Heir to the Empire'' (1991), ''Dark Force Rising'' (1992) and ''The Last Command'' (1993). His popularity with the ''Star Wars'' fanbase sparked his introduction into the new ''Star Wars'' canon continuity. Zahn had approved of Thrawn's inclusion into ''Star Wars Rebels'' and wrote a book titled ''Thrawn'', which was then published in 2017 to expand upon his inclusion into the series and the overall new canon timeline. The novel eventually extended into a whole series of Thrawn novels.\n**Timothy Zahn, the author of ''The Thrawn Trilogy'', has also written several other Star Wars books outside of the trilogy itself, but have some reference to Thrawn or an appearance of him as well. Those include ''Specter of the Past'' (1997), ''Vision of the Future'' (1998), ''Fool's Bargain'' (February 1, 2004), ''Survivor's Quest'' (2004), ''Outbound Flight'' (2006), ''Allegiance'' (2007), ''Choices of One'' (2011), ''Scoundrels'' (January 2013), 2 graphic novels involving Mara Jade (another one of Zahn's creations who was first introduced in ''The Thrawn Trilogy''), a multitude of short stories. Because of these stories, Thrawn is considered to be a popular ''Star Wars Legends'' character.\n**It should be noted that when the ''The Thrawn Trilogy'' was released back in the early 1990's, these books caused a resurgence in the public's interest in the Star Wars franchise for the first time since the premiere of ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060204162725/http://www.starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/f20060131/index.html</ref>\n*Lars Mikkelsen, Thrawn's voice actor, is the brother of [[Mads Mikkelsen]], who played [[Galen Erso]] in ''[[Rogue One|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''.\n*Thrawn is the only Chiss to appear in the new ''Star Wars Canon'', with Thrawn himself bringing his species back into ''Canon''.\n*In ''Star Wars Legends'', Thrawn gains the rank of Grand Admiral after stopping a rogue Grand Admiral and taking his place; in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', he gains the rank when he stops an rebel insurgency by bombarding a planet, killing all of the rebels on the planet but along with most of the planet's population.\n*As established in the ''Star Wars: Aftermath'' trilogy, which covers events between ''The Return of the Jedi'' and ''The Force Awakens'', Thrawn's knowledge of the Unknown Regions inspired a contingency plan-eventually carried out by Rae Sloane-in which remnants of the Empire traveled into that region of space in order to rebuild, leading to the birth of the First Order.\n*In the fifth episode of the second season of ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', it was confirmed that Thrawn is still alive.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Wookieepedia}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Admirals]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
