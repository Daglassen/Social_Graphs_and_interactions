Urbosa duels one of them before knocking the Yiga down using the [[Perfect Guard]] and hitting him in the stomach with her Scimitar hilt. She places the Daybreaker Shield on her back before using Urbosa's Fury to electrocute the second Yiga as he jumps in attempt to attack her from behind.

Urbosa and the other Champions met their demise to Calamity Ganon's four incarnations of [[Malice]]. Urbosa was defeated by [[Thunderblight Ganon]].<ref>{{Cite|This formidable adversary was made by Ganon and brought me to a warrior's demise 100 years ago.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> After her death, Urbosa lives on in the afterlife as a spirit and is trapped within Naboris.

Oh, and also...
