He is a member of the Mandalorian Clan Saxon and the brother of [[Gar Saxon]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nLike his brother [[Gar Saxon]], Tiber had a ruthless lust for power and an obsession with dominance that makes him selfish and callous. He was also shown to be a coward who resorts to cowardly and dishonorable tactics to get what he wants. Like [[Thrawn]], he was also achievement-oriented to the point where he only cares about results.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nTiber makes his debut in ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore|Heroes of Mandalore]]''. It's revealed that after the death of his brother, Tiber became the new Imperial Governor of Mandalore.\u00a0\n\nHe first appears while directing Clan Saxon's forces and the Imperial Forces in the Mandalorian Civil War. When he receives a report his forces are being overwhelmed by the enemy, he unleashes The Duchess, a weapon created by Sabine Wren to neutralize Mandorian warriors by targeting their armor. He later shows the results to Grand Admiral Thrawn, who notes the range isn't what was promised. Thrawn tells him he needs Sabine Wren make it operate at it's full potential. When the Rebel Forces attack, he captures Sabine and makes her unleash it's full potential. However, when Tiber turns it on The Duchess does it's stuff to the Imperial Forces. Sabine then destroys it and causes a huge explosion. Tiber perish in the explosion.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like Ray Stevenson, the voice of Gar Saxon, and Kevin McKidd, Fenn Rau's voice actor, Tobias Menzies, Tiber's voice actor, also starred on HBO's ''Rome'' as Marcus Junius Brutus.\n*Tiber's statement \"I am the Empire!\" is a nod to Palpatine's statement \"I am the Senate!\".\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
