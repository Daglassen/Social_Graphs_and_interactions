She married [[Prince Edward]]'s father after his mother presumably died. After the father died, Narissa began fearing for the day that Edward would marry, since it would mean she would lose her throne forever. So she made his servant [[Nathaniel]] distract her stepson by making him hunt trolls every morning.\n\n===Development===\nQueen Narissa was created to be similar to three famous Disney Villains - [[The Evil Queen|Queen Grimhilde]], [[Maleficent]], and [[Lady Tremaine]]. She utilizes the Queen's hag disguise, takes on a dragon form similar to Maleficent, and has Lady Tremaine's role as an evil stepmother. Overall the villains all share the same basic role and personality.\n\n===Personality===\nNarissa was given the best and worst traits of [[the Evil Queen]], [[Lady Tremaine]], and [[Maleficent]]. She is beautiful, selfish, cruel, spiteful, vindictive, cunning, powerful, ruthless, and full of black magic.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nQueen Narissa is very knowledgeable in many different areas of dark magic, such as but not limited to shape-shifting, which she can do by reciting the spell \"Speciosus, formosus, praeclarus!\", electrokinesis, water communication, and scrying (which she not only can do through water but other forms of liquids such as soup and alcohol). She can also produce powerful sonic screams with her voice, which are capable of shattering glass. Furthermore, she would appear to be gifted in alchemy and deadly substances, much like the Evil Queen, as shown with her poisoned apples.\n\n==Role in the film==\nNarissa first appears, hoping that she will not see the day when her stepson Prince Edward finds a perfect bride, but he eventually falls in love with a girl named Giselle. Knowing that Edward will be crowned King upon his marriage and replace her as the monarch, Narissa vows to stop at nothing to destroy the girl. Hours before the wedding, she appears in a hag form and tricks Giselle into falling down a fountain that leads to New York City in the real world, thus keeping her stepson single and her keeping the throne.\n\nUpon learning that Edward has followed Giselle to New York, Narissa sends her devoted minion Nathaniel to kill Giselle with three poisoned apples. When Nathaniel fails with the first two apples, Narissa goes to New York to finish the job herself. She goes to the City\u2019s ball celebration disguised as a hag again and convinces Giselle to eat the remaining apple, telling her that one bite will erase her sorrowful memories of New York. Giselle eats the apple and collapses. Narissa reverts to her normal appearance and attempts to escape with the unconscious Giselle but is intercepted by Edward. Narissa insists that Giselle is fine, just fainted, but everyone ignores her. The fully-realized Nathaniel reveals Narissa\u2019s evil intentions, and Edward declares that she will lose her crown for this. When Edward\u2019s kiss fails to wake Giselle, Robert, a man who helped Giselle in New York City, kisses her, and it successfully lifts Narissa\u2019s curse just as the clock strikes twelve. Giselle admits that she knew Robert was her true love, and the party cheers.\n\nIn a rage, Narissa turns into a fire-breathing dragon, and the film\u2019s battle begins. Narissa captures Robert and takes him to the top of the Woolworth Building. Giselle fights Narissa to save him. Giselle and Robert seem doomed until Giselle\u2019s best chipmunk friend Pip comes; due to being overweight, he manages to break the spire that Narissa is standing on and causes her to drop Robert. Narissa then falls to an explosive death with only sparkly dust remaining from her while Giselle, Robert, and Pip stay safe on the top of the Woolworth Building.\n\nEventually, Edward returns to Andalasia alongside Robert\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e Nancy, where they get married and are crowned Andalasia\u2019s new monarchs.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Queen Narissa is the only Disney villain to date to have a stepson (Prince Edward).\n*She also shares a namesake with the former guardian villain of ''[[W.I.T.C.H.]]'' (a Disney/[[Jetix]] show).\n\n{{Enchanted}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Narissa}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Enchanted characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]\n[[Category:Stepparents]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Overtakers]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Sorceresses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
