Ralera is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ralera spends her daytimes sitting on a stool at the base of a tree, where she can watch over the windmills she and her husband, Rhodes, own. She has recently moved to Hateno Village from her hometown, Lurelin Village. Ralera is a newly wed who adores her husband and is more than willing to aid him in his work. While she enjoys the air of Hateno, she does mention that it is unlike the breeze she grew up with.
Ralera is a carefree woman who enjoys chatting with passersby and will happily talk about things with Link. He can ask her about Lurelin Village and she will describe it for him as a fishing community past the Bridge of Hylia, which she herself had to cross with her husband. She takes a moment to reflect on how her father is doing, as she has not returned to the village after being married.
Should Link ask what she is doing, Ralera explains how she watches the windmills for Rhodes's work during the day. She enjoys doing so, as she finds sitting there peaceful, and so is quite relaxed about the work.
Sitting beside her is a Blue Flame Pedestal, which Link can point out. Ralera can tell him that the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab director lights these lanterns with a Blue Flame, but admits that she does not know much more than that. However, she does wonder if the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab still has a director at all, as she has not seen them. She encourages Link to visit the lab himself.
At 9 o'clock in the evening, her shift at the windmills is over and she heads for home to get some sleep. While she rests, she sleep-talks about how Rhodes is currently watching over the windmills in her place.
According to her husband, Ralera was the one to suggest they go in shifts.
