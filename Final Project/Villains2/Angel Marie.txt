In the musical number \"[[Cabin Fever]],\" he dresses up like a [[Hawaii]]an dancer.\n\nHis graceful name belies his grotesque appearance. Like the person called before him, Big-Fat-Ugly-Bug-Face-Baby-Eating O'Brien, Angel's name does not match that of his appearance; in fact, it appears that the two character's names have been switched.\n\nHe later played one of [[The Flying Monkeys]] in ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'' (performed by [[John Kennedy]]), appeared in a [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Haunted_Holidays Haunted Holidays] sketch and appeared in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Virmup Virmup] video \"[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody Bohemian Rhapsody]\" (in a shot with Mo Frackle, [[Old Tom]] and a Purple [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Frackles Frackle]) performed by [[Bill Barretta]].<ref>[http://themuppetmindset.blogspot.com/2010/02/interview-with-muppeteer-bill-barretta.html The Muppet Mindset: Interview with Muppeteer Bill Barretta - Part 2]</ref>\n\nThe puppet also appeared in a background cameo in\u00a0''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''\u00a0in the songs\u00a0[[The Big House]]\u00a0(serving Kermit some fish) and\u00a0[[Together Again (Muppets song)|Together Again]]\u00a0(serving the leftovers to the Russian prisoners)\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nFile:Angel_marie_concept.jpg|Conceptual art for Angel Marie\nMuppetSnowWhite-Issue4-Cameos.jpg|Illustrated cameo in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_Snow_White Muppet Snow White]'' #4\nMuppets Encyclopedia mockup 01.jpg\nAngel-Marie.jpg\nAngel Marie in drag.png\nBohemianmonsters.jpg|Angel Marie in the Bohemian Rhapsody video\nMS3.jpg\nAngelMarie-UpLate.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marie, Angel}}\n\n{{The Muppets}}\n[[Category:The Muppets characters]]\n[[Category:Muppet Treasure Island characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Muppets Most Wanted characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Muppets' Wizard of Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
