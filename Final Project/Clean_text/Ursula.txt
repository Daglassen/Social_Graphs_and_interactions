Ursula based the sea witch character Hans Christian Andersen story The Little Mermaid the original story the sea witch neutral enabler but for Disney animated adaptation the character was modified into full fledged antagonist and plays larger role the overall story During pre production Ursula was not originally designed Cecaelia legendary hybrid human and octopus was thought that she would another species sea creatures such rockfish lion fish would have snake like appearance revealed The Disney Sketchbook The production team then saw documentary about octopi and decided that their multiple arms and imposing appearance would perfect for the character they were creating Ursula only drawn with six tentacles due the studio budget and difficulty coordinating eight tentacles though she has eight limbs you include her arms Pat Carroll has stated that this makes her squid though biologically she still resembles octopus far more than any other sea creature Moreover squid has ten tentacles not six Although unlike most Cecaelia Ursula very obese The character has been compared Madame Medusa from The Rescuers terms style dramatics and choice minions Pat Carroll Ursula voice actress envisioned the character part Shakespearean actress with all the flair flamboyance and theatricality and part used car salesman with touch con artist Carroll who contralto deliberately deepened her voice for the role During development Vanessa Ursula human alter ego story arc went through radical changes revealed Little Mermaid Original Script leaked script online Originally Vanessa method hypnotizing Eric was different instead suppressing his free will and eliminating his capability display emotion she let him have broader range emotion and gave him some free will The point this sort hypnosis was influence Eric Vanessa direction and accept her over Ariel his own emphasizing deception over the brute force from the final film After Vanessa hypnotizes Eric introduces Ariel her the morning the third day announcing that they will married sunset This vastly different from the final film where Ariel eavesdrops their announcement before running away never getting good idea who Vanessa until Scuttle tells her better conceal herself due her being close Ariel Vanessa wears scarf the original script way hide her nautilus necklace and not arouse suspicion from Ariel And when Ariel runs away Eric about run after her but Vanessa pulls him back and kisses him using Eric fake love for her way intimidate him The scene inside the cabin exactly the same the film but the wedding itself has noticeable differences the original Vanessa was actually eager marry Eric and was impatient about the wedding being done before sunset suggesting some ulterior motive aside from just taking Ariel the original script she also gets actually say unlike the final product Vanessa isn able kiss Eric again though the ceremony disrupted explosion off the side the ship and Scuttle small army shows and begins attack Vanessa She fights back the original version much like the film but quickly stops when she realizes she blowing her cover sweet innocent girl She then begs Eric protect her which does Since Scuttle can get close Vanessa intends reveal her true form Eric bringing the mirror from her cabin crashes into pole and the mirror breaks but Eric able see Vanessa for what she the reflection the water the sea creatures brought board the ship This breaks the illusion and rejects her for Ariel this point Vanessa voice returns sounding like Ursula presumably because the spell has been broken and Eric and Ariel are about embrace Much like the final movie the sun sets before they can kiss and Vanessa turns back into Ursula dragging Ariel back with her under the sea this ending Ariel does not get her voice back until the very end which changes the dynamic the scene entirely explanation was ever offered why this half the ending was changed separate note early storyboard concept art revealed that Vanessa and Eric would have originally been married the castle instead ship with Ariel lurking above observance This change may have been made add sense urgency for Ariel stop the wedding having take place somewhere else also may have been done create better transition between the wedding scene and the final battle underwater Vanessa role the film inspired the original Andersen tale that story after the prince has been rescued the mermaid found the beach princess whom believes have saved him Later after the mermaid becomes human she discovers that the prince will marrying the maiden the end the maiden marries the prince while the mermaid who chose not kill the prince despite the urging her sisters dies and ascends spiritual rebirth The maiden like the Sea Witch was also neutral character rather than villain the book the maiden does not speak and presented being sprightly and innocent She very much love with the prince though snuggling him while not being possessive him she did not object his friendship with the mermaid Vanessa u00e7ade based imitating this behavior while snickering behind others backs eliminating the presence anything innocent tone and nature Ursula was very dark with wicked sense humor After her banishment from Atlantica the sea witch established herself beacon hope for unfortunate merpeople allowing them strike deals and business propositions that would supposedly result their happiness should they successfully fulfill their end the bargain During such deals she presumably spoke grandmotherly tone her only concern was the satisfaction her customers just she did with Ariel This would have lulled her clients into false sense security making her schemes easier fall for She would have pressured her victims into accepting her offer portraying herself their last resort making their dreams come true especially her initial deal wasn appealing alone Also Ariel deal any indication Ursula would sadistically ensure her customers fail upholding their end the deal resulting their souls being kept forever her possession their bodies becoming permanent members her living garden polyps The motivation such practices are never exclusively revealed though could theorized she held general contempt for merfolk result her banishment However she reserved sense morality remorse for those she tormented Ariel case her intentions are purely use the young mermaid pawn obtain power over the seas separate note Ursula the only character seen eating the film when she ingests hapless shrimp during her opening scene Throughout the film Ursula driven vengeance and lust for power Her prolonged vendetta against King Triton fueled her desire usurp him revenge for her banishment from the palace She quietly spies the merfolk with the help her minions Flotsam and Jetsam biding her time until she eventually finds opportunity concoct scheme capable placing her power this course being Ariel falling love with Eric Ursula insatiable hunger for revenge and power finally culminate the film climax when she crowns herself ruler the seas her maniacal rage matched only her increased size Despite Ursula irredeemable traits she had softer side seen her relationship with Flotsam and Jetsam who Ursula lovingly referred her babies poopsies They are the only creatures she treats with any true affection despite barking them times when enraged The only remorse she ever displayed was after accidentally killing them with Triton trident immediately redirecting her anguish and rage toward Ariel for causing the first place the series however she does abuse her minions for failure times Ursula was classy not bit flamboyant and presents herself with confidence She had eye for high standards and decorum evidenced her belief that lurking doorways rude Though she was very obese she appeared suffer dysmorphia claiming wasted away practically nothing and starving Despite this she exhibited vanity regularly admiring herself and applying makeup and hair treatment Though she had power alter her appearance she chose her naturally curvaceous figure apparently content and even going far flaunt sultry manner Most her personal distaste derived from her demoted social status and lack power Though Ursula was highly intelligent and calculating she was extremely arrogant and egotistical the point underestimating her opponents For example when she used the trident transform herself into giant she disregarded Eric threat and did not consider that her size made her easy target She gleefully brought shipwrecks the surface inadvertently providing Eric the perfect means retaliate without realizing his strength and skill sailor the time her fatal mistake was realized was too late and she was easily impaled the broken bow Eric ship before she could react was these negative traits and mistakes that eventually led Ursula painful yet justified death Though ambiguous whether not Ursula knew she was evil she makes clear song Ariel that she aware her infamous reputation among the merfolk and appears agree with and embrace their assessment Some media such the Disney Villains book back this Ursula morbidly obese octopod classified cecaelia half human half octopus She has light lavender skin short white hair and her body from the waist down black with six tentacles dotted violet suckers The area around her eyes darker shade than the rest her face Her eyes are gray and she has mole near the right side her mouth She always seen wearing makeup particular she has aqua blue eye shadow deep red lipstick and red nails For jewelry she wears purple shell earrings and gold nautilus shell necklace Ursula alter ego Vanessa looks like what could considered mean girl version Disney Princess many respects she resembles Ariel with her striking beauty slim figure and long hair believed that this was deliberate match Eric hazy recollection the woman the beach However not difficult tell them apart Vanessa has olive skin dark brown hair black when wet that parted down the middle rather than brushed the side like Ariel higher cheekbones and violet eyes contrast Ariel bright blue which are accented highly arched eyebrows The latter feature gives Vanessa more mischievous expression especially when she pleased with herself Vanessa wears three outfits during her appearance screen the first sleeveless blue dress under deeper blue corset She wears this and black shoes the beach when hypnotizing Eric along with long black cape but seen without the cape Her second outfit simply the vanilla colored slip she wears under her wedding dress and black flats Her final outfit the aforementioned wedding dress long white affair with ruffles covering the front and split skirt revealing the slip underneath This dress has large puffs the sleeves much like Ariel She also wears long opaque white veil her head and pair white high heels With all three outfits she wears Ursula golden nautilus pendant which contains Ariel voice That until Scuttle destroys the end the movie Ursula magical abilities even without the Trident were very potent She was able concoct various potions create various spells including mass transfer implied during the song Poor Unfortunate Souls well physically altering people bodies evidenced her transforming Ariel into human well her own transformation into Vanessa and Ursula although the case Vanessa she needed Ariel voice disguise her own However she was incapable altering her reflection which eventually how her enemies got the drop her also implied that she was

what she did Ariel the alternate ending the movie She was also able implant voices into Flotsam and Jetsams heads relay orders them indicated her debut scene the movie She was also capable creating poisonous ink clouds which could absorb the energy the Trident and enhance Ursula power Her most dangerous ability however was her ability turn people into polyps should they fail fulfill their end the bargain via contracts having done multiple times under unspecified circumstances nearly did with Ariel and successfully did with Triton also implied that she absorbs their souls while transforming them into polyps making herself more powerful the process Likewise once the contract made indestructible even someone powerful Triton Presumably this arcane power way she does not end becoming polyp for failing fulfill her end the contract fact the only way completely stop contract short fulfilling via her death evidenced when the polyps turned back into merpeople the aftermath her death the
