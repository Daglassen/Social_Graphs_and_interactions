Detweiler|T.J.]] and [[Vince LaSalle|Vince]].\n\n==Appearance==\nLawson is tall and skinny. He wears a light blue short-sleeved shirt with two red and one white stripes, blue jeans, black and white sneakers, and a blue baseball cap worn with the visor in front over his brown hair. He also has freckles on his cheeks.\n\n==Personality==\nHis personality is akin to a bully jock. He is mean, rude, and competitive, and he is athletic, not to mention obnoxious and at times, ruthless. His blatant originality has been seen on more than one occasion, and he does not seem to know much other than sports.\n\nLawson apparently runs the 5th grade and is also the leader of a particular gang consisting of his five closest friends Chucko Kowalski, Cheay, Jocko, Buster, and Koreo. However, these five other 5th grade bullies are rarely seen altogether at once and often appear with Lawson as a group of 2-4. Lawson has appeared in many different episodes and can be referred to as a recurring nemesis for the Recess Gang, often causing trouble for them or insulting them. He was a major part of the 20 Minute Special episode \"Lawson and his Crew\" where he becomes jealous of T.J. and his crew getting all the glory for fixing the thing in the playground and so he ditches his own friends to form a new crew. His new crew consisted of the Snitch (Randall Weems), Swinger Girl (Referred to as Swinger Kid by Menlo in the episode), Greg Skeens the Graffiti Kid, Kurst the Worst and Menlo himself.\n\nEach member of Lawson's Crew members had the same job and position as and can be considered counterparts to each one of T.J.'s Crew: Randall being the Gus, Swinger Kid being the Spinelli, Skeens being the Vince, Kurst being the Mikey, Menlo being the Gretchen and Lawson himself being the ringleader, T.J.\n\nHis new gang all work well together throughout the episode, managing to beat the Recess Gang in solving all the problems of the playground before they can. Problems they solve include: Getting the Diggers back together, 2 of the 6 members performing ballet on stage with each other, giving free ice cream to everyone and saving the Library Kid.\n\n==Foreign Voice Actors==\n*'''Finnish:''' Juha Paananen\n*'''French:''' Serge Faliu\n*'''German:''' Robin Kahnmeyer\n*'''Japanese:''' Rica Matsumoto\n*'''Polish:''' Mariusz Oborski\n*'''Swedish:''' Calle Walderkrantz\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Erik von Detten, Lawson's voice actor, also voiced another bully from Disney: [[Sid Phillips]] from ''[[Toy Story]]''.\n*Lawson's appearance is T.J.'s appearance inverted. While T.J. is short and plump, Lawson is tall and lanky. Also, T.J. wears a red baseball hat facing the back, while Lawson wears a blue baseball hat facing the front. Both boys have brown hair and freckles, though T.J.'s hair is lighter.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Recess}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lawson, Earwin}}\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
