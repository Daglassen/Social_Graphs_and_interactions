Quite a coincidence, that you and I end up in the same joint? Oh and, this? That ain't on you. It's on our friend, [[Spider-Man]]. I gotta couple friends on the outside that'd love to meet him. You know, take some selfies, slit his throat, cram his head in the dryer. And a little birdie told me: you know who he is.\"<br>\"Gargan, you think if I knew who he was, he'd still be alive?\"|Scorpion and [[Vulture]]|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}    \n\n'''Scorpion''' (real name\u00a0'''Macdonald \"Mac\" Gargan''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. He is an adversary of the superhero [[Spider-Man]].\n\nScorpion was created by\u00a0[[Stan Lee]]\u00a0and Steve Ditko.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\nScorpion, here known as Max Gargan, traveled to [[New York City]]\u00a0to prevent [[Iron Fist]] from returning to K'un-Lun to compete in the Return of Shou-Lao, which would determine who would become king of K'un L'un. However, Danny Rand returned to K'un L'un with [[Spider-Man]] in tow. After a disguised Scorpion blinded Iron Fist to prevent him from competing, Iron Fist chose Spider-Man to fight in his place. During the Return of Shou-Lao, Scorpion utilized a number of dishonorable tricks to defeat Spider-Man, and placed the crown of K'un-Lun atop his head. However, the crown was a trap, and Scorpion was buried under a pile of gold coins, giving Spider-Man a clear path to the competition's real finish line, but Spider-Man chose to save him instead. Scorpion thanked his savior by racing ahead to the finish line anyway, but the Head Monk and Iron Fist appeared to reveal the Return of Shou-Lao was a test of character, and Spider-Man won by saving his opponent. Scorpion, furious that an outsider would be named king of K'un L'un, attacked Iron Fist, but was defeated. As punishment for his actions, the Elder Monk of K'un-Lun exiled Scorpion from his homeland. He later joined the Sinister Six in a new suit to get revenge on the webhead but was defeated.\n\n===''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''===\nMac Gargan is a professional criminal with a tattoo of a scorpion on his neck. He is potential buyer of [[Vulture (Marvel)|Adrian Toomes]], but thanks to [[Spider-Man]], he ends up being apprehended by the authorities during an exchange with Toomes and is sent to prison. In a post credit scene, he approaches Toomes in prison (who has recently been arrested) and mentions that him and some of his associates want revenge on Spider-Man and was informed Toomes knew Spider-Man's identity. Toomes answers that if he knew who Spider-Man was, he would already be dead.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x26 - Graduation Day, Part Two - Scorpion, Kraven the Hunter, Dock Ock, Lizard and Rhino.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x26 - Graduation Day, Part Two - Rhino, Kraven the Hunter, Dock Ock, Scorpion and Lizard.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x26 - Graduation Day, Part Two - Peter Parker.jpg\nCome Sinister Six.png\n1975D9A2-4F1D-4ACD-807E-84E041B4D910.jpeg\n1E918939-57DC-493B-AB7C-6046363A2C79.jpeg\n14755676-3659-4396-B9BC-258940127EB5.jpeg\nF9E1FDDA-8666-4568-971A-D366880B47C6.jpeg\n6FF3226A-B2EC-46F8-A739-0232B73B5E53.jpeg\nC367F2AA-859B-4553-9D67-CD25EB297D1A.jpeg\nScorpion is now Venom.png|Scorpion as [[Venom]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scorpion}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
