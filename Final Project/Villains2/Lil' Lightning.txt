He is [[Thunderbolt]]'s former sidekick and best friend.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nLil' Lightning is a\u00a0light orange Pembroke Welsh Corgi with a creamy peach belly and cream-colored paws.\n\nHe wears a blue leather collar with a license of a yellow lightning bolt.\n\n===Personality===\nInitially, Lightning is a\u00a0trusted ally and very sweet and\u00a0loyal.\u00a0He has always loved [[Thunderbolt]] and looked up to him as a brother-like figure.\n\nHowever,\u00a0he eventually became bitter toward Thunderbolt for acting selfish,\u00a0disrespectful, and rude\u00a0toward him and having had to tolerate it for a long time, as well as jealous of his fame and attention from ladies. He\u00a0later planned to get rid of Thunderbolt so he could take his place on the show. This is when he\u00a0began\u00a0to develop a\u00a0scheming mind behind his kindness.\n\nDespite his previous actions, Lightning still does show a bit of remorse and genuine feeling when Thunderbolt fakes his death towards the climax of the film.\n\nOverall, Lightning is not in any way a bad dog; he was just overcome with jealousy at Thunderbolt getting more attention and admiration than himself.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''===\nLil' Lightning starts off as the loyal sidekick of [[Thunderbolt]] in ''[[The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour]]''. When Thunderbolt makes a special appearance in London, Lil' Lightning enthusiastically appears when the director announces his cue. Three lady dogs appear and swoon, making Lightning think they are calling for him. He approaches, greeting them and politely saying it is nice to meet them. However, the ladies revolt, harshly rejecting Lightning and praising Thunderbolt, who tells Lightning the ladies are not interested in sidekicks, but rather the hero. This makes Lightning sulk in sadness and humiliation while Thunderbolt is enamored by the ladies.\n\nLater, Lightning runs into Thunderbolt's trailer, frantically telling him he overheard what the executives are planning for the next episode, which he says something horrible is going to happen. Lightning reveals that what happens in the episode is that Thunderbolt dies. Initially shocked, Thunderbolt begins to take a liking to it, stating he has always wanted a death scene. He asks Lightning how he will make his shocking return, to which Lightning responds he doesn't since he will remain dead and never return, not even for a reunion show or a cameo in the remake.\u00a0Thunderbolt is shocked by this as he realizes this means the executives are writing him out of the show and he panics. Lightning says they are going to replace Thunderbolt with a younger dog. Thunderbolt freaks out, telling Lightning he has to help him so he will not end up on the street. Lightning suggests Thunderbolt do something heroic in the real world to get his name in the papers.\n\nAfterward, the director is worried about Thunderbolt missing, but finds a picture of Lightning, so he decides to\u00a0re-write\u00a0the show slanted towards him.\u00a0Lightning peers through the window and chuckles, saying this is a whole new direction, revealing he has tricked the director. He then\u00a0taunts a Thunderbolt plush, asking what he thinks of it. He declares\u00a0he will finally be able to step out of his shadow as he has become tired of it, as well as being mistreated and shunned. After pushing the plush down to the floor, Lightning calls Thunderbolt an \"overrated, overacting ham\" and jumps down next to the plush. Lightning proclaims the show as ''The Lil' Lightning Adventure Hour'',\u00a0saying it has a nice ring and mockingly asks the Thunderbolt plush what he thinks and then chuckles sinisterly, relishing in his soon-to-be success.\n\nThat night, when news of Thunderbolt and [[Patch]] planning to rescue 98 [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppies]] from [[Cruella De Vil]] reaches Lightning, he realizes the deed will endanger his chance at fame. He worries that if Thunderbolt prevails, and the press witnessed it, he would never be rid of him and will remain in Thunderbolt's shadow for all time.\n\nLightning reaches Patch and Thunderbolt at Cruella's hideout, telling him he came as soon as he heard. He joins the two on their mission as they spy on [[Jasper and Horace]]. Patch suggests to Thunderbolt to use a stealth plan.\u00a0But Lightning tells Patch it will not be necessary as they could\u00a0openly attack instead. This results in Patch and Thunderbolt getting locked up along with the other puppies.\n\nWhen Patch tells Thunderbolt he knew he was faking, Lightning reveals himself, confirming Patch's claims. When Thunderbolt happily calls him, Lightning declares to him that he is not his\u00a0\"little buddy\". He also\u00a0reveals to Patch that Thunderbolt is a \"fraud\" and doesn't care about Patch or his family; he just wanted \"his name back in the papers.\" Lightning then told Thunderbolt that what he said about German Shepherd being replaced was a lie just to get him out of the picture. He then announces that he is going to take his place on the show, adding, \"''My'' show!\".\u00a0With his plan carried out, the traitorous corgi escapes while laughing evilly, leaving the others\u00a0locked away.\n\nAs soon as the television filming of ''The Lil' Lightning Show'' began, Lightning gets caught on the driving window of a double-decker bus ridden by Patch during his escape from Cruella and her henchmen. The bus soon drives into an alley, heading straight for\u00a0a\u00a0brick wall. Lightning screams and prepares himself for impact, but fortunately, Patch pulls the brakes, saving Lightning. The bus halts inches away from the wall; when Lightning opens his eyes, he passes out, sliding off the window.\n\nDuring the final battle, Lightning emerges from underneath the bus and watches in shock and horror as Cruella tries to kill Thunderbolt with a crowbar, only to hit Jasper and Horace\u00a0instead. Thunderbolt performs a dramatic death scene, earning Lightning's sympathy. Thunderbolt bids Lightning farewell\u00a0and collapses. This makes Lightning burst out in tears, saying, \"Good night, sweet prince,\" ultimately regretting his past actions. However, Thunderbolt drops the act and briefly licks Lightning's face, stunning and confusing him. Patch reverses the bus as he and Thunderbolt watch it roll toward Lightning. He immediately retreats, soon followed by Cruella and her henchmen. The bus sends them running out into the River Thames, defeating them.\n\nLater, the police arrive and arrest Jasper, Horace, and Lil' Lightning. Lightning tries\u00a0to convince the police dogs that he was \"helping\" Thunderbolt as they are a team, to no avail, with the dog in question remarking, \"Now who's the pathetic ham actor?\" Lightning is then sent to the pound.\u00a0His popularity is lost as well, with a newspaper heading in the credits mentioning his arrest and regarding him as \"the unkindest cut of all.\"\n\n==Trivia==\n* Lil' Lightning's personality and mannerisms are similar to his voice actor [[Jason Alexander]].\n* Lil' Lightning is not the true villain as when [[Thunderbolt]] faked his death, Lil' Lightning immediately burst into tears, believing him to be dead. He is also not in the least bit evil as he had never intended to kill [[Patch]], Thunderbolt, or anyone. Although he left them locked up in a cage.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
