"[[File:Salmoneus.png|thumb|250px]]\n'''King Salmoneus''' is a character and antagonist appearing in the\u00a0''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''\u00a0episode \"[[Hercules and the King of Thessaly]]\". He was voiced by [[Jeffrey Tambor]].\n\n==History==\nHe was king of Thessaly until he pretended to be [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]]\u00a0and was kicked out of the country by\u00a0the god of thunder\u00a0for his gall. After\u00a0weeping,\u00a0he states that it might be better if he were dead to which [[Pain and Panic]]\u00a0attempt to take him to the Underworld. When he says he is not dead, the imps must help him regain his throne from the new king [[Hercules]]\u00a0or he might let [[Hades]]\u00a0know. After many failed plans, Salmoneus takes his throne back but Pain and Panic, who are now transformed into a monstrous lion, had destroyed the palace and all of the city. In the end, the Thessalian people set up a democracy instead of a monarchy\u00a0which leaves Salmoneus powerless.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSalmaneus.jpg\nSalmoneusZeus.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Hercules}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Salmoneus, King}}\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
