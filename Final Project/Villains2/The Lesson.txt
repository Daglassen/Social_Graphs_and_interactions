"[[File:The Lesson.PNG|thumb|226x226px]]\n\n'''The Lesson''' was once a great hero who stopped the two\u00a0Bad Habits. When the two bad habits got loose again, The Lesson came to stop them, but the two bad habits explained to him that they had done nothing, and that people were just being lazy on their own. The Lesson then tried to rid people of their bad habits, but when they ignored him he tried to pound the lesson into them, literally. He is not really evil, he just wants to get people to get rid of their bad habits -- but he always takes things too far! His powers include flight, the ability to turn his hands into hammers, and warping reality such as putting people into video games and tv shows. He returned where his latest lesson has [[Yin (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yin]], [[Yang (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yang]], [[Lina]], [[Princess Melodia|Melodia]], and Dave trapped in a superhero-themed TV show.\n\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lesson, The}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
