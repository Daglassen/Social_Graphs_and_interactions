They fly using the leaves on their mantles and live on the small, barren rock islands scattered throughout the Sky. As Link flies his [[Loftwing]], Sky Octoroks will fire homing rocks at him. They can be defeated by flying close and boosting through them with a [[Spiral Charge]].\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\n{{Compendium/Extract|Sky Octorok}}\nSky Octoroks only appear in [[Master Mode]] included in DLC Pack 1, [[The Master Trials]], in {{BotW}}. They can be found all around [[Hyrule]] soaring through the skies next to bridges and [[Sheikah Tower]]s, or above bodies of water. Sky Octoroks appear in groups of three or four holding planks containing [[Treasure Chest]]s, and enemies.<ref>{{Cite web|quote= While exploring in Hard Mode, be on the lookout for planks floating in the sky.
