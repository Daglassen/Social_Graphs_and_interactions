If [[Link]] speaks to Maike during the day, she will attempt to say \"good morning\" in [[Hylian Language|Hylian]] and explains that they say ''sav'otta'' in {{Term|BotW|Gerudo (Language)|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Good...morning... Heh, that's how you say it where you're from, isn't it? Here, we say \"sav'otta.\"|Maike|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to her at night, she will try to say \"good evening\" in Hylian and explains that they say ''sav'sabba'' there.<ref>{{Cite|Good...evening... Heh, that's how you say it where you're from, isn't it? Here, we say \"sav'sabba.\"|Maike|BotW}}</ref> She also incorrectly says \"welcome\" in Hylian as \"well come\" and explains that they say ''vasaaq'' in {{Term|BotW|Gerudo (Language)}}.<ref>{{Cite|Well...come... Did I get that right? Isn't that how you say it where you're from? Here, we say \"vasaaq.\"|Maike|BotW}}</ref> Maike's little sister, [[Estan]], runs a butcher shop in [[Gerudo Town]].<ref name=\"Sister\"/> Maike tells Link that Estan knows the Hylian Language well, recommending that he stop by and meet her.<ref>{{Cite|She's traveled all over, so she knows your language pretty well. You should stop by and...|Maike|BotW}}</ref> However, Maike quickly realizes that as a man, Link would not be allowed to enter Gerudo Town and meet her.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, of course. You're a voe, so you won't even be able to get past the front gates...|Maike|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Maike while searching for the [[Vilia|man]] who discovered a way into Gerudo Town, he may ask her if she has seen a suspicious male merchant.<ref>{{Cite|You want to know if I've seen a suspicious-looking male merchant?|Maike|BotW}}</ref> Maike will be unable to recall someone of that description,<ref>{{Cite|Suspicious, huh... Hmmmm... Ahh, I dunno. It's hard to say. I spend all my time right here, and I don't know how I'd tell if someone was a merchant...|Maike|BotW}}</ref> suggesting that Link asks one of the [[Hylian]] merchants at the Bazaar instead.<ref>{{Cite|Anyway, there are Hylian merchants here, too. Why don't you go ask one of them?|Maike|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf {{Term|BotW|Link}} walks near her wearing the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Set|link}} she will remark that the outfit suits him.<ref>{{Cite|Those clothes suit you.|Maike|BotW}}</ref>\n\n===Wares and Pricing===\n{{ShopItem/h|desc=yes}}\n{{ShopItem|BotW|Roasted Bass|23|stock=20|typeimg=Icon|desc=A bass that's been cooked whole over an open flame.
