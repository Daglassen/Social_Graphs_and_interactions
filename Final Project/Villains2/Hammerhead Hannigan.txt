He is\u00a0[[Taurus Bulba]]'s lead henchman and often the target of\u00a0the latter's anger issues, which he tries to pin on his two subordinates, [[Hoof and Mouth]].\u00a0His gimmick is that he uses his head as a blunt object to headbutt his enemies. He appears to be based on the [[Marvel Comics]] villain of the same name, although a Three Stooges reference suggests he may also have been inspired by Shemp Howard's character named Frankie Hammerhead in \"The Invisible Woman.\" His choice of attack, headbutting, may also be based on actual male goat behavior as a show of aggression and dominance. Of Taurus' henchmen, Hammerhead is the only one who went on to appear in a third episode.\n\nHe was shown briefly in the episode \"In Like Blunt\" about to beat up [[Phineas Sharp]] when the list that Phineas was going to sell was replaced with a grocery list.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n474633-vlcsnap_00239_super.jpg|Hammerhead with [[Taurus Bulba]]\n474671-vlcsnap_00397_super.jpg\n474646-vlcsnap_00292_super.jpg\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-08h57m37s575.png\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h01m17s917.png\nEp01-004.png\nEp01-011.png\nEp01-012.png\nEp02-014.png|Hammerhead with Hoof, Mouth and Darkwing\nDarkwing Duck - 50 - In Like Blunt - YouTube2.jpg|Hammerhead in the episode \"[[In Like Blunt]]\"\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h11m50s759.png\n474670-vlcsnap 00389.jpg\n474687-vlcsnap 00467.jpg\n474635-vlcsnap 00241.jpg\n474678-vlcsnap 00436.jpg\n474645-vlcsnap_00287.jpg\n474853-vlcsnap_00685.jpg\n474854-vlcsnap_00686.jpg\n474856-vlcsnap 00699.jpg\nvlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h20m45s895.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h20m14s577.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h25m22s169.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h24m54s188.png\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h14m53s082.png\n474875-vlcsnap_00767.jpg\n474894-vlcsnap_00817.jpg\n474676-vlcsnap_00428.jpg\n474697-vlcsnap 00494.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h31m47s107.png|\"Grab onto something!\"\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h30m22s662.png|\"Not me, you lunkheads!\"\nDarkwing_Duck_-_102_-_Darkly_Dawns_the_Duck_part_2.jpg|Hammerhead's defeat\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hannigan, Hammerhead}}\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]"
