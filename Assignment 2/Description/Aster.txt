She is usually found running about in front of {{Term|BotW|The Great Ton Pu Inn|link}}, laughing to herself.<ref>{{Cite|Kya ha ha!|Aster|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Aster}} is a big fan of the {{Term|BotW|Bolson|link}} Dance and will ask {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} if he knows it.<ref>{{Cite|[Yes?] Have you seen this one? Ba ba ba, Bolson\u2026 {{small|Fu-WA! Fu-WA!}} SHAKEEEEEEN!|Aster|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Link}} can either recognize it and please the child,<ref>{{Cite|[I love that bit.] Of course you do. That means you have good taste.|Aster|BotW}}</ref> or admit that he does not know it and allow her to teach it to him.<ref>{{Cite|[Never seen it.] Kya ha ha! LAME! I\u2019ll do it again. Watch carefully this time! All right, I\u2019ll teach you, but you gotta pay attention, OK? Ba ba ba, Bolson\u2026 {{small|Fu-WA! Fu-WA!}} SHAKEEEEEEN! Easy as pie, right?|Aster|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf {{Term|BotW|Link}} speaks to her again later, he can ask about either {{Term|BotW|Bolson}} himself or the dance. {{Term|BotW|Aster}} will tell the hero that {{Term|BotW|Bolson}} is a carpenter and how he can find him behind the {{Term|BotW|East Wind|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|[Bolson?] Have you seen the carpenter behind the general store?|Aster|BotW}}</ref> Apparently, {{Term|BotW|Bolson}} is also a {{Term|BotW|Bolson Construction|link|display = luminary in his field}}, but Aster does not fully understand that title and instead tells Link to get Bolson to show him his dance.<ref>{{Cite| {{small|I actually heard...he\u2019s not a carpenter but a really famous luminary in his field... But I don't know what that means...}}|Aster|BotW}}</ref> She also says she heard he was a construction company, but she's not sure how that's possible.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|I actually heard...he's not a carpenter but a construction company... I don't really know how that's possible, though...}}|Aster|BotW}}</ref> In addition, Aster may share she heard that Bolson is a famous president or designer.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|I actually heard...he's not a carpenter but a really famous president!}}|Aster|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Small|I actually heard...he's not a carpenter but a really famous designer...}}|Aster|BotW}}</ref> Whatever she says, Aster will direct Link to Bolson so he can see the dance for himself.<ref>{{Cite|Whatever he is, I want you to get Bolson to show you his dance!|Aster|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAsking her about the dance will get her to show it to {{Term|BotW|Link}}.<ref>{{Cite|[Dance?] You still don\u2019t know the Bolson dance? How uncool! All right, I\u2019ll teach you, but you gotta pay attention, OK?|Aster|BotW}}</ref> Telling her to stop will upset Aster, and she will call him lame.<ref>{{Cite|[You can stop.] Whatever! You\u2019re lame.|Aster|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 o'clock, {{Term|BotW|Aster}} goes home to go to bed.<ref>{{Cite|I'm heading home. Time to hit the hay!|Aster|BotW}}</ref> She'll also remark that if she doesn't get home soon, she will get in trouble.<ref>{{Cite|I'll be in trouble if I don't get home soon.|Aster|BotW}}</ref> As she sleeps, she dreams about her absent mother.<ref>{{Cite|{{small|Mmm\u2026}}|Aster|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{small|Mama\u2026}}|Aster|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*When it rains, {{Term|BotW|Aster}} will run to the nearby outdoor kitchen and pretend to cook. She plays with a mound of material as though kneading it like dough.\n*Should {{Term|BotW|Link}} approach her with a {{Term|BotW|torch|link}} lit with {{Term|BotW|Blue Flame|link}}, she will excitedly follow him around.<ref>{{Cite|Whoa!
