They live in the realm of Jotunheim.\n\nThis version of the mythological Frost Giants was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===\nThe Frost Giants are mentioned by Thor as they exterminated the [[Malekith|Malekith the accursed]] and his fellow [[Dark Elves]].\n\nThe Frost Giants first appear laying siege on Asgard, led by [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], but they are stopped by [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] returning from his battle against the [[Wrecking Crew]] on Earth. After defeating the Frost Giants and Loki, Thor and [[Odin Borson|Odin]] get into an argument due to Thor being busy on Earth instead of protecting Asgard. They don't know that Loki was also behind the Wrecking Crew's attack as part of a manipulative scheme to cause a schism between Thor and Odin.\n\nWhen [[Avengers|the Avengers]] fight the [[Masters of Evil]] and destroy the Norn Stones, [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]] and [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] find themselves transported to Jotunheim. Hank faces the Frost Giants to protect the unconscious Jan, but they use the Casket of Ancient Winters against him. Luckily, the size-shifting heroes are saved by [[Sif]], Brunhilda and the valkyries.\n\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\nWhen Loki turns Thor into a frog, the Frost Giants are his henchmen, but they are defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and his team with new weapons given by Eitri, the Dwarf king.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Disney Infinity (series)|Disney Infinity]]''===\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFrost Giant USM.PNG\nDisney INFINITY Superheroes toy box.png\nAvenger Blackwidow 3.jpg\nAvenger Blackwidow 2.jpg\nWhat If...? - 1x07 - What If...
