"\n[[File:Bleak_Molly's_poem.jpg|thumb]]'''Bleak Molly''' is the only female member in the [[Goth Fish]] group in ''[[Fish Hooks]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nWhen [[Razor V. Doom|Razor]] gets [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] to join their group, they hold a meeting in the library. Razor said that when they read the poem, there will be no judgments, then told Bleak Molly to read her poem. Molly recites her poem in a very deep voice: \"Dear Rainbows, please hang up and try your call again, for I am busy.\" Razor breaks his promise to Molly and says that he has seen better poetry on a bubblegum wrapper, after which he scolds her for a blonde hair on her head, which embarrasses her so much that she runs away screaming. (\"[[The Dark Side of the Fish]]\")\n\n==Physical appearance==\nBleak Molly is a pink fish with black hair, partially dyed pink. She wears a black coat and skirt with a pink broken heart and a spiky necklace.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Doris Flores Gorgeous]]\" (First appearance) (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Funny Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo Gets a Ninja]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[The Dark Side of the Fish]]\"\n*\"[[Riding in Cars with Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Diary of a Lost Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish School Musical]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish Talent Show]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Hairanoid]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Merry Fishmas, Milo]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n\n==Background Information==\n*She is a natural blonde.\n*She is the only female in the Goth Fish group.\n*Her name is a pun on the Black Molly, a real kind of fish.
