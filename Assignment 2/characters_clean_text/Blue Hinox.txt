Blue Hinox are recurring Bosses in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Link's Awakening ===


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Blue Hinox are a stronger variation of the Red Hinox found in Breath of the Wild. Unlike regular Hinox, they wear wooden greaves, though they can easily be burned away with flame-based weaponry. As is the case with all Hinox, their vulnerable to damage to their eyes. When defeated, Blue Hinox drop Hinox Toenails, Hinox Teeth, Hinox Guts, and a variety of cooked seafood.
Several quests involve encounters with Blue Hinox. The Shrine Quest "The Three Giant Brothers" has three Hinox on Mount Taran guarding Ancient Orbs that must be used to unlock the Tawa Jinn Shrine. Of these Hinox, the Middle Kin, which can be found in Uten Marsh, is a Blue Hinox. The "Shrouded Shrine" quest similarly requires Link to obtain the Orb carried by a Blue Hinox in the Thyphlo Ruins, which is used to unlock the Ketoh Wawai Shrine that lies behind the Hinox itself. The "Stranded on Eventide" quest also requires Link to take an Ancient Orb from the Blue Hinox on Eventide Island, which is used to unlock the Korgu Chideh Shrine. After freeing Zora's Domain from Divine Beast Vah Ruta, Torfeau can grant the Side Quest "The Giant of Ralis Pond", which requires Link to defeat the Blue Hinox at Ralis Pond.
Link can receive the Medal of Honor: Hinox from Kilton by defeating all Hinox in Hyrule Kingdom. This can only be acquired after defeating Calamity Ganon and completing the "Destroy Ganon" Main Quest.
