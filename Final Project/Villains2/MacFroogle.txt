He is shown to ignore anyone who demands to get the lake back, such as Nessie protesting to get her lake back.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Ballad of Nessie]]''===\nMacFroogle is introduced as a tycoon developer who plans on building his own golf course in Scotland, leaving [[Nessie]] to search for a new home, to no avail. When Nessie finally breaks down in tears over her misfortune, crying for weeks on end, her tears grow into a huge lake known as \"Loch Ness\". He later appears during the credits, floating on his sign, crying over the destruction of his own golf course, due to Nessie\u2019s tears flooding over his golf course as well.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nMacFroogle.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
