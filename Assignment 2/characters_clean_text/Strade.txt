Strade is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Strade is a Goron who can be found in the Gerudo Desert. He is first found at the Kara Kara Bazaar, watching the sandstorm in the distance. Strade tells Link that sandstorms are common in the Gerudo Desert and that anyone who gets caught in one will get lost. He goes on to say that the sandstorm at the Great Cliffs is said to clear up for a few hours each day. Strade wants to visit the Gerudo Tower, but the sandstorm is in the way. He also wants to go to Gerudo Town, but has been told that it is too difficult to go there and is stuck at the Bazaar. Strade watches the sandstorm every minute of the day while awake. Because the sandstorm only clears up during the night between 9:00 PM and 4:00 AM when Strade sleeps, the Goron has never seen it die down. If Link wakes Strade up during the night, the Goron expresses a distaste for the cold nights of the Gerudo Desert.
After Link calms the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, Strade can be found sitting in Gerudo Town next to the Goron Lyndae. Strade is confused why he was allowed into Gerudo Town, implying that he is male.
