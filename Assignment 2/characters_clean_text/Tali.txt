== Biography ==
Tali is the Gerudo Sand-Seal Racing champion who is coached by Shabonne. She can be found with Shabonne at the Sand-Seal Rally in the Gerudo Desert. Tali never speaks while Link is talking to Shabonne. If Link speaks to Tali, Shabonne apologizes to Link because Tali is not in the mood for autographs. If Link asks what happened, Shabonne explains that the Sand Seal race course is unusable with the Divine Beast Vah Naboris stomping around. If Link asks who Tali is, Shabonne is in disbelief that Link does not know the Sand-Seal Racing champion and says that Tali could demonstrate her skills if it were not for the Divine Beast. 
When Link returns to the Sand-Seal Rally after calming Naboris, the Sand-Seal Race will be open again. Link can speak to Shabonne or Tali to begin the Shrine Quest, "The Undefeated Champ". Shabonne tells Link that if he can beat Tali's record of 1:30, he can have a trophy. The trophy that Shabonne refers to is the nearby Ancient Orb needed to reveal the Ancient Shrine, which has been passed down by ten thousand years of Sand-Seal Racing champions. Shabonne charges Link 50 Rupees to race against Tali's record.
When Link beats Tali's record, she will finally speak and congratulate Link by presenting him with the grand trophy. Tali explains the legend behind the trophy to Link, which tells that the chosen one will be granted a new power when the trophy is offered unto the pedestal. After encouraging Link to place the orb into the pedestal, the Raqa Zunzo Shrine rises from the ground and the Shrine Quest is completed.
