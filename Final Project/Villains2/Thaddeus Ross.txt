He is an adversary of the [[Hulk]] turned military fighter. First appearing in the [[Universal Studios]]/[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[2008]] film ''The Incredible Hulk'', he returns to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in several follow-ups. He also appears in the  ''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]'' film.\n\nThaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''The Incredible Hulk''====\nThaddeus Ross had approved of a project for Bruce Banner to make soldiers immune to gamma radiation. In actuality, the project was to create a new super soldier serum, which Ross never told Banner. Banner ended up transforming into the Hulk due to his experiments and Ross proceeded to hunt him down to reclaim him stating \"As far as I'm concerned that whole man's body is property of the U.S. army\".\n\nAfter his elite soldier, Emil Blosnky, transformed into the Abomination, Ross found himself switching allegiances and allied with Banner to defeat him.\n\n====''The Consultant''====\nUpon learning that the [[World Security Council]] sought to free the [[Abomination]], Sitwell summons Coulson to devise a plan to stop this. They needed someone so annoying and irritating that makes the General not release Blonsky, that someone was Tony Stark.\n\nWhile Ross was drinking in a bar, Tony arrives and says he needs to talk to him.\n\n====''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''====\nAfter the incident with the Hulk, he became Secretary of State of United States and approved the Sokovia Accords proposed by the [[United Nations]] after an incident in Lagos, Nigeria, in which many deaths occurred when [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] accidentally destroyed a building during a mission of the [[Avengers]].\n\nRoss goes to the Avengers facility to present the Sokovia Accords to the heroes. He shows them footage of the destruction and chaos caused by their interventions during missions. He then tells them if they refuse to sign the Accords, they will be forced to retire.\n\nAfter Bucky Barnes was accused of killing the King of Wakanda, Ross gives Tony Stark 24 hours to find and bring him in. Ross was also in charge of the Raft.\n\n====''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''====\nThaddeus Ross appears in an holographic video call as the Avengers reunite at their HQ. Seeing the fugitive Avengers reunited with the other Avengers, he orders James Rhodes to arrest everyone present, but Rhodes dismisses Ross, since Thanos' impeding invasion of Earth is the more pressing matter. He is one of the victims that disappears when Thanos erases half of the life in the universe.\n\n====''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''====\nHe is one of the victims that were resurrected by the [[Hulk]] in 2023. Thaddeus Ross appears and shows his respect in the crowd at Tony Stark's funeral.\n\n====''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]''====\nSince this movie takes place around 2017, during the time Natasha is a fugitive after the events of the Civil War, Thaddeus Ross tries to apprehend her, but fails.\n\n===Marvel Animated Universe===\n====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====\nAt some point during his military career, General Ross was charged with capturing or destroying the Hulk. When he learned that Hulk is near Las Vegas, he moved his Hulkbuster forces there. Ross was inside the Hulkbuster Command Vehicle monitoring the battle against the Hulk. Ross was enraged when two agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. interfered in his mission.\n\nHe recklessly fired the missile on the Hulk while being distracted by [[Hawkeye|two]] [[Black Widow|agents]] despite direct orders. The Hulk ultimately saved the two from the missile. Everyone in the scene was surprised including Ross. After Hulk also saved the shuttle from crashing, he was captured and taken to the Cube. Ross and his Hulkbuster Unit was ordered to stand down by [[Nick Fury]].\n\nRoss and the Hulkbuster Unit were in motion again when the Hulk left the Avengers. They almost captured him in Northern Canada but were stopped by Hawkeye and were forced to retreat.\n\nTo combat the Hulk, [[James Barnes|Winter Soldier]] injected a modified version of the Hulk's blood into Ross which turns him into the Red Hulk.\n\nHe then began a rampage which heavily damaged the Helicarrier, which attracted the Avengers and brawled with Hulk before leaving under Dell Rusk's orders. A decoy Ross was leading his Hulkbusters in order to protect his secret identity.\n\nRoss then locked Banner in a higly-secured base. But [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]] convinced the President to clear his name and give orders to reluctant Ross to let him go. Somehow, Ross have his own plans, he planted a device on Banner so he could control him which he causes the latter to go Hulk and on the rampage. Seeing as an opportunity to join the Avengers, he showed up as the Red Hulk and took out the Hulk. After the fight, Red Hulk went to Cap and asked him if he can join the Avengers. On TV, he spent a week helping people trying to prove to be a better Hulk while his decoy did his part pretending to hate the Red Hulk on the press conference. Outside the Avengers Mansion, Iron Man gave Red Hulk an Avengers ID Card as a sign of being a new member in an official membership coronation. Cap who wasn't present there and instead was watching the membership coronation on screen, asked [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] to get information about him but was interrupted when Red Hulk entered the room trying to convince him to accept him. After discovering Cap's intentions, Red Hulk have showed his teammates the footage of Cap in Banner's cell and made up a story that Cap's gonna free the Hulk. After they decided to stop Cap, Red Hulk then said \"Avengers...assemble.\"\n\nRed Hulk then led them to the Helicarrier and accused Cap for helping the Hulk not mentioning [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] who was helping him. The argument quickly led to a brawl between the Hulk and Red Hulk. His true intentions were revealed after Cap removed the device and its remote. Red Hulk was quickly apprehended by being caught in a self-replicating high-density nanite compound implanted in his ID Card Iron Man cooked up just in case if he goes rogue. Red Hulk then reverted back to Ross, which shocks everyone but enrages Hulk who was more than eager to put him out of his misery for good but hesitates thanks to Cap. Ross was then locked up in his prison cell while he still ranting mad about the Hulk.\n\n====''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''====\nAt the beginning of the series we get a glimpse of Ross as he used to be before becoming The Red Hulk he reluctantly joins forces with the Hulk sometime after his transformation.\n\nAfter [[Skaar]] arrived on Earth, Red Hulk took him down with a rocket and imprisoned him in an anti-gravity holding chamber. Skaar managed to escape, and Red Hulk took on [[Annihilus]]' bugs before being captured and sent to the [[Negative Zone]].\n\n====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====\nRed Hulk is paired up with Captain America and [[Iron Fist]] by the [[Collector]] to help [[Spider-Man]] in a 'Capture the Flag' game. Spider-Man uses Red Hulk's heating ability to defeat [[Sandman]], causing the [[Grandmaster]] to summon [[Blastaar]] and Ymir. While they make their way, Red Hulk attempts to thaw out Captain America after being frozen by Ymir only for Captain America to be removed from the game. During the fight at the docks, Red Hulk tries to take on Ymir only to be knocked down by Blastaar. Ymir then steps on Red Hulk, removing him from the game.\n\n====''[[Avengers Assemble]]''====\nRed Hulk was first seen shackled to the ground by the [[Squadron Supreme]].
