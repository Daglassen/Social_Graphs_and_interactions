He was an extremely bitter man with an absolute deep hatred toward all magical creatures, especially [[Dragons (Jake Long Universe)|dragons]], believing them to be freaks of nature.\n\nExtraordinarily ruthless, the Huntsman was obsessed with killing magical creatures and had no problems with killing any normal humans he would consider as \"traitors\" who got in the Huntsclan's way, or even allies with magical creatures, even going so far as to disposing of his own subordinates if they failed or betrayed the Huntsclan. Once he threatened a student with death in a stern warning never to betray the Huntsclan and is also shown forcing failing students to fight an imposing monster known as the \"[[Krakken (Atlantis: Milo's Return)|Krakken]]\".<ref>[[The Academy]]</ref>\n\nThe Huntsman's personality is normally menacing, callous, level-headed, and horrifically murderous, and he is seldom shown losing his temper or displaying strong emotions other than hatred.\n\nThe Huntsman has an intimidating stature. His fighting skills are superb; he has impressive agility and acrobatic ability, as well as nearly superhuman strength and durability, even able to punch through a brick wall, another time was barely phased by being slammed headfirst through a metal elevator door, and even yanked the elevator pulley out with his bare hands in a fit of rage. Nonetheless, he left most of the physical work to his apprentice, [[Huntsgirl]], and limited his role in a fight to firing energy blasts with his staff weapon.\n\nIronically, despite the Huntsman's generally serious behavior and performance, he was often defeated in comical fashion; such as being defeated by Jake's flaming flatulence. Another time, Jake went back in time and embarrassed the Huntsman in front of his peers.\n\nWhile the leader of the Huntsclan, it was discovered other members of the Huntsclan held \"Huntsmaster\" ranks similar to his own.\n\n==Character History==\nOne time, [[Jake Long|Jake]] traveled to the past of 1986, where he met a teenage Huntsman. As a teenager, the Huntsman was a Huntsclan apprentice with a scrawny physique and a high-pitched voice that earned him the derision of his Huntsclan peers. Because of Jake's time-travel, the Huntsman's first assignment was kidnapping [[Jonathan Long]] so the Huntsclan could force him to reveal the identity of a dragon known to be at their school, unknown to them to be [[Susan Long]], due to rumors he was dating one. The Huntsman attempted to slay Jake several times. Jake finally accidentally dropped him into a monster pit, where he was mauled by a vicious large beast. He barely got out. When the Huntsman emerged from the pit, the experience resulted him in being \"deformed\", and his voice had changed to his present, deep voice which made his peers fear him. This also resulted in his hatred for magical creatures in general, and dragons specifically, and he vowed to one day slay all dragons on the face of the Earth. Whatever his first assignment was in the original timeline remains unknown. \n\nMuch of the Huntsman's plans were eventually revealed as attempting to gather thirteen mystical [[The 13 Aztec Skulls|Aztec Crystal Skulls]] which had the power to destroy all magical beings if brought together with a ritual. In addition, he began to grow distrustful of his apprentice. Tension and mistrust developed between the Huntsman and his apprentice Rose, due to her having fallen in love with Jake and acting as a double agent against the Huntsclan.\n\nEarly on, Rose referred to the Huntsman as her \"uncle\" as she believed at the time they were related. However she later learned differently during an adventure in the dream realm; the Huntsman stole Rose from [[Rose's parents|her parents]] immediately after she was born after learning of her birthmark, raising her as his apprentice while leading her to believe her parents were dead. Eventually, the Huntsman found out about Rose's change of allegiances and revealed he knew the whereabouts of her parents, threatening to kill them if she did not bring him the three Aztec skulls held by Jake Long.\n\n===Demise===\nLater, the Huntsman managed to gather all thirteen Aztec skulls after a major battle in which Jake and his allies are defeated by the Huntsclan. The Huntsman started the ritual to use the skulls to wish for the destruction of all magical creatures, but Rose knocked him aside with a shot from her staff weapon. She then used the skulls to instead wish for the destruction of all Huntsclan, where they started to vanish into thin air. However, all which was left of the #4 threat to the magical world was his cape, and scattered Huntsclan bases around the world.\n\n==The Huntsman's Appearance==\nAt first, the Huntsman's face was never shown beyond glowing red eyes underneath a black hood; it was later changed in the second season. Eventually, after once again involved with their Academy activities, he wore a ninja face mask, his eyes clearly visible while dressed in a more military-like outfit. His helmet has a slightly wolf-like appearance.\n\nSomething terrible happened to him at some point in his past. Seen from the behind, the back of his head is shown as bald and slightly deformed, briefly revealed back of his head was mottled with burns with veins standing out as a mechanical arm lowered his helmet onto his head.\n\nThe Huntsman's face is finally seen without his masks after his helmet was destroyed when Jake slammed him through an elevator door. He was shown as a bald, but otherwise normal-looking human, with a large full-body dragon birthmark partially covering the left side of his face. It is unclear if this is a second mark from the one the palm of one of his hands, or a continuation of the same marking. Since the American Dragon in dragon-form is obviously a fledgling, the Huntsman stood taller than he whenever they fought.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy between his true appearance and what was revealed of the back of his head may be attributed to Jake's time-travel stint altering something in the past.\n\n==Skills==\nThe Huntsman was a highly skilled hunter strong enough to take down a full-grown dragon with a little help; being able to hold his own against Jake and the strongest Magical Creatures. He was skilled in almost every single weapon, especially of Huntsclan technology.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Huntsmen's appearance was likely changed due to the exaggeration of it, ''his red eyes for example''. As his character is intended to be a hateful human being.\n*The scene where the Huntsman's burnt head is covered with a helmet lowered by a mechanical arm is an homage to a similar scene in ''[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back The Empire Strikes Back]'', where the back of [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker Darth Vader]'s head is likewise briefly revealed.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Huntsman}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Ninjas]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
