They only strike during the winter and manage to escape without being seen (their photo on the wanted posters is so blurry due to them moving so fast).\n\n==Background==\nSheriff Callie first gets word of the bandits' thievery at the town of Junctionville. When she investigates, she finds that everything silver has already been taken\u2014and the only things left behind are tracks left by their ice skates. Callie follows the trail back to [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] and deduces they will be after the trophy for the Silver Skates Ice Contest. She spots Sneaky and Speedy in the audience, and when they catch sight of her, they split. They nab the Silver Skates trophy, and also grab Callie's ice skates so she can't pursue them on the slippery ice. But Abigail Crane is still wearing her skates, and goes to catch up with [[Deputy Peck]], who then notices Sneaky and Speedy with the trophy. Abigail and Peck decide to pair up to stop the bandits, and corner them by using the Quadruple Lasso Loop. They skate a figure eight around the bandits so fast that they end up cutting the surrounding ice, trapping the brothers on a pair of ice floes. Callie then lassoes the Silverado Brothers and then puts them \"on ice\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBlurred Silverado bros poster.jpg|The blurred image on the wanted poster.\nSilverado bros spot Callie.jpg\nSilverado bros gotta split.jpg\nSilverado Bros interrupt the show.jpg\nSwift Silverado bros.jpg\nSilverado bro trophy swipe.jpg|The brothers steal the trophy.\nSilverado bro skate swipe.jpg\nSilverado Bros getaway.jpg\nSilverado bros skate.jpg\nSilverado bros skate 02.jpg\nSilverado Bros getaway 02.jpg\nSilverado bros skate 03.jpg\nSilverado bros skate 04.jpg\nSilverado Bros getaway 03.jpg\nHalt Silverado Bros.jpg\nSilverado bros cornered.jpg\nFigure 8 ice floes.jpg\nSilverado bros trapped.jpg\nSilverado bros lassoed.jpg\nSneaky and Speedy hang up your skates.jpg\nSilverado bros defeat.jpg|The defeat of Sneaky and Speedy Silverado.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mustelids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Weasels]]"
