Anderson''' is the assistant supervisor of MIFT in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]\u2022[[Pixar]] animated series, ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.\n== Background ==\n\n=== Personality ===\nDuncan is an ambitious monster who desires to be the head of MIFT. Much like [[Randall Boggs]], he is not above using underhanded or conniving tactics to achieve his goal. Unlike Randall, Duncan has redeeming traits and morals and actually gets along with his co-workers most of the time.\n\n=== Physical appearance ===\nDuncan is an olive green monster with four eyes. Strangely, Duncan's eyestalks are all different sizes in height. Duncan has multiple characteristics of a dragon such as webbed wings, long, skinny fingers which resemble claws, and dragon-like feet, but has a different body shape than a dragon.  \n\nHe used to have a pencil mustache, as seen in \"[[The Vending Machine]]\". He likely shaved it sometime after his employment photo.  \n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nDuncan promo.jpg\nMonsters at work cast.jpeg\nMonsters at work poster 2021.jpg\nMonsters at Work poster.jpg\nFile:Duncan poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Monsters, Inc.}}\n[[pt-br:Duncan P.
