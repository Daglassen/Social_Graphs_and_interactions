''Nocturnal Poem''), is Rank IX within [[Organization XIII]]. He controls water, and uses his weapon, the sitar, as a musical instrument to make water fight for him in battle. He commands the [http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Dancer Dancer] Nobodies.\n\n==Appearance==\nDemyx wears a black cloak similar in style to Xigbar's, with somewhat closer-fitting sleeves and pointed shoulder pads, though Demyx's shoulder pads are more noticeable than Xigbar's. His black gloves and boots are normal. He has cyan eyes and dirty-blond hair, the latter of which is quite distinctive. Demyx's hair has an odd mullet-like style, and he has several individual bangs that fall over his face. He is rather youthful in appearance when compared to most of the other members. Demyx is also somewhat similar to Zell Dincht from Final Fantasy VIII.\n\n==Personality==\nDemyx, unlike the other Organization members, has a very casual, cowardly, and lazy personality\u2014though this is simply an act since Nobodies are free of all emotion and thus cannot feel fear. He runs from many encounters, including ones with Hades and Sora; and in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, he states that he finds Larxene quite frightening and also refuses to go searching for a giant Heartless alone. Along with Xigbar, Axel, and Larxene, Demyx is portrayed as one of the more comical members of the Organization, although unlike the other three who have that role due to their sarcasm and wisecracks, Demyx has this role because of his laziness.\n\nWith his laid-back personality and despite his often sitting around, Demyx seems to be on good terms with both Axel and Xigbar, calling Xigbar \"Xiggy\" and is often shown talking to him in the Grey Area. And though Axel and Roxas talk about him behind his back, Axel did defend him after Roxas comments that Demyx doesn't do anything, Axel stating that Demyx specializes in recon.\n\nDemyx seems to dislike working as much as he dislikes fighting; he even goes as far as manipulating Roxas, dumping his missions on the younger Nobody and going off to have fun. He complains about how he \"isn't cut out for combat\" and even considers sweat \"gross\". Often, he wishes that Xemnas wouldn't make him fight and says that he'd prefer to stay at The Castle That Never Was or at least be given a recon mission. Demyx seems to dislike Larxene, calling her a witch.\n\nThe feeling is apparently mutual as she has referred to him as lazy and useless. When news gets back from Castle Oblivion, he seems to be glad that she has died, showing that even he can be a bit cruel and crass without a heart. He also seems to dislike Sa\u00efx, calling him \"X-face\" in one of his Secret Reports, saying that Sa\u00efx constantly barks at him to get to work. However, he does show some care toward Xion compared to the other members who have no care for her at all, showing that he may be a bit kinder than them, although he thought it was \"intense\" when he found out that Xion was a \"puppet\".\n\nDemyx is much less serious and more carefree than the other Organization members, as well as selfish, and seems to take his task of pursuing Sora lightly. He doesn't hesitate to read his orders aloud off of cue cards in front of Sora nor does he hesitate to complain about his distaste for fighting. His cries in battle after being hit are also more characteristic of \"yelps\" than those of the other members, and are exclamations rather than reactions. In his final battle against Sora, however, his true nature as an emotionless entity is revealed, proving that his light attitude is a farce. Yet when he is defeated, he screams in agony and defeat, holding his head, and whimpers as he fades back into darkness. This may indicate that he did not fully reject his fake emotions, but, overall, he seems to have come to terms with his lack of emotions.\n\n==Abilities==\n{{Quote|Dance water, dance!|Demyx}}\nDemyx is portrayed as being weak, cowardly, and lazy, but proves to be no pushover in the battle with Sora. Most players have trouble defeating him due to his ability to summon water clones in a time limit to defeat all of them. Demyx, being a musician, uses music to control the water around him and to summon \"water forms\", objects shaped out of water into musical instruments or copies of himself, which move about the battle area to hit Sora, forcing him to defeat the forms in a certain amount of time to avoid an automatic loss. He can also summon violent geysers that erupt from the ground, forming strong streams of water which damage Sora and throw him into the air. His sitar is rarely used as a weapon, but most often used to play his music instead. However, Demyx does use one move using his Sitar as a weapon, but it does little damage to Sora. Demyx does little fighting by himself, instead relying on his control of water to make it fight for him.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Demyx has a Limit Break called Wave Gigs. During Wave Gigs, the player must press and time the attack button in specific \"beats\" as Demyx jams out on his sitar, summoning up large pillars of water to rise and strike enemies. The more efficiently the button inputs are performed, the faster and more plentiful the attack will be. Enemies that are hit by the pillars take water damage. Meanwhile, Demyx's movement speed is reduced to a slow march, allowing him to slowly advance on an enemy as he attacks, but not much else. His falling is also slowed.\n\nDuring Demyx's Final Limit, Demyx releases a large ball of water while jamming out on his sitar. The ball creates a watery explosion that knocks enemies back and deals water damage.\n\n===Weapons===\nDemyx is very open about his dislike of fighting, and prefers music instead. So, he carries an enormous Sitar, named '''Arpeggio''', a stringed Indian instrument similar to a lute or guitar, into battle. The Sitar itself is shaped like the Nobody insignia, in varying shades of blue.\n\nWith it, he can cause water to take the form of people and musical notes, making them \"dance\" to his music. Although not very useful in battle itself, it can cause some damage if swung at an enemy. He mostly uses its strings to control water and make it fight for him.\n\n<center>\n\n<gallery bordercolor = transparent>\nArpeggio KHII.png|Demyx's trademark Arpeggio\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Story==\n===Kingdom Hearts Novels===\nIn his own room at an unknown time, Demyx was fixing his hair in front of the mirror, something he did from when he was a human made him do it. Finishing setting his hair, Demyx picked up the sitar and strummed it. He plays and plays, but he was interrupted by [[Xaldin]], who told him to keep it down because he wanted to sleep.\n\nAnnoyed, Xaldin questioned why Demyx clings to his human memories, but he didn't reply. Xaldin told him that [[Nobodies]] need to sleep because a terrible force is moving this world and they need rest to store up power. Demyx did not reply once again as Xaldin left the room, displeased.\n\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]''===\nDemyx plays a slightly larger role in ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', present when [[Xion]] joined the Organization. Often teased behind his back by Axel and Roxas whilst they eat sea-salt ice cream at the Station Plaza after missions, they quote how he doesn't have talent, would be \"upset\" if he lost his sitar, along with many other things. Demyx is the first to mention the annihilation of Organization members that took place at [[Castle Oblivion]], accompany Roxas on several missions including one to the Olympus Coliseum where they take down a [http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Flare_Note Flare Note], and one to [http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Halloween_Town Halloween Town] where they tackle a [http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Dual_Blade Dual Blade]. Demyx enjoys picking on Xion with [[Xigbar]], seen playing his sitar on one of the couches in the Grey Room before many of Roxas's missions. In the manga adaption, in one of the early chapters, he is also seen playing a prank on Axel, where he puts a farting pillow on Axel's seat. When Roxas approaches Demyx, he willingly admits that he \"isn't cut out for combat\" and would rather perform recon.\n\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''===\nDemyx appears in [[Hollow Bastion]] with all of the other Organization members, but he does not contact Sora. However, you can hear Demyx's higher-pitched, nervous laugh in the background.\n\nDemyx's role in the Organization's plans is minor. He is sent after Sora on suggestion by Xigbar to find him and \"''liberate his true disposition''\", that is, to keep Sora on the path Organization XIII wish him to take. He also contacts [[Hades]], but no deal was made and Demyx promptly flees, saying \"''Run, run away!''\", passing by Sora and co. and leaving them puzzled at his outburst. Later, Demyx steals the Olympus Stone, and soon encounters Sora within the [[Underworld]] once more. Although Sora doesn't understand the meaning of Demyx's objectives, nor why Demyx calls him [[Roxas]], Demyx is unable to fulfill them and took the next ordered step, which is to attack Sora. Demyx at first only summons \"forms\" of water - water shaped into himself and musical notes, which then attacked [[Sora]], [[Goofy]] and [[Donald Duck|Donald]] - which he controlled with his sitar. He is unsuccessful in defeating Sora with his water forms, however, and escapes instead of continuing the fight.\n\nDemyx confronts Sora later in Hollow Bastion during the Battle of the 1000 Heartless, again greeting Sora in a rather friendly manner. However, Sora and his companions' response is hostile, even claiming that Demyx is unable to fight. Demyx still maintains his personality despite the insult, with only a \"''You shouldn't judge anyone by appearance''\" in a slightly deeper tone. But when Sora and co. claim that the Nobodies do not have hearts, Demyx's normal carefree air vanishes, and he silences them with a much darker tone and attacks the \"traitor\" again with all his strength. In the end, however, Demyx is defeated again and fatally wounded. After lamenting his loss, he fades into darkness, the first Organization XIII member to do so in ''Kingdom Hearts II''.\n\n==Secret Reports==\n===Day 97: Sooo Bored===\n''Author: '''Demyx'''''\n\n''Every day it's work, work, work. I'm dead bored, and I'd kill for some vacay. A Nobody needs his rest, am I right? And when I get it, it's gonna be nothing but me and my sitar. Sigh...''\n\n===Day 153: This Is Gonna Be a Hit===\n''Author: '''Demyx'''''\n\n''I've got me a new hit single!

I mean, stop and think about skill sets when you divide up the labor already!''\n\n==Trivia==\n* His name is ''finally'' spoken in a cutscene with the release of ''Kingdom Hearts 1.5''.\n* Prior to this, some fans wondered if the \"e\" in his name was pronounced as the letter or not.\n* His name is possibly a joke on the word \"remix\", which is rather fitting considering his love of music.\n\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deymx}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts Bosses]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
