During the breakdown, he attacks [[Iron Man]] alongside Blizzard and Whiplash.\n\nHe is later recruited by the Masters of Evil at some unknown point after [[Wonder Man]] and before [[Abomination]]. He helped the other members of the Masters of Evil take over Avengers Mansion and capture every [[Avengers|Avenger]] except for [[Black Panther]], [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]], and [[Hawkeye]]. Zemo promised him he could kill Iron Man when everything had succeeded. Impatient, Dynamo blocked Zemo's path and asked him when and Zemo's answer was \"When I say so.\" Dynamo agreed and stepped aside. He was later defeated by [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] and Black Panther, though they managed to flee.\n\nWhen the Masters of Evil guarded the Norn Stones, Crimson Dynamo faced [[Captain America]]. Dynamo had the upper hand but was scared by some spirits from Hela's realm. When Zemo went to Avengers Mansion to ask for help to The Avengers, he reveals that he sent Crimson Dynamo to distract Amora. Iron Man and Hawkeye knowing that would be the end of the Crimson Dinamo, then they were to help him. After being saved by the Avengers, he arrives at the mansion to confront Enchantress again. When the last Norne Stone was destroyed by [[Wonder Man]], he was knocked out and sent to the Prison 42 as the rest of his team.\n\n===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===\nHe is shown as a member of the Winter Guard and using his Ivan Vanko alias. While working for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, and Hulk pursue Crimson Dynamo when he has gotten the key to a specific power source. Crimson Dynamo had an obstacle along the way in the form of Power Princess. The Avengers got involved in the battle which ended with Crimson Dynamo falling into the river. Luckily for Captain America, Black Widow was able to place a tracer on Crimson Dynamo. When they find the tracer near some mountains, they are attacked by Crimson Dynamo where he causes an avalanche. Upon defeating Crimson Dynamo off-screen, Hulk used parts of Crimson Dynamo's armor to carry his teammates' bodies into a Russian facility to meet the Winter Guard so that they can use a key to get to open a container holding a specific power source. When a near-armorless Crimson Dynamo caught up, Captain America's group fought Crimson Dynamo and the Winter Guard until the facility starts to destabilize. Both sides had to work together in order to keep the fragments of the facility from harming the village below. With Falcon's help, Crimson Dynamo freed the power source who turned out to be the Russian Radioactive Man as he dissolves the facility.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes''===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nAbomination- Earth Mightiest Heroes04.jpg\nMastersofevil.png\nAvengersemhtvspot3.png\nTumblr_mjg0a9flQO1rh9jdmo6_1280.png\nCrimsonDynamo-ActsOfVengeance.png\nCrimsonDynamo_EMH.jpg\n36_ep_29.png\nCrimson_Dynamo_A-EMH.png\nCrimson Dynamo IMIB.png\nCrimson Dynamo is stopped.png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Avengers Assemble''===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nCrimson Dynamo AA.png\nCrimson Dynamo Unarmored AA.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno3_1280.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno4_1280.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno5_1280.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno6_1280.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno7_1280.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno8_1280.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno9_1280.png\ntumblr_noctnikW8W1rl14rno10_1280.png\nWinter Guard AA.png\nWinter Guard AA 3.png\nWinter Guard AA 2.png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers''===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nCrimsonDynamo-DWA.jpg|In ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''\nCrimson Dynamo MDWTA Chart.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Video Games===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nCrimson_Dynamo-iOS.png|Crimson Dynamo in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''\nCrimson_Dynamo_Avengers_Aliance_2_Render.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{MAUWiki|Crimson Dynamo (Yost Universe)}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Agent Carter characters]]\n[[Category:Iron Man characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
