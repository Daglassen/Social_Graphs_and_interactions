Celebrity became so annoying that Shelton broke up with her. Even with that she engaged to never let him go causing him to lose his glasses making him a \"complete hottie\", which was not her mood.\n\nShe returned in \"[[Hollywoodn't]]\" to get revenge on the young nerd by making a movie to dehumanize him. She ended up casting [[Todd Daring|Todd]] in wishes to pursue him. In the end, Todd turned her plan around and helped his friend. She instead made a movie to make fun of Todd.
