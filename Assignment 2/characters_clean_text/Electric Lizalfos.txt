Electric Lizalfos are recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Electric Lizalfos are one of the elemental varieties of Lizalfos. They emit strong electrical currents from their bodies, therefore, they can create arcs of electricity which can cause Link to drop his weapons. Striking their horns with an Arrow causes an electric discharge. Like all Lizalfos, Electric Lizalfos will not attack Link if he is wearing the Lizalfos Mask.
