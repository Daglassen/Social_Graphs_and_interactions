Blue-Maned Lynels are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===
In Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Blue-Maned Lynels have 3000HP, and can be found carrying the Mighty Lynel Sword, Mighty Lynel Spear, or Mighty Lynel Crusher. Additionally, Blue-Maned Lynels always carry a Mighty Lynel Bow. When defeated, Blue-Maned Lynels will drop either Ice Arrows, Fire Arrows, or Shock Arrows. Depending on game progression (which affects the strength of enemies you encounter, as well as the weapons they carry), Blue-Maned Lynels will appear in different places across Hyrule.

Blue-Maned Lynel are the blue-colored variant of the red-colored Lynels. They have been in Hyrule Kingdom since ancient times. Like other Lynels, they will often refrain from attacking for a short period of time after spotting Link, instead opting to stare down its opponent. Being a higher tier variant from red-colored Lynels, they carry "Mighty" set of Lynel Gear, such as a Mighty Lynel Sword, Mighty Lynel Shield, Mighty Lynel Bow, Mighty Lynel Spear, and a Mighty Lynel Crusher. In Master Mode, they carry the weaker Lynel Gear set.
