She is the daughter of [[Captain Hook]]\u00a0and the younger sister of\u00a0[[Harry Hook]] and Harriet Hook.\n\n==Role in the film==\nCJ appears in the animated series as [[Freddie Facilier|Freddie's]] best friend and partner-in-crime on the [[Isle of the Lost]]. In her first four appearances, she is only slightly seen in the shadows, peeking from behind curtains and reaching her hand out from under a table, behind a chair and kicking. After Freddie fulfilled her end of the bargain and helped her escape the island, she betrayed their arrangement by treating her as her minion instead of a partner. During the Neon Lights Ball, she sabotages the dance to rally the rest of the Villain Kids in a plot against\u00a0Auradon, believing the villain children are destined to be better villains than their parents. When the VKs refuse to join her cause, CJ absconds on a magic carpet she stole from [[Jay (Descendants)|Jay]] and [[Carlos De Vil|Carlos]], though plots her return.\n\nCJ reappears in \"[[Options Are Shrinking]]\" with [[Zevon]], helping him with his scheme to take over Auradon.\n\nIn \"[[Celebration (Descendants: Wicked World)|Celebration]]\", CJ seemingly shows up uninvited and looked as if she was going to ruin the Jewel-bilee. Instead, she encourages the VKs and AKs to get the show going, indicating that she might have decided to take a break from her evil-doing for the time being. \u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the ''[[The Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel|Isle of the Lost novel]]'' there is a character known as \"Harriet\" who is also the daughter of Captain Hook. In ''[[Descendants 2]]'' there is a character known as [[Harry Hook]] who is the son of Captain Hook. This was clarified in ''[[Rise of the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel|Rise of the Isle of the Lost]]'' that all three are siblings, with Harriet as the oldest, then Harry, and finally CJ being the youngest.\n*CJ shares the same initials as her father's full name \"Captain James Hook\".\n**Her full name, Calista Jane Hook, was revealed in ''Rise of the Isle of the Lost''.\n*She is the fourth new character to appear in ''Descendants: Wicked World''.\n*CJ was first introduced at the [[2016]] Toy Fair, announced by the Hasbro toy company.\n*The face patterns on CJ's tights resemble the map of [[Neverland]] in ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''.\n*In the ''[[Escape from the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel]]'', it is revealed that CJ was sent back to the Isle. Though she appears to not be bitter about it since she encouraged Harriet to go to the presentation about [[Auradon]] in the hopes that she would get picked.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nLamp-Sweet-Lamp-28.png|CJ behind the curtains\nJane's Mascot Outfit.png|CJ walking by in Jane's mascot uniform\nNeon-Lights-Out-26.png\nNeon-Lights-Out-38.png\nNeon-Lights-Out-40.png\nNeon-Lights-Out-41.png|\"I'm hooked.\"\nNeon-Lights-Out-43.png\nHooked-On-Ben-2.png\nHooked-On-Ben-4.png\nHooked-On-Ben-6.png|\"Wave hi, Benny!\"\nHooked-On-Ben-10.png|CJ laughing\nHooked-On-Ben-14.png\nHooked-On-Ben-16.png\nHooked-On-Ben-23.png\nHooked-On-Ben-26.png\nHooked-On-Ben-31.png\nHooked-On-Ben-33.png\nHooked-On-Ben-39.png\nOptions-Are-Shrinking-13.png\nOptions-Are-Shrinking-14.png\nOptions-Are-Shrinking-16.png\nOptions-Are-Shrinking-25.png\nCelebration-15.png|\"On with the show!\"\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise and Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"medium\">\nDescendants Wicked World - CJ Hook.jpg\nDescendants Wicked world Artwork - CJ.jpg|''Descendants: Wicked World'' model sheet\nSchool of Secrets - CJ's Treasure Chase.png\nCJ Hook Doll 1.jpg\nCJ Hook Doll 2.jpg\nCJ Hook costume.jpg|CJ Hook costume\n</gallery>\n\n{{Descendants}}\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
