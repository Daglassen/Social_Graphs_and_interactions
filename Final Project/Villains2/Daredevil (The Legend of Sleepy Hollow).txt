He then stops in front of a man sleeping\u00a0atop a beer barrel\u00a0at whom he neighs\u00a0This wakes up the man who leaps into the air with a startled scream,\u00a0kicks the barrel out from under his feet and onto its side so that when he lands, it is on solid ground. Daredevil then watches as\u00a0Brom\u00a0leaps onto the barrel\u00a0and rolls it over to\u00a0the table,\u00a0serving the boys and himself some beer. As\u00a0Brom does this, Daredevil as well as a few of the neighborhood dogs lick their lips in unison as they want to taste the beer too.\u00a0At this, Brom\u00a0breaks open the top of the barrel with\u00a0one mighty blow of his large fist\u00a0and sets it down in front of Daredevil and the dogs so they can drink.\u00a0Daredevil appears a few days later, once again giving Brom a ride into town where he and his master see\u00a0the boys trying to assist\u00a0 [[Katrina Van Tassel|Katrina]]\u00a0with her groceries.\u00a0As they glare angrily at the boys and scare them away, Katrina comes out but is unimpressed when they bow to her and offer her a ride home.\u00a0A little later, when she accepts [[Ichabod Crane|Ichabod]]'s offer to walk her home\u00a0they become\u00a0jealous and\u00a0Daredevil runs through mud,\u00a0splattering it on\u00a0Ichabod. As\u00a0Brom picks up Katrina and her groceries on to his back, Daredevil\u00a0takes off for\u00a0her house. However,\u00a0when they arrive Ichabod jumps in front of them causing a big cloud\u00a0of dust\u00a0which he walks out of with Katrina.\u00a0After the dust disappears Brom is seen holding Katrina's groceries but his horse has mysteriously disappeared and doesn't appear throughout the rest of the film.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Some have speculated that [[The Headless Horseman]] is [[Brom Bones]] in disguise due to their similar physiques, and have further speculated that The Headless Horseman's Horse is Daredevil.  However, this is unlikely to be true for the following reasons:\n**Unlike Daredevil, the Horseman's Horse has a white stripe of fur from its forehead to its muzzle (though it is worth mentioning that this white stripe is not visible in every shot).\n**Daredevil has rounded, dark eyes, while the Horseman's Horse has deep, red eyes.\n**Daredevil is charcoal-grey with an ashy grey mane while both the Horseman's Horse's coat and mane are dark black.\n*In Washington Irving's original ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]'' (the story [[:en:The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow|Disney's adaptation]] was based upon), Brom's horse is named Daredevil and Ichabod's horse is named Gunpowder.  However, according to \"The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters\" by Jon Grant, Brom's horse is named Gunpowder in the Disney version. To avoid confusion, this article refers to Brom's horse as Daredevil and Ichabod's horse as Gunpowder.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\n\nBrom's horse dranking beer.png|Daredevil drinking beer with the dogs.\nBrom's horse giving Katrina a ride..png|Giving Katrina a ride home.\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-4289.jpg|Daredevil rearing\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-4294.jpg|Startling the man atop the beer barrel\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-5331.jpg|Daredevil and Brom frowning at The Sleepy Hollow Boys\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-5350.jpg|Bowing to Katrina\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-5501.jpg|In Ichabod's cloud of dust\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-5499.jpg|Arriving at Katrina's house\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-5427.jpg|Waiting for Brom to load Katrina's groceries onto his back\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps com-5416.jpg|Daredevil and Brom preparing to charge Ichabod\nTumblr ncvt1174tS1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4273.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4753.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4285.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4295.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-5314.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4303.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-5318.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4811.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4294.jpg\nIchabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps.com-4336.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n{{The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad characters]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
