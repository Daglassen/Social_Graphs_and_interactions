Stick has her adopted by a Greek Ambassador to keep her safe. When she's older, she's sent by Stick to manipulate Matt into coming to his side again, but Elektra ends up falling in love with Matt. They break up when Elektra takes it too far by capturing the man who murdered Matt's father and allowing Matt the opportunity to kill him, which Matt refuses. Matt tries to convince her that she doesn't belong in Stick's war and can be her own person, and they almost get back together before she kills a Hand ninja.

They confront Nobu and his ninjas on the rooftop in a final showdown, where Elektra sacrifices her life to save Matt.
