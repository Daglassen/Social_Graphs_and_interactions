She sleeps in the {{Term|BotW|Fishing Resort|link}} during the night.\n\nWhen {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} speaks to her, Flavi remarks on the weather, the warmth being nice when compared to the heat of the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Desert|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Mmm, the weather here is nice and warm. It's not at all like that blazing heat in the desert!|Flavi|BotW}}</ref> She then asks if Link is visiting Lurelin on vacation.<ref>{{Cite|Are you here on vacation?|Flavi|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about the Desert, Flavia explains that she's from {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Town|link}}, which is surrounded by the Desert.<ref>{{Cite|I came here from Gerudo Town. It's a place surrounded by an expansive desert.|Flavi|BotW}}</ref>\n\nFlavi came to Lurelin Village out of interest in {{Term|BotW|Eventide Island|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|The isle far off the shore to the east is called {{Color|BotW Blue|Eventide Island}}. It was tales of that island that brought me all the way out here.|Flavi|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You see that island over there? That's {{Color|BotW Blue|Eventide Island}}. I came all the way here so that I could go there.|Flavi|BotW}}</ref> During the day, she camps out on a hill just outside of the village and looks upon the Island. However, she's had difficulties in reaching it by sea and wonders if one needs wings to reach it.<ref>{{Cite|However, it's actually hard to get there by sea. It feels like you'd need to grow {{Color|BotW Red|wings}} to go there...|Flavi|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|If only I had some {{Color|BotW Red|wings}}...|Flavi|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring the rain, Flavi takes shelter under the umbrellas outside the Fishing Resort.<ref>{{Cite|It's starting to rain...|Flavi|BotW}}</ref> When Link speaks to her during this time, she admits to hating the rain as it makes her miss home.<ref>{{Cite|Oof... Rain is the worst. It really makes me miss home.|Flavi|BotW}}</ref> If Link says he likes the rain, she calls him a weirdo.<ref>{{Cite|[I like the rain!] What a weirdo.|Flavi|BotW}}</ref> It never rains in Gerudo Town, so while she was initially intrigued by it, it now annoys her.<ref>{{Cite|I grew up in Gerudo Town. It's completely surrounded by a desert. It never rains in the desert. I thought it was neat at first, but now I'm pretty sick of the frequent rain.|Flavi|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Gerudo|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Lurelin Village|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
