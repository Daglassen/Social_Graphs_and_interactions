Deeply sexist and obsessed with female rights, she is determined to free [[Yin (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yin]] from studying Woo Foo. She had a difficult childhood with her father and her lazy brother Mark, which led her to establish strong women's empowerment and feminist views and values. When Saranoia takes one of her wands, she takes on a set of characteristics and must abide by the rules of the wand, even if it's against her own will. She has been trying to terminate [[Master Yo]] and free Yin from [[Yang (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yang]]'s masculine influence.\n\nIn\u00a0\"[[The Truth Hurts (Yin Yang Yo!)|The Truth Hurts]]\", Saranoia was committed to an insane asylum and a restraining order was filed against her. At this point, Saranoia has given up being a wizard, has had plastic surgery, and is now the spokesperson for Repulsix.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Saranoia's name is a pun on \"paranoia\", which means a person that is a little insane and a little bit of crazy.\n*She resembles a demon, due to her horn-like ears and pointed tail.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nsaranoia watching.jpg\nyoung saranoia.png|Young Saranoia with her wizard father.\nSaranoia Pirate.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Females|Saranoia]]"
