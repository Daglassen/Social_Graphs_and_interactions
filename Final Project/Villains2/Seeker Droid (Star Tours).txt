It was tasked with hunting down a rebel spy which was tracked down to [[Star Tours (company)|Star Tours]] Spaceport THX1138.\n\nThe probe droid and an ambush of sky-troopers and [[stormtroopers]] halted the passage of Star Tours Flight 1401, a [[StarSpeeder 1000]] being helmed by accident by one [[C-3PO]]. Thee stormtroopers held the speeder as the probe droid located the spy and found it was one of the ship's passengers. As a result, the ship went to hyperdrive while ramming into the seeker droid, pushing it into space.\n\n=== Development History ===\nProwler 1000 Exploration Droids were created for Star Wars Episode III (2005) albeit as droids used by the [[Galactic Republic]] in the clone wars. They also made a number of expanded universe appearances leading up to Star Tours.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Star Tours: The Adventures Continue ===\nThe Seeker Droid appears in one of the two original opening scenes for Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. In its version of the scene it grabs onto the visor of the ship and holds a red screen which shows the faces of guests on it as it searches for the rebel spy.\n\nEventually it finds the spy (usually one of the guests) and encourages the sky-troopers to attack before the ride truly begins by ramming into the probe droid.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It was identified as, \"The Seeker Droid\" by a [[2002]] Star Tours [[Star Wars: Star Tours (toy line)|toy-line]].\n* One of the faces which flashes on the Seeker Droid's screen is that of [[George Lucas]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSTARTOURsPacks03-lg.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Star Tours characters]]\n[[Category:Droids]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
