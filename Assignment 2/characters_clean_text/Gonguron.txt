== Biography ==
Gonguron is a Goron who lives in Goron City with his older brother Bladon. Prior to Link's arrival, Gonguron had left the City to find the "secret of the hero," a mystery that is believed to be in Gorko Tunnel. He can be found excavating the Tunnel. Bladon however, is furious with him for leaving. Speaking with Bladon begins the first phase in the Shrine Quest "A Brother's Roast".
Upon finding Gonguron, it is discovered that he has collapsed from an overbearing hunger and cannot continue.  Bladon, who shortly arrives after, then tells Link to bring a Rock Roast from Gortram Cliff. The Rock Roast he brings is then Cooked, which invigorates Gonguron as he eats the now Deliciously Grilled Rock Roast.  The Roast gives Gonguron enough energy to finish excavating the Tunnel, and it is revealed that the hero's secret is actually the Kayra Mah Shrine. Gonguron comments that the secret looks familiar, referring to the Shae Mo'sah Shrine near Goron City.
After finding the Ancient Shrine, Gonguron and Bladon return to their home in Goron City. Gonguron's finding of the secret inspires him to keep digging, and he begins digging in their house while Bladon cheers him on.
