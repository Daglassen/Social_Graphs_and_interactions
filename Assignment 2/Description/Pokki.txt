Link cannot enter the [[Ancient Shrine]] because Pokki is collapsed over the pedestal where he must place his [[Sheikah Slate]] to gain entry. If Link speaks to Pokki, he will find out that she is dying of thirst and that only a drink called [[Noble Pursuit]] will save her.<ref>{{Cite|I'd just found the shrine too... Ugh, my throat... It's so dry... I can't move a muscle... If this really is the end... I wish I could have one last taste... One sip... One sip of an ice-cold {{Color|BotW Red|Noble Pursuit}}...|Pokki|BotW}}</ref> This gives Link the [[Shrine Quest]], \"[[The Perfect Drink]]\", and he cannot enter the Shrine until he finishes the Quest. If Link speaks to Pokki after bringing ice to [[Furosa]], he tells Pokki that there is a Noble Pursuit waiting for her in [[Gerudo Town]]. Pokki then stands up without hesitation and exclaims that she is leaving before running away toward town.<ref>{{Cite|Did you say \"best {{Color|BotW Blue|Noble Pursuit}} ever\"? Pfft, I am GONE!|Pokki|BotW}}</ref> After the Quest, Pokki can be found inside [[The Noble Canteen]] talking to the bartender, Furosa, about how great the taste of Noble Pursuit is.<ref>{{Cite|I ask you, Furosa, is there anything better than a taste of {{Color|BotW Blue|Noble Pursuit}}?|Pokki|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Names\n|align= left\n|enBr= \n|enBrM= \n|ja= \n|jaM= \n|esS= \n|esSM= \n|esL= \n|esLM= \n|frF= Pohrpi\n|frFM= \n|frC= \n|frCM= \n|de= \n|deM= \n|it= \n|itM= \n|ptP= \n|ptPM= \n|ptB= \n|ptBM= \n|nl= \n|nlM= \n|ru= \n|ruM= \n|ko= \n|koM= \n|zhT= \n|zhTM= \n|zhS= \n|zhSM= }}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW The Perfect Drink.jpg|Pokki at the beginning of \"The Perfect Drink\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
