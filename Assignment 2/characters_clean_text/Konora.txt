Konora is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Konora is a Gerudo who can first be found inside the Inn at the Kara Kara Bazaar. She lives in Gerudo Town, but she is stuck at the Kara Kara Bazaar because of the threat of the Divine Beast Vah Naboris and its lightning. When Link first speaks to Konora, she comments that the Divine Beast seems to get closer every day. Konora wonders how long it will be until she can return to Gerudo Town. If Link asks about the Divine Beast, she explains that she is talking about the giant thing roaming around the Gerudo Desert. Konora also tells Link it has been creating sandstorms and will blast lightning at anyone who comes near. She is too afraid of getting struck by the Divine Beast's lightning to travel back to Gerudo Town. If Link asks about Gerudo Town, Konora explains that it is a large, lively town to the southwest made up almost entirely of Gerudo people. However, she tells Link that he cannot enter Gerudo Town because men are not allowed inside. Konora wishes that a hero would do something about the Divine Beast Vah Naboris.
After calming Naboris, Konora can be found sitting in The Noble Canteen in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to her, she explains that she forgot where she lives because she has been gone so long. After a long pause, she yells that it is not a joke.
