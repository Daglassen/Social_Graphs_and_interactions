He welcomes [[Link]] and asks what he thinks of the place.<ref name=\"Welcome\">{{Cite|Welcome to {{Color|BotW Blue|Dueling Peaks Stable}}! What do you think of the place? Pretty nice, yeah? It might be hard to imagine now, but this place was nearly destroyed about 100 years ago. However, thanks to the blessings of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Dueling Peaks}}, everything is full of life again. Even the wild horses are back. There's a lot of energy in this place! So where are you heading? Both Kakariko Village and Hateno Village are nearby.|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> Rensa tells the hero that although it may be hard to believe, the area was nearly destroyed about 100 years ago.<ref name=\"Welcome\"/> Even so, Rensa cites the blessings of the [[Dueling Peaks]] as the reason everything is full of life again and the [[Wild Horse]]s have returned.<ref name=\"Welcome\"/> Rensa asks Link where he is heading and says that both [[Kakariko Village]] and [[Hateno Village]] are nearby.<ref name=\"Welcome\"/> If asked about the Wild Horses, Rensa asks if Link did not see any Horses on his way here.<ref name=\"Wild\"/> He points out that there are still quite a few around, though certainly not as many as in years past.<ref name=\"Wild\"/> He informs Link that Horses in the wild are untamed, as no one has trained or cared for them.<ref name=\"Wild\"/> Rensa advises Link to let his brother [[Tasseren]] know if he manages to catch and tame a Horse so he can register it for him.<ref name=\"Tasseren\"/> Rensa's boys, [[Shibo]] and [[Darton]], are incredibly knowledgeable about Horses, so he tells Link to feel free to pick their brains.<ref name=\"Wild\"/>\n\nWhen asked about Kakariko Village, Rensa says it is the Village where the [[Sheikah]] clan lives.<ref name=\"Kakariko\">{{Cite|[Kakariko Village?] Kakariko Village is the village where the Sheikah clan lives. It's said that, some time ago, they had advanced techniques that were more powerful than anything anyone had seen. But that power put them at odds with the king at the time, and they were scattered across the land... Anyway, if you leave here and follow the road straight to the north, you'll find a big bridge. Cross that and keep following the path, and you'll come to the Kakariko Village gate.|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> He tells Link that some time ago the Sheikah had advanced techniques that were more powerful than anything anyone had seen, but because that power put them at odds with the king at the time, the Sheikah were scattered across the land.<ref name=\"Kakariko\"/> If Link leaves the Stable and follows the path straight to the north, he will find [[Kakariko Bridge]].<ref name=\"Kakariko\"/> Crossing the Bridge and following the path will lead him to the Kakariko Village gate.<ref name=\"Kakariko\"/> When asked about Hateno Village, Rensa says it is a Village on the edge of [[Hyrule]],<ref name=\"Hateno\">{{Cite|[Hateno Village?] Hateno Village is a village on the edge of Hyrule. It was largely unaffected by the events of the {{Color|BotW Red|Great Calamity}}, so the people there are pretty easygoing. I hear they even have a {{Color|BotW Blue|research center}}... But folks tend to avoid the weird scientist who lives there... Anyway, head north from here until you reach a fork in the road. Then go east and just follow the road. It's a little far if you walk it, but with a horse, you should get there in under a day!|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> and was largely unaffected by the events of the [[Great Calamity]] so the people are easygoing.<ref name=\"Hateno\"/> Rensa tells Link that he has heard Hateno has a [[Hateno Ancient Tech Lab|research center]], but that folks tend to avoid [[Purah]], the weird scientist who lives there.<ref name=\"Hateno\"/> Rensa tells Link to head north until he reaches a fork in the road, then to follow the road to the east.<ref name=\"Hateno\"/> He says it is a far distance if walked, but with a Horse Link should reach Hateno Village in under a day.<ref name=\"Hateno\"/> After Link says goodbye, Rensa says that although everything in the area looks just as it always has, the effects of the Great Calamity still linger, and he warns the hero to be careful at night when monsters appear.<ref>{{Cite|Everything looks just as it always has, but the effects of the {{Color|BotW Red|Great Calamity}} still linger. For example, a lot of {{Color|BotW Blue|monsters}} come out at night, so be careful when the sun sets...|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> \n\nIf spoken to afterwards, Rensa notes that Horses are wild, so until Link calms them down it will be a crazy ride. Even so, Rensa claims there is no feeling quite like taming a wild stallion.<ref name=\"Calm\">{{Cite|They're wild, so 'til you calm 'em, it's gonna be one crazy ride. But there's no feeling quite like taming a wild stallion! Trust me\u2014I took second place in the Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition!|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> Rensa then boasts that he took second place in the [[Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition]].<ref name=\"Calm\"/> When he sees the look Link gives him, Rensa challenges the hero to a tame-off.<ref>{{Cite|HEY! I saw that look you gave me! ... Fine! You don't believe me? Let's go, pal! You and me. Right here. Right now. You want to challenge the second-place Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition winner to a tame-off?! YOU GOT IT, MISTER!|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> If Link declines, Rensa asks if he would dare turn down a challenge from the second-greatest Horse tamer in the world.<ref name=\"Second\"/> Rensa realizes there is not much he can do about that, however, and states it is only natural that the title of Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition Runner-Up would strike fear in Link's heart.<ref name=\"Second\"/> Rensa claims that he himself would never run and hide, and tells Link to come back when he has the confidence to challenge his taming skills.<ref name=\"Second\"/> However, if Link accepts the challenge, Rensa praises Link's competitive spirit.<ref name=\"Spirit\">{{Cite|That's the spirit! The only rule is that you must bring a wild horse back to this spot within the time limit!|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> The only rule of the challenge is that Link has to bring a wild Horse back to the spot Rensa is standing in under two minutes, which is Rensa's record.<ref name=\"Spirit\"/><ref>{{Cite|My record is two minutes flat, so you need to bring back a wild horse within that time. PREPARE FOR EXTREME TAMING!|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> This begins the \"[[Wild Horses]]\" [[Side Quest]]. Rensa advises Link that because Horses are skittish, it's best to approach them quietly.<ref>{{Cite|Wild horses are a bit skittish, so you need to sidle up to them nice and quiet-like.|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> Rensa also asks Link that he not stray too far from the Stable, as he would not be able to record an accurate time.<ref>{{Cite|If you go too far, then I can't record an accurate time. Could you try to stay at least somewhat near the stable?|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> If Link fails to return with a Horse under the two-minute time limit, Rensa acknowledges the challenge of the task, but tells Link to not be discouraged, and that it took him years to place second in the competition.<ref>{{Cite|Hahaha! Breaking the two-minute mark is pretty tough, right? But don't be discouraged. I mean, it took me years of practice to place second in the Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition.|Rensa|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce Link has caught a Horse and brought it back before time runs out, Rensa is amazed that Link could beat his record so easily.<ref name=\"Amazing\">{{Cite|{{Big|Amazing!}} But...I can't believe you beat my two-minute record so easily... I mean, I won second place in the Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition! To be fair, it was just my brother and I competing... Anyway, here's the purse for winning the second official Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition! You earned it.|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> Rensa then admits that the only participants who actually competed in the Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition were his brother and himself.<ref name=\"Amazing\"/> He gives Link the purse for winning the second Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition, which is a [[Purple Rupee]].<ref name=\"Amazing\"/> After Link's show of talent, Rensa guesses there is more competition out there than he originally knew about, and that maybe Hyrule is not all bad after all.<ref>{{Cite|I guess there's more competition out there than I knew about. Maybe Hyrule isn't all bad after all!|Rensa|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks Rensa about Wild Horses after completing the challenge, Rensa will be surprised, as Link was the one to beat him, the man who placed second in the Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition.<ref>{{Cite|You're asking me now? There certainly are not as many as in years past, but there are still quite a few Around... If you manage to catch one, let my brother Tasseren know. He'll register the horse for you! My boys are wellsprings of information about horses, but I'm sure you don't need another lecture.
