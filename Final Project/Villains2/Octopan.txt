They look to be a combination of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod cephalopods] and human beings. \n\nNotable members of the species include the sea witches\u00a0[[Ursula]] and [[Morgana]].\n\n==Biology and Society==\nLittle is known about the octopan race, except that they and [[Merpeople|merpeople]] are long-time enemies. \n\nOctopans can have purple, green, or dark-blue skin, and unlike merpeople, have a diverse style of \"clothing\" and can seemingly dress up their upper half however they like. As it seems to be part of their octopus half, though, it's not sure how this is done. <br/>\nThey, or at the very least Ursula and Morgana, also have no qualms eating living creatures or enjoying semi-cannibalistic meals; as Ursula was shown to eat live shrimp and Morgana offered [[Melody]] a plate that included some type of tentacled \"snack\".\n\nOctopans have strong tentacles that can be used as arms and legs, but unlike normal cephalopods, they seem to possess a skeletal system. It's unsure how it connects to their more flexible lower half, but it can be assumed that starting their pelvis, there is only muscle.\n\n==Abilities==\nOctopans may possess a great amount of magic and relevant abilities, the best example being Ursula. They practice this either through making potions, harnessing talismans, or setting up unbreakable contracts, though the original movie also showcased some minor supernatural occurrences that appeared to come naturally; like spawning moving images or an object. \n\nNevertheless, not all octopans are equally gifted and some might not have any magic abilities at all.\n\n==Media Appearances==\n* Octopans first appeared in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film) The Little Mermaid], with the main antagonist, Ursula.\n* They were further expanded on in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(TV_series) The Little Mermaid TV-show],\u00a0specifically in the episode \"[[Heroes]]\", wherein Ursula revived a deceased octopan army she had formerly commanded.\n* Octopans then appeared in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_II:_Return_to_the_Sea The Little Mermaid II], starring Ursula's sister, Morgana.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The physical design of octopans are based on [https://warriorsofmyth.fandom.com/wiki/Cecaelia the cecaelia].\n*The name \"octopan\" was solely mentioned in the \"[https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes Heroes]\" episode;\n**It's possible that it is not the name of the species, but of the army featured;\n**This episode is the only instance where male octopans made an appearance.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" captiontextcolor=\"#000000\" orientation=\"square\" position=\"center\" captionsize=\"medium\" captionalign=\"center\">\nUrsula TheSeawItCH11.png|Ursula, from The Little Mermaid.\nUrsulainSkeletonForm.jpg|Image showing the presence of bones, featuring Ursula.\nUrsula model.png|Detailed artwork of an octopan's body, featuring Ursula.\nProfile_-_Morgana.jpg|Morgana, from The Little Mermaid II.\nQueen Morgana Melody and Ariel.jpg|Portrayal of the strength an octopan's tentacles possess, featuring Morgana.\nCecillians.png|Portrayal of octopan children, featuring Ursula, Morgana, and [[Ursula and Morgana's Mother|their mother]].\nheroes12.jpg|Screenshot from the \"Heroes\" episode.\nheroes93.jpg|Screenshot from the \"Heroes\" episode.\nheroes94.jpg|Screenshot from the \"Heroes\" episode.\nheroes147.jpg|Screenshot from the \"Heroes\" episode.\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Cephalopods]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]"
