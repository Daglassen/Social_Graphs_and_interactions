characterizing moment was when the Gate the Dark Ones was seen Golden Age was the only monkey not cowering fear instead looking shocked and having gross fascination with the sight Chiro also described him always being obsessed with learning seemed have been very ambitious and proud had believed the whole team least him should take new roles above protecting the city wanted rule over something his comrades didn agree appears have grown resentful for their betrayal Despite this has fascination with his replacement Chiro seeing something similar him seems care the least about Antauri and Nova

shock and abhor fascination approached the gate before yelling them and jumping the machine causing malfunction and letting loose the Dark Ones which corrupted the Alchemist where eventually became the Skeleton King During his time Team Leader not much known outside the time was training Nova deal with harsh cold and she unleashed her temper him Eventually his thirst for power grew where wanted take over and rule Shuggazoom something that the rest team would not let happen Eventually they exiled him and remained stasis until Chiro accidentally awoke him when turned his shield After his first battle with the team was found Skeleton King and turned into something monster the episode Versus Chiro replaced clone him personally made Skeleton King Mandarin retains mostly the same personality and memories the original though seems bit more irrational and erratic This may due the modifications Skeleton King had done the clone The replica has continued fight Chiro and the rest the Hyperforce even appearing the revived Skeleton King side the end partnered with Valeena out fear and necessity though was spared while she was killed off when her usefulness was done The original Mandarin fought with his shield and sword his weapons didn display many his abilities though created force orb his initial appearance and may have some other forms telepathy His duplicate also had his Sword and Shield before being having hands become claw bone Monkey Mind Scream Monkey Slash Claw Chiro Mandarin was surprised when Chiro activate Mandarin weapons and learned that Chiro has the power primate Because their similarities had tried get Chiro over his side Skeleton King commented his choice having Chiro rule Mandarin side reflection yourself refers Chiro hairless monkey The Hyperforce appears angry and bitter for them exiling him from Shuggazoom They are now enemies Not much known about their individual relationships though Antauri may have had the most respect for him was tough Nova and Otto was once his closest ally implied Mandarin and Antauri trained together the Veron Temple Skeleton King Despite the original Mandarin failing him Skeleton King created clone and the clone was loyal where was because him the Skeleton King was eventually able revived Also while Skeleton King killed off the more powerful Valeena Mandarin appeared his side the final episode Valeena His clone and Valeena have tough relationship scared her while she annoyed him Despite this saved her because her knowledge Skeleton King surpasses his they have some slight form comradeship Otto Before Mandarin turned evil Otto was his closest ally best friend Now that evil though nothing between them other than rivalry said that before Mandarin became evil and Otto were close friends Soul Evil Mandarin said while fighting Otto You were once closest ally Otto was said that once had pure heart like that Chiro His clone u2019s greatest fear Valeena unclear what the original Mandarin u2019s fear was seems develop fear Skeleton King has displayed the least amount attacks compared the other monkeys The Mandarin clone the only formless have artificial intelligence instead being mindless drone Also unlike the others not easily destroyed never revealed what happened the real Mandarin was taken away into the shadows red formless and was never seen again very likely that Mandarin deceased because Skeleton King was willing kill Valeena may had been close the Alchemist because the Alchemist let him ride his shoulders even let the Alchemist pet him has been arrested twice with that being the first time the Hyperforce then the second time Skeleton King Mandarin u2019s clone often confused the original Mandarin"
