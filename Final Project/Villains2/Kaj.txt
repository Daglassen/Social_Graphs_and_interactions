Afterwards, he had his fellow Leopard Men kidnap [[Jane Porter]], hoping that by crowning her as Opar's new queen, she would free them from the spell La had placed on on them.\n\nHowever, kidnapping Jane brought the ire of [[Tarzan]], who was tricked by La into retrieving Jane before Kaj could complete the ritual. After Tarzan and La defeated them and the former left with Jane, La intended to teach her Leopard Men to fear her by sacrificing Kaj to the giant Kraken she kept in the dungeons beneath her palace. However, Tarzan, Jane, [[Terk]], [[Tantor]], and [[Archimedes Q. Porter|Professor Porter]] returned to save Kaj after Jane explained the Leopard Men's plight.\n\nTarzan saved Kaj as the Kraken tried to drag him to his death, only to be grabbed himself and pulled into the depths. Forlorn at the loss of Tarzan, he revealed Tarzan's \"death\" to Jane, allowing Tarzan (who had escaped the octopus) to steal La's staff and give it to the former. Jane then reversed the spell, killing La's body in the process and returning the Leopard Men, Kaj included, to their natural forms: leopards.\u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*In his Leopard Man form, Kaj is defined from other Leopard Men by his green clothes.\n*Kaj is the only Leopard Man with a name.\n\n{{Tarzan}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Leopards and cheetahs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
