Aresko had the man arrested, while Myles ate some of his fruit mocking nearby citizens who didn't have the courage to stand up to them. However, the merchant was spared when Grint and Aresko received a false \"Code Red\" from [[Ezra Bridger]], luring them away so he could help himself to some of the fruit they almost confiscated.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\" spacing=\"small\">\nBreaking-Ranks-15.jpg\nWho's gonna stop us.png|\"Who's gonna stop us?\"\nThere is no friendship in war.png\nMyles Grint in Breaking Ranks.png\nEmpire Day 16.jpg\nImperials arrest a merhcant.jpg\nCall to action 2.jpg|Myles' death\nGalactic Empire - Myles Grint.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External Links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Myles Grint|Wookieepedia}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grint, Myles}}\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
