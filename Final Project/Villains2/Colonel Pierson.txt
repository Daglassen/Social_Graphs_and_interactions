He is [[Moki]]'s former army commanding officer.\n== Role ==\nHe shoots a grizzly bear and one of her cubs after she invades his land and kills a steer. However, he misses the [[Wahb|other]]. The surviving cub (who is later named \"Wahb\" by Moki due to his 4 toes) falls over a cliff and into a river and is swept downstream. At 3 years of age, Wahb appears and frightens a ranch hand, whereupon Pierson orders Moki to trap the bear; but Wahb avoids capture. Several years later, Moki encounters Wahb in the mountains. As the bear does not harm him, Moki concludes that a mystical tie binds Wahb's destiny with his own. Wahb reappears on the Pierson ranch at roundup time and stampedes the cattle. Pierson sets out to kill Wahb, but the wily bear doubles back and begins to track his pursuer. Moki attempts to warn Pierson of his danger but to no avail. Pierson meets the bear head on; his horse rears and Pierson is thrown. Wahb is about to attack Pierson when Moki intervenes and makes the Cree sign of friendship to the bear, causing him to lumber off. Pierson raises his rifle to shoot, but Moki stops him when he notices Wahb scratching a mark on a nearby tree. Moki interprets the tree-marking as a sign that the bear will never again return to Pierson's.\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:King of the Grizzlies characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Colonels]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
