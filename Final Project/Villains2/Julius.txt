Bearing striking physical and vocal similarities to [[Pete|Peg-Leg Pete]], Julius was created by the wicked [[Doctor Frankenollie]]. As part of the mad doctor\u2019s experiment, Julius\u2019s brain and body were swapped with an unsuspecting [[Mickey Mouse]], leading to citywide chaos as Julius pursues Mickey\u2019s girlfriend, [[Minnie Mouse]].\n\n==Role in the short==\nJulius is unleashed from his lair under Frankenollie's lab to switch brains with Mickey Mouse and the experiment was done successfully although it killed Frankenollie in the process, however, Julius and Mickey not only switched brains but bodies as well. In Mickey's body, Julius was able to view Mickey's wallet where he finds a picture of Mickey and Minnie. He develops feelings for her and rushes out to find her. He spots her at a shopping store and enters to proclaim his love. Minnie thinks it is Mickey she is talking to, and when the real Mickey in Julius' body enters to save her, she attacks him. Mickey is able to explain and battles Julius while Minnie is safe on top of a skyscraper. Mickey and Julius end up being electrocuted on cable wires, switching back in the process. Now that Julius is in his rightful body, he has a better chance of destroying Mickey and getting Minnie. Still, Mickey manages to free Minnie from his grasp. He is accidentally knocked off the building by Minnie but is pulled up repeatedly like a yo-yo as he is tied to a rope attached to a moving Hawaiian girl's arm on a billboard. In the end, Mickey and Minnie use Julius to pull a raft to Hawaii for vacation.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''===\nJulius appears as a secret boss in the game, located in [[Traverse Town]]. He emerges from a sewer grate below to the surface to attack [[Sora]] or [[Riku]]. After defeating him, he retreats back to the sewer grate in sudden panic, and Sora or Riku earn the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Ultima Weapon|Ultima Weapon]] [[Keyblade]]. He's the first secret boss in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series to be a Disney character that is not exclusive to the series. Why he attacked the boys, or how he found his way to Traverse Town, is unknown.\n\nAs with other past secret bosses having some importance in the story of the next game (such as [[Sephiroth]] being part of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' story or [[Young Xehanort]] from ''Dream Drop Distance''), he doesn't seem to share this factor.\n\nMuch like Pete himself in the Japanese versions, Julius by proxy is voiced by the late [[T\u014dru \u014chira]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRunaway_Brain_screenshoot_21.jpg|Julius in Frankenollie's lab\nRunaway_Brain_screenshoot_26.jpg|Julius (in Mickey's body) approaches Mickey (in Julius's body)\nRunaway_Brain_screenshoot_28.jpg|Julius in Mickey's body\nJulius in Mickey's Body.png|Julius in Mickey's Body Enters the The Wet Rat\nRunaway_Brain_screenshoot_33.jpg|Julius and Mickey's brains are switched back\nRunaway_Brain_screenshoot_34.jpg|Julius holding a fearful Minnie\nRunaway_Brain_screenshoot_35.jpg|Julius battles Mickey\nRunaway_Brain_screenshoot_36.jpg|Julius right before his defeat\nRunaway Brain screenshoot 38.png|Julius' defeat\nRunaway Brain screenshoot 40.jpg|Julius being used as a steed\n</gallery>\n===Video games===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nJulius_KH.png|Julius as he appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''.\nJulius_KH3D.png|Julius and Sora.\n</gallery>\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRunaway Brain model concept 1.jpg|Julius model sheet by [[Andreas Deja]]\nRunaway Brain merhcandise 3.jpg\nRunaway Brain merhcandise 2.jpg|Julius Action Figures\nRunaway Brain merhcandise 1.jpg\nDSRunawayBrainJulius.jpg\n1990sVillainspostcard.jpeg\nJulius.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* The name \"Julius\" may have been inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s very first cartoon character, [[Julius the Cat]], a character from the ''[[Alice Comedies]]'', created long before both [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] and Mickey Mouse.\n* Julius is the first iteration of Pete that does not to have \"Pete\" in its name.\n* Julius is the first secret boss in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series to be of an existing Disney character.\n\n==External links==\n*{{KH|Julius}}\n*[[w:c:villains:Julius (Disney)|Julius]] on the [[w:c:villains:Main Page|Villains Wiki]]\n\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts Bosses]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]"
