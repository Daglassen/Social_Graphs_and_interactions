Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you... an escape.|Davy Jones|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}\n\n'''Davy Jones''' is the main antagonist of the [[2006]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', the secondary antagonist of the [[2007]] sequel, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'', and a cameo antagonist in the [[2017]] sequel, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''. He is based on a character of the same from nautical-folklore, whose name is used as a euphemism for a watery grave.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Background===\nOnce a human pirate and a good man, Davy Jones was known to be a great sailor, Jones was originally a heroic man like [[Jack Sparrow]] before meeting [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]]. He fell in love with the sea goddess Calypso, who charged him with the duty to ferry souls who died at sea to the other side through the use of ''[[the Flying Dutchman]]''. After ten years of service, he could set foot on dry land and spend one day with Calypso.\n\nJones devoted himself to the duty he was charged with for ten years. But whenever Davy Jones came ashore, Calypso was nowhere to be found. Heartbroken and enraged by her betrayal, Jones becomes evil and psychopathic and plotted with the First [[Brethren Court]] and showed them how to bind her into human form; the Court agreed with him to imprison her forever. But the pain of Calypso's betrayal caused him was too much to live with, so Davy Jones carved out his own heart and locked it away in the [[Dead Man's Chest]].\n\nAbandoning his duty, Davy Jones turned into a sea humanoid monster (with an octopus face, a tentacles beard, a claw of crab as a hand and a giant crab leg) then returned to the seven seas, only now sailors everywhere would fear him to the death, for Jones had turned into a fierce and cruel pirate, with an insatiable taste for all things brutal.\n\n===Personality===\nDavy Jones has a strong Scottish accent which is accented by various vocal and facial tics and has an unctuous and mocking laugh. He has commonly extended vowel sounds and is known to release water through his mouth when in despair or rage. Despite Jones' evil and ruthless nature, his character has appeared to be deeply influenced by situations involving love and passion, as a result of the ruined relationship he had with Calypso, the sea goddess, in the past. Davy Jones fell madly in love with the goddess Calypso. His character's passionate nature is rarely shown to others, such as when he plays his theme on the pipe organ whilst shedding a single tear over Calypso and ultimately meeting her aboard the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. He had cut out his own heart, but even then, not even Calypso thought Davy Jones was cruel. Davy Jones is similar to [[Cutler Beckett]] in personality as both men were: cruel, cunning, ruthless, greedy, and murderous among other traits. However, unlike the coward Beckett, Jones can be very scary and quick-tempered in order to show he means business.\n\n[[File:JonesOrgan.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Davy Jones playing his organ.]]\nJones had a [[Davy Jones' pipe organ|pipe organ]] on board the ''Flying Dutchman'', and play it seemingly on a daily basis. Utilizing the tentacles that made up his \"beard\", Jones plays his organ in a way that could only be matched if play by three or more ordinary human organists. The song he often played was the same as the one played by his locket. In times of intense emotional anguish, Jones would use his organ to vent his anger and suffering. It is through his organ that he would show his more sensitive and troubled side.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDavy Jones' appearance was not unlike that of many other sailors; but after becoming evil and crazy and after abandoning his duty, he had gradually taken the appearance of various aquatic life, flora, and fauna. In his new form, Jones' head resembled an Octopus, with a \"beard\" of 46 tentacles hanging from his face. During his duel with [[Jack Sparrow]], he lost one of his two larger tentacles. A siphon was located on the left side of his face, which makes up for his lack of a human nose. He had a crab claw for his left arm and his right leg resembled that of a crab, which in turn resembled a peg leg. Davy Jones' hat, which was a tricorn, had its front corn was bigger than the other two and divided, so that its silhouette resembled devil horns.\n\nJones' only weapon was a sword he normally carried attached to his belt. Before using the small sword of the then-deceased [[James Norrington]], Jones carried an old barnacle-encrusted broadsword at his side.\n\n===Power and abilities===\nBeing the captain of the ''Flying Dutchman'' gave Davy Jones the chance to journey between the land of the dead and the living. This was most likely the reason for his other supernatural traits, including the ability to teleport himself and walk through solid objects. Jones was also able to restore the ''[[Black Pearl|Wicked Wench]]'' when he raised the ship from the depths after it was burned and sunk by the East India Trading Company. However, Jones could not step on land but once every ten years and by abandoning his duty as the ferryman to the afterlife he brought a curse upon himself and his crew, which caused their transformation into fish-men. Being part octopus and crab Davy Jones is able to use his crab claw to bend swords or even break them and use his tentacle beard to his things or suffocate others. Since cutting his own heart out, Jones is nearly immortal and immune to all forms of injury. However this can be use against him as if someone held his heart they can kill him or control him.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''===\nDavy Jones (the folklore figure) is mentioned by the [[Pirate Crew (Peter Pan)|pirates]] in this 1953 film during a song. While singing, \"''[[A Pirate's Life (Is a Wonderful Life)|A Pirate's Life]]''\", one of the lyrics is, \"''A pirate's life is a wonderful life, they never bury your bones. For when it's all over, a jolly sea rover drops in on his friend Davy Jones. Ohhhh! His very good friend Davy Jones''\". This line is also sung by [[Mr. Smee]] on his way to [[Captain Hook|his captain]].\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''===\nDavy Jones is briefly named by [[Will Turner]] when he threatens to take his own life on the [[Black Pearl]] as leverage against [[Captain Barbossa|Barbossa]] to obtain the freedom of [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and the crew of the [[HMS Interceptor]].\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''===\nThirteen years after making the deal to raise the ''Black Pearl'' from the depths, [[Jack Sparrow]] owed the legendary Davy Jones his soul. To remind Jack of his debt, Jones sent [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]], a friend of Jack's who joined Jones' crew, as an emissary to warn Jack to repay his debt, in which he has to serve aboard the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' or he would be sent to Davy Jones' Locker. Bootstrap Bill gave Jack Sparrow the Black Spot, thereby having Jack marked for death by Jones' terrible leviathan, the [[Kraken]].\n\n[[File:Jones Jack P2.jpg|thumb|250px|Davy Jones with [[Jack Sparrow]]]]\nDays later, during a thunderstorm at night, Jack Sparrow and the ''Black Pearl'' arrive at what seems to be the ''Flying Dutchman'' but is really a scuttled ship destroyed by the Kraken. The real ''Dutchman'' rises from under the sea and the surviving crew members were rounded up by the ''Dutchman'' crew so that they could choose to join his crew aboard the ''Dutchman''. Of the men captured on board was Will Turner, who was tricked by Jack Sparrow to search on the scuttled ship. Davy Jones himself approaches the fearful crew and asks, \"Do you fear death?\", and offered them \"an escape\". After one frightened sailor answers that he will serve, Jones responds mockingly, his crew then proceeds to laugh. He realizes that Will Turner, one who is neither dead nor dying, is on the ship because of Jack Sparrow wanting to settle his debt.\n\nTempted to accept that offer, Jones spotted the overlooking ''Pearl'', he teleports to the ship to confront Sparrow. Despite Jack's excuse that he was the only captain for two years until Hector Barbossa's mutiny, Jones refused to listen, stating that he was \"a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless\", and also reminds him of his constant self-introduction as \"Captain Jack Sparrow\". Ultimately, the two agreed that Jack will bring Jones one hundred souls to replace his own within the next three days. Keeping Will as a \"good-faith payment\", Jones removes the black spot from Jack's hand and allowed Sparrow to go on his way to collect the remaining ninety-nine souls.\n\n[[File:Jones accept the offer.png|thumb|left|250px|Jones accepts to play [[Liar's Dice]]]]\nAs the ''Dutchman'' sailed one rainy night, Davy Jones played his organ until there was a commotion on deck. When he went to investigate, Jones discovered Bootstrap Bill trying to save Will Turner, his son, from the Bo'sun's lashing. Making the connection between the two, Jones became highly amused and then forced Bootstrap to have Will punished by Jimmy Legs or by the hands of Bootstrap himself. Knowing that Bootstrap would prefer his hand, Jones watched as Bootstrap Bill begrudgingly give Will five lashes.\n\nLater, Will challenges Davy Jones to a game of Liar's Dice, the purpose of which was to find out where Jones hides the key to the Dead Man's Chest. Fearing for the safety of his heart, though refusing to show weakness in front of his crew, Jones agreed. The stakes for which they gambled Will's soul for an eternity of service, against the key to the Chest. Although Will was saved by his loving father, Bootstrap Bill, Jones did give Will a glimpse of where he kept the key to the Chest.\n\n[[File:Davy Jones Crew Summon Kraken DMC.jpg|thumb|250px|Davy Jones summoning the [[Kraken]]]]\nThe next morning, Davy Jones realizes that Will Turner stole his key, and had escaped with the aid of his father. Knowing Will was aboard the ''Edinburgh Trader'', Davy Jones forced Bootstrap Bill to watch as he summons the Kraken to destroy the ship carrying Turner. However, he was not discovered among the wreckage, and, sending Bootstrap Bill to the brig, ordered the survivors to be killed. Shortly afterward Davy Jones knew that Will had been sent by Jack Sparrow to steal the key, so he ordered to sail for Isla Cruces to retrieve the Chest before Sparrow could get it. However, upon reaching Isla Cruces, Jones spotted some of Jack Sparrow's crew on the deserted island through his spyglass. Since Davy Jones himself couldn't set foot on land for nearly a decade, he ordered Maccus to lead a handful of crewmen to go ashore and seize the Chest in his stead. He ordered the ship to dive before sending his crew ashore; they later returned with the Chest in possession.\n\n[[File:Deadmanschest1-1-.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Davy Jones with the [[Dead Man's Chest]]]]\nAs Jack Sparrow's crew returned aboard the ''Black Pearl'', the ''Flying Dutchman'' rose out of the water beside them. Sparrow confronted Jones and taunted him with a jar of dirt until Jones ordered to attack the ''Pearl''. Giving chase, the ''Pearl'' outruns the ''Dutchman''. Despite his crew thinking they're giving up, Jones summons the Kraken instead and it attacks the ship. After two attacks, the ''Black Pearl'' was finally pulled down into Davy Jones' Locker along with Jack Sparrow as Jones surveys on his spyglass. With the debt settled, Davy Jones attends to the Dead Man's Chest, opening it only to find his heart missing. Shocked and believing that Jack Sparrow took the heart with him to Davy Jones' Locker, Davy Jones screams \"Damn you, Jack Sparrow!\" in anguish, instilling fear and pain in his crew.\n\nBut it was [[James Norrington]] who stole Davy Jones' heart. Norrington gave the heart to [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the East India Trading Company, now given the leverage to force Jones and his crew to do his bidding.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===\nBy this time, [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] has the heart of Davy Jones, thereby having control of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' and its captain. The ''Dutchman'' now roams the seven seas, unstoppable, destroying pirate ships without mercy, under the command of [[James Norrington|Admiral Norrington]]. A quest was undertaken to gather the Brethren Court and, unbeknownst to Jones, saving Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. During the quest, [[Tia Dalma]] reveals that Davy Jones was charged by Calypso, the sea goddess and his lover, to ferry the dead to the next world; in return, Jones could step upon the land for one day every ten years. But Jones abandoned his duty and became a monster.\n\n[[File:Jonesconfrontation.jpg|thumb|250px|Davy Jones confronted by Beckett]]\nIn his command, Beckett orders Davy Jones to attack pirate ships in the seas. But upon seeing the massacre, Beckett is infuriated when Jones uses his habit of leaving no one alive in the process; and Mercer, Beckett's assistant, names Jones \"a loose cannon\". By this point, Beckett had Jones kill his \"pet\", the [[Kraken]]. Because he wanted prisoners to interrogate, Beckett had the Dead Man's Chest brought aboard the ''Dutchman'', infuriating Jones, along with armed EITC gunmen to shoot Jones's heart should he disobey. The EITC soldiers would be led by [[James Norrington|Admiral James Norrington]], the very man who presented Jones' heart to Beckett.\n\n[[File:JonesServitude.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Davy Jones aboard the ''Dutchman'' after Norrington's death]]\nLater, the ''Dutchman'' was signaled to attack the ''Empress'', the ship of the Pirate Lord [[Sao Feng]]; Feng is killed but not before giving [[Elizabeth Swann]] the title of captain and Pirate Lord. Davy Jones's crew boarded the vessel and apprehended the crew. When Jones asked the ''Empress'' crew about their captain, the crew pointed to Elizabeth. Jones was in disbelief that she was the captain, but Admiral Norrington recognized her and ordered the ship to be towed. Elizabeth and her new crew are imprisoned in the brig until Admiral Norrington helps them escape the ''Dutchman''. Norrington was mortally wounded by a mentally deranged [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]] while freeing Elizabeth's crew. Upon arriving at the scene, Davy Jones asked James Norrington if he feared death. Norrington then speared Jones with his ceremonial sword before dying. Not affected by the attack, Jones said, \"I take that as a no.\" Pulling out Norrington's sword, Jones admired the blade and kept it for himself. Jones' crew then attempts mutiny as they kill the EITC soldiers on the ''Dutchman''. However, Mercer still possessed the key to the Chest and organizes a defense which includes Mullroy and Murtogg aiming a cannon at the Chest, forcing Jones to continue under Beckett's service.\n\nBy the time the ''Flying Dutchman'' caught up with Cutler Beckett's ship, the ''Endeavour'', Beckett himself had summoned Davy Jones. When Jones walked into Beckett's cabin, he was shocked to see Will Turner once again, this time having tea with Beckett. It was here that Davy Jones learns of the quest to rescue [[Jack Sparrow]] and the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' from the Locker as well as the threat of Calypso. Jones claimed that the world was rid of Calypso, but he was rebuked by Turner, who informed him that the Brethren Court intended to release her. Hearing this, Jones divulges that he made an agreement with the First Court to imprison Calypso forever by showing how to bind her in human form. Will then realized that Davy Jones had loved Calypso wondered after which betrayal he cut out his heart. As Jones and Turner came close to exchanging blows, Turner made clear of his terms for leading them to Shipwreck Cove. Jones said that he would only accept if Calypso was murdered. Turner then told Jones that she was imprisoned on the ''Black Pearl'', which has now sailed to Shipwreck Cove, leading Beckett to ask Turner how he intended to lead them there. Turner then pulled out [[Jack Sparrow's compass|Jack's compass]], a mystical item that could lead its user to the thing that they wanted most.\n\n[[File:'At World's End' - Davy Jones.jpg|thumb|250px|Davy Jones while meeting Calypso]]\nWhile the Brethren Court convened, Jones reunited with Calypso in her human shape of Tia Dalma, locked in the brig of the ''Black Pearl''. Here, the two former lovers engage in a poignant conversation wherein several things between the two are revealed, such as the reasons for which Calypso did not meet Jones after his first decade of service on the ''Flying Dutchman'' and the subsequent mutation of Davy Jones. Tia Dalma touches his chest, and Jones is briefly seen in his original human form, including a long and full beard with multiple braids parallel to his facial tentacles. Tia Dalma says that after her release, she willfully give her love to him and that the Brethren Court will learn \"How cruel I can be!\" Davy Jones, despite his hatred, seems unable to truly hate Calypso and tells her that his heart will always belong to her, before leaving the ''Pearl''.\n\n[[File:Beckett and Jones during the parlay.png|thumb|250px|Beckett and Jones during parley|left]]\nThe next day, there was a parley on a sandbar in between the Brethren Court's fleet and Beckett's armada, which outnumbered the pirates greatly. Standing on the sandbar was Will Turner, Cutler Beckett, and Davy Jones meeting with [[Hector Barbossa]], Elizabeth Swann, and Jack Sparrow. Because he couldn't step on land, Davy Jones stood on a bucket of water. During the parley, Jones brought up the debt which Jack escaped from, which then prompted Elizabeth to offer Jack in exchange for Will. It was agreed and Jack was given over to Jones, who later sent Jack to the ''Dutchman's'' brig. The pirates would not surrender, however, and the battle was inevitable. Though Jones knew that Calypso would take care of the Brethren when they release her; but the tides had turned when Will Turner reveals to Calypso, at the moment she was freed, that Davy Jones was the one who taught the Brethren Court how to imprison her. As the winds blew, Cutler Beckett ordered to signal Jones to \"give no quarter.\" At that moment, a storm formed spontaneously, and Jones took it as a sign that Calypso had been released, but realized it was for the worse.\n\n[[File:Jack DavyJones Duel Maelstrom.jpg|thumb|250px|Jones fighting Sparrow in the maelstrom]]\nAs the ''Flying Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' sail into battle, a monstrous maelstrom was formed. Despite Mercer's protests, Davy Jones took the helm and steered the ''Dutchman'' straight into the swirling vortex, engaging in epic battle. Jones ordered the cannoneers to fire, and for several minutes, the two ships exchanged broadsides. After a stray cannonball hit the quarterdeck, Jones took advantage of Mercer's moment of weakness, killing him with his tentacles and retrieves the key to the Dead Man's Chest. While descending the stairs, however, Davy Jones spotted Jack Sparrow, out of the brig, with the chest in hand. Jones then tried to seize the chest but ended up engaging Sparrow in an intense sword fight atop the mast of the ''Dutchman''. Jack Sparrow almost beat Davy Jones until his sword was broken by Jones himself. The fight led to the deck, where Will Turner, who boarded the ''Dutchman'', fought his father [[William Turner Sr.|Bootstrap Bill Turner]]. Making his way through the battle on the ''Dutchman'' to get to the Chest, Jones continued his duel with Sparrow. After knocking Sparrow to the ground by Jones' massive crab arm. By the end of the battle, Sparrow acquires both the Chest and the key while Jones battles Will and Elizabeth.\n\n[[Image:Davy Jones Death AWE.PNG|thumb|250px|Davy Jones before his death|left]]\nOverpowering Elizabeth, Davy Jones closed in for the kill before he is subsequently impaled through the back by Will. Undaunted, Jones bends the tip of Will's sword so he cannot remove it and kicks him aside. Looking at the two, Jones realized their relationship before holding Will at sword-point, asking if he fears death. He is then interrupted by Jack asking \"Do you?\" as he holds Jones' still-beating heart and a sword in the other hand, taunting him in a desperate bid to save Will. Before Jack can stab the heart, Jones thrusts and twists his sword deep into Will's chest, leaving Jack visibly shocked. Suddenly, coming to his senses, Bootstrap Bill jumps upon Jones to fight him and briefly overpowers Jones but is quickly defeated. Simultaneously, Sparrow helps Turner put his hand on his broken sword and plunge it into Davy Jones' beating heart. Seeing his heart stabbed, Jones staggers before he looks up into the sky, in which a blast of lightning is visible, his last word being \"Calypso.\" Davy Jones then tumbles backward off the ship and falls into the still raging maelstrom and Will takes his place as captain of the Flying Dutchman.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===\n[[File:Davy Jones claw.png|thumb|220x220px|Jones back from the dead]]\nDavy Jones only appears in the post-credits scene of the film (though his full body is not physically shown). At night, Davy Jones enters Will and Elizabeth's house and enters their bedroom where he slowly goes to Will. As Jones raises his claw to attack them, Will awakens but Jones is nowhere to be found. Assuming his appearance to be a nightmare, (Will goes back to sleep holding Elizabeth in his arms,) unaware of the seawater and barnacles left behind under their bed, confirming that Jones is indeed alive.\n\n==Television==\n\n===''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''===\nDavy Jones is mentioned in the episodes [[The Ballad of Badbeard]] and the song [[A-Prime Calypso]].\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[Disney Infinity (series)|Disney Infinity]]''===\n[[File:Davy Jones (Infinity 2).png|250px|left]]\nDavy Jones is a playable character in the video game ''[[Disney Infinity]]''. He is playable in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' playset and in the Toy Box and also serves as the final boss in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' playset. He comes with a sword and a flintlock pistol as his primary weapons.[[File:D06BBF40-63AD-4823-9DC4-FDDD21EEB99B.jpg|thumb|Deleted costume of Davy Jones ]]\n\n===''[[Disney Universe]]''===\n\nThey were going to add Davy Jones in the game and were you\u2019d also had to take down the Flying Dutchman but for some reason it didn\u2019t make the cut and they scrapped out all of those ideas and some characters never got a chance to be in the game and parts of some levels.\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''===\nDavy Jones appears in the latest installment of the series. His role is similar to ''At World's End'', only with him commanding the Kraken. ''[[Organization XIII]]'' attempted to steal his chest, believing it to the Black Box. When he fatally wounds Will, Davy Jones is attacked by [[Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Goofy]] but he manages to get rid of them and is stabbed in the heart before he can kill Sora.\n\n===Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life===\nDavy Jones is to serve as an antagonist within this Sea of Thieves video-game. His motivation as antagonist appearing to be that he opposes the sea of thieves due to it insulting his view of death.\n\n==Printed Media==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow]]''===\nIn young [[Jack Sparrow]]'s teenage adventures, Davy Jones shows interest in the Sword of Cort\u00e9s, also sought by Jack. With the Sword rendered unavailable, Jones set out to find the Timekeeper.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom|The Price of Freedom]]''===\nWhen Jack Sparrow was a young man, Davy Jones helps the Brethren Court to identify the traitor among them. With Jones' help, the traitor is identified as Borya Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea. After [[Cutler Beckett]] sank Jack Sparrow's ship, the ''[[Black Pearl|Wicked Wench]]'', Davy Jones approaches Sparrow for a deal: Jones will raise the ''Wench'' back from the depths, allowing Sparrow to be captain for 13 years if Sparrow agrees to serve aboard the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' for 100 years.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n\n===[[Adventure Isle]]===\nOne of the areas on the pirate-half of this attraction is a subterranean cavern called, \"Davy Jones' Locker\". Said cavern has skull-shaped rock formations, pirate skeletons and an assortment of treasure.\n\n===[[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]===\nIn the Magic Kingdom's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is a mine outside of the town of [[Tumbleweed]] which is called, \"Dave V. Jones Mine\".\n\n===''[[The Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow]]''===\nDavy Jones is only heard taunting Jack Sparrow from aboard the ''Flying Dutchman'' in the attraction.\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===\nIn the original incarnation of Pirates of the Caribbean, Davy Jones was mentioned by the [[Talking Skull|talking skull]] and later the pirate captain of the [[Wicked Wench]] saying, \"''By thunder, we'll see ya to Davy Jones''!\". The latter of this audio was later given to the character of Barbossa when he replaced Blackbeard as captain of the Wicked Wench. The [[Hook Hand Pirate|hook-handed pirate]] threatened [[Isla Tesoro|Puerto Dorado]]'s magistrate [[Carlos (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Carlos]] with, \"A swim with Davy Jones\". Jones is also mentioned by [[Redd]] who states that the [[Auctioneer]] should drown a group of hens he's attempting to sell. The mention of Jones here being in theme with the traditional usage of the name being a euphemism for a watery grave.\n\nAt the end of the Disneyland version of the attraction, Davy Jones' disembodied voice speaks to guests as they are transported from Isla Tesoro in the 18th century to 19th/20th century [[New Orleans]]. This dialogue will switch between that of Jones, and that of Blackbeard's ghost while glowing eyes watch the guest from the shadows. Both undead pirates mention how they will encounter guests when they set sail again and how they narrowly averted death.\n\n====[[2006]]-[[2018]]====\n{{Quote|Ah... They DO tell tales. So says I, Davy Jones.|Davy Jones appearing during the mist waterfall scene|Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)}}\nIn 2006, Davy Jones was placed in the ride as a projection in a waterfall found in a treasure-filled cave of the [[Dead Man's Cove]]. On May [[2011]], to coincide with the release of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]'', [[Blackbeard]] was added to the ride, portrayed by [[Ian McShane]], as a temporary replacement of Davy Jones. In later refurbishments in 2011, projections of Blackbeard and Davy Jones were used alternatively through the ride at [[Disneyland]]; Davy Jones only appeared in [[Tokyo Disneyland]], while Blackbeard only appeared in [[Walt Disney World]].\n\nIn [[2017]], the mist waterfall scene showing either images of Blackbeard or Davy Jones during the scene when the boats are going up a large hill leading to the fort in the Disneyland Paris attraction was added on [[July 24]], 2017 as part of the attraction's reopening when Disney announced that the Paris version would have characters from the film series in June 2017. In [[2018]], the waterfall effect was removed from Disneyland, with the original [[Paul Frees]] audio restored to the tunnel and a new scene of a [[Pirate Robber|cursed skeleton pirate]] and octopus put in the waterfall's place. It is believed that the reasoning behind this change was due to a desire to keep Paul Frees' audio in the ride after his audio as the Auctioneer, Captain and [[The Pooped Pirate|Pooped Pirate]] were removed.\n\n====[[Disneyland Paris]]====\nBlackbeard and Davy Jones still appear on a waterfall in the Disneyland Paris version of Pirates of the Caribbean. Here, they appear while guests' boats travel up a waterfall in the ruins of a fortress on Isla Tesoro rather than within Dead Man's Cove.\n\n===[[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island]]===\nDavy Jones' ghostly voice can be heard within Dead Man's Grotto in this attraction. Encountered within the grotto is the Dead Man's Chest which when touched triggers the voice of Jones to emanate from the chest, giving an ominous warning about the grotto. His voice can also be heard within Pirate's Den in a shipwreck implied to be taken down by the Kraken.\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===\nIn this [[Shanghai Disneyland]] dark ride, Davy Jones possesses a great hoard of sunken treasure at the bottom of the sea, with the attraction's story being focused around Jack trying to steal the said treasure. An animatronic of Davy Jones can be seen playing his pipe organ before he begins the climactic ship battle for the treasure. When Jack has won, he will either let Jack keep his treasure or turn it into a seaweed ruined mess out of spite.\n\n===[[Trader Sam's]]===\nThe menu description for the drink, \"Shipwreck on the Rocks\" reads, \"Have one too many of these and you'll be setting a course for Davy Jones locker\". In the [[Disneyland Hotel]]'s Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar, one of the twin lockets shared by Jones and Calypso is in [[Trader Sam]]'s collection.\n\n===[[World of Color]]===\nOne of the projections used for the waterfall for Pirates of the Caribbean would later be used in World of Color as part of its original Pirates of the Caribbean sequence.\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Before officially casting [[Bill Nighy]] for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', producers also met with [[Jim Broadbent]], Iain Glenn, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Ian McShane]] for the role. McShane would later be cast as [[Blackbeard]] in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]''.\n*While being named after the figure of Davy Jones from nautical folklore, Jones in the films seems to take influence from many different parts of pop-culture:\n**Jones' split tricorn and faustian bargains is inspired by the Devil. Davy Jones is not traditionally affiliated with this sort of behaviour but there is credence to him being seen as a sea-devil/demon.\n**Davy Jones' beard of tentacles gives him a strong resemblance to the appearance of [[wikipedia: Cthulhu|Cthulhu]], a mythical being created by renowned science fiction and horror author {{WikipediaLink|H. P. Lovecraft}}. Both characters are also of great supernatural power, have loyal followings, are comparable to gods, and make their bases at the bottom of the sea.\n**The story of Davy Jones in the film series resembles the slavic fairy-tale character of Koschei the Deathless. Koschei being a sorcerer who carved out his own heart and hid it on an island in an effort to secure his own life. When the heart is obtained by someone, Koschei would become bound as their slave out of fear for them destroying his heart and killing him.\n**Davy Jones is not traditionally affiliated with the Flying Dutchman nor the Kraken in nautical folklore. The captain of the Dutchman is traditionally identified as one ''Hendrick van der Decken'' or ''Barend Fokke''.\n**Jones' supernatural occupation of ferrying the dead clearly is inspired by [[Charon]] from Greco-Roman mythology.\n**Him falling in-love with the sea goddess Calypso is taken from Homer's The Odyssey in which the protagonist [[Ulysses]] falls in love with the goddess and nearly stays at sea with her.\n**Jones' role in the films is inspired by that of [[Jabba the Hutt]] in the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy. Namely in being a powerful sea-creature like entity who the films' supporting rogue made an off-screen bargain with resulting in him being hunted for his debt and captured by a bounty-hunter working for the debtor by the end of the second film. Then the third film opening with the heroes traveling to the desert where the rogue is captive to free them in-order to help fight an evil empire.\n*Davy Jones was originally supposed to have a Dutch accent, as a pun on the name of his ship \"The Flying ''DUTCH''man\", but the British Bill Nighy couldn't do a Dutch accent.\n*In the ''[[Kingdom Hearts series|Kingdom Hearts]]''[[Kingdom Hearts series|series]], Davy Jones is the second person who nearly managed to kill [[Sora]], because when he was going to finish it after knocking him down, he was only stopped when Will stabbed his heart with help from Jack Sparrow.\n*In ''Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life'', Jones' voice is that of a generic Scottish accent rather than a recreation of Bill Nighy's inflection.\n*[[PKNA]] comic issue #42, ''Ulysses' Syndrome'', published six yers before ''Dead Man's Chest'', coincidentally features as the enemy a giant shark named Davy Jones.\n*The reasoning for the Davy Jones reference in Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is unknown.\n**It could be a play on the legend of, \"The Dutchman's Gold\" due to Davy Jones sometimes being affiliated with the Flying Dutchman. The Dutchman's Gold is a story cited by imagineer [[Tony Baxter]] as an inspiration behind the ride, being a story about a dutchman's secret mine which is filled with gold.\n**It might be in reference to Pirates of the Caribbean due to Big Thunder being inspired by the [[Western River Expedition]], a proposed ride which was inspired by Pirates of the Caribbean but which was cancelled in favour of Pirates.\n**The name could be a reference to how the town of Tumbleweed is flooded, hence Davy Jones' mention being a reference to the potential fate of citizens drowning in Tumbleweed.\n*Indirect references to Jones appear in different Disney Parks attractions. The Dead Man's Chest appears in the collection of [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]] in [[RV Oceaneer Lab|Oceaneer Lab]]. A portrait of the Flying Dutchman as it appeared in the Pirates of the Caribbean films is hung in [[Phantom Manor]] as part of [[The Phantom|Henry Ravenswood]]'s collection. The latter of these references is a parallel to how a pre-Pirates of the Caribbean film portrait of the Flying Dutchman is hung in the [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion]].\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:pirates:Davy Jones|Davy Jones]] on [[w:c:pirates:Main Page|Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki]]\n*{{KH|Davy_Jones}}\n\n{{PotCWiki}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{Disney Heroes: Battle Mode}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Davy}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts Bosses]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
