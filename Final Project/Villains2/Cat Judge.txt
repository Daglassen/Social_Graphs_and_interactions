Of course, the trial is rigged in order for the judge to declare Pluto guilty of chasing a kitten and then sentence him to the Hot Seat. Despite this fact, the Cat Judge's fate is never revealed after his disappearance when Pluto awakes from his nightmare.\n\n==Appearance==\nIn the short, the cat judge declares that the jury has seen enough to reach a verdict after multiple witnesses testify against Pluto for his crimes against cats. Without even giving time for thought, the Jury quickly declares Pluto guilty and he is dragged off to meet his fate in the \"hot seat\", much to his complete horror. In the real world, Pluto whimpers in his sleep until a flint from the fireplace jumps unto his behind, waking him up. He crashes into the bucket where Mickey is cleaning the kitten. When he sees it, he becomes terrified and tries to run away, but Mickey insists that they get along. The kitten licks Pluto and he licks back, showing that he has ended his bullying ways.\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Judges]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
