"[[File:EchidnaChildren.jpg|thumb|270px|Echidna and her children]]\n\n'''Typhon and Echidna's Children''' are the most horrifying and vicious monsters of the ancient Greek world. They appeared in the [[Hercules (TV series)|''Hercules'' TV series]]. As the children of [[Echidna]] and [[Typhon]], they are all gifted with incredible strength and they can come in any form or size.\n\n==List of children==\n===Cerberus===\n[[File:CerberusGates.jpg|thumb|Cerberus]]\n{{Main|Cerberus}}\n'''Cerberus''' is a giant three-headed dog who acts as the guardian of the [[Underworld]].  \n[[File:CerberusPup.JPG|thumb|140px|left|Cerberus as a pup]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n\n===Hydra===\n[[File:Hydra.jpg|thumb|left|Hydra]]\n{{Main|Hydra}}\nThe '''Hydra''' is a vicious giant female serpent-like monster that grows multiple heads every time one is chopped off.

He is far larger than the other Cyclopes seen in the series, but his large size and strength is nothing compared to the [[Cyclops]] from the film who allied himself with the [[Titans]].\n{{-}}\n\n===Orthos===\n[[File:Orthos.jpg|thumb|left|Orthos]]\n{{Main|Orthos}}\nOrthos is a lazy two headed cyclops that fought Hercules twice.

[[Nymphs#Sea Nymphs|Sea Nymphs]] work with Gegenius luring sailors to him for him to feed on, in exchange he spares the Sea Nymphs.   \n\n====Trivia====\n* He is based on the [[wikipedia:Gegenees|Gegenees]], 6-armed giants that live on the same island as the Doliones.  They were fought of by Hercules with help from the Argonauts.  \n* He was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] in his 1st appearance, and [[Frank Welker]] in his 2nd appearance.  {{-}}\n\n\n\n{{-}}\n\n===[[Minotaur]]===\n[[File:Minotaur.jpg|thumb|Minotaur]]\n{{Main|Minotaur}}\nThe '''Minotaur''' is a large humanoid bull who enjoyed causing mayhem and destruction in the city of Heraklion, the capital of Crete. When Crete's king Minos finally captured him he requested of Daedalus and Icarus to build a large maze to keep the Minotaur imprisoned. However the insane king only wanted to use the maze for entertainment by throwing innocent people into the maze so they could be hunted by the Minotaur.\n\n====Trivia====\n*[[File:MinotaurBaby.JPG|thumb|left|120px|The Minotaur as an infant]]In the original myth the Minotaur was the stepson of King Minos but in the animated series there is no mention of the two being related.\n*In the film, the Minotaur had red eyes and lacked clothing and facial hair and in the episode ''Hercules and the Parents Weekend'' he had purple skin as an infant (although this may be due to a lack of fur).\n*In the episode ''Hercules and the Bacchanal'', it is implied that there may be more than one Minotaur.\n{{-}}\n\n===Sphinx===\n[[File:Sphinx.jpg|thumb|left|Sphinx]]\nThe '''Sphinx''' is a game-show loving monster who lives high up on a mountain top. Whenever someone trespasses on his domain he forces them to play on his game show and if they answer all his questions right he gives them a fabulous prize but if they get them wrong he eats them.\n\n====Trivia====\n*In the original myths, the Sphinx was female, not male. However this sphinx bears several similarities to its Egyptian counterpart, namely the beard and gender.\n{{-}}\n\n===Caucasian Eagle===\n[[File:CaucasianEagle.JPG|thumb|The Caucasian Eagle]]\nThe '''Caucasian Eagle''' is a giant bird who was ordered by Zeus to eat the liver of the imprisoned Titan [[Prometheus]] every day as punishment for the Titan's disobedience. After so many years together, it seemed that Prometheus and the Eagle had formed an unwanted casual relationship where they would casually talk about how annoying their routine is and how the Eagle has grown bored of eating nothing but Prometheus' liver to the point where he even brought an onion with him to add flavor to it, much to Prometheus' annoyance. When Prometheus was freed by Hercules, Hades transformed the Eagle into a fire bird to subdue him, which the Eagle appreciated as he could now eat the liver fried. In the end, Hercules managed to subdue the Eagle and convince his father to free Prometheus. As a result, he could no longer do his routine with the Titan. He was voiced by the late [[Jerry Stiller]].{{-}}\n\n===Gorgon===\n[[File:Gorgon.JPG|thumb|left|140px|An image of a Gorgon]]\n{{Main|Medusa (Hercules)}}\nAn image of a '''Gorgon''' resembling the one from the film is seen in the episode ''Hercules and the Parents Weekend'' while Echidna is singing about her children. Whether Echidna is the mother of all Gorgons or just this one is unknown. In the film, Hercules fights a gorgon in the [[Zero to Hero]] sequence, and Medusa appears in the animated series as a friend of Hercules, though Hades tries to use Medusa to turn the hero-in-training to stone.\n\n===Arachne===\n'''Arachne''' (voiced by [[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 appears in \"[[Hercules and the Tapestry of Fate]]\" as the guardian of the Tapestry of Fate; a [[spider]]-like monster with a bored, sarcastic personality. She only became a guardian because of her mother saying she should see the world and eat exotic people. When Hercules and Icarus enter the cavern, Arachne attempts to eat Hercules, chewing as though savoring its snack until the hero-in-training opened the spider's jaws. While Hercules was able to escape, Icarus is taken by Arachne's spiderwebs and eaten, which Hercules undid with the Tapestry after defeated the monster. When Hades changed the Tapestry, Arachne was reduced to minding the cave where the Tapestry used to be. During this time, when Hercules visits the Tapestry cave again, Arachne tries to eat him again but her fangs broke after biting the now-godly Hercules, and tells him where the Tapestry is located.\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Eagles]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]"
