He is the secret leader of a gang of [[Weasels]], who tricked [[J. Thaddeus Toad|Toad]] into trading his estate for the motorcar that they had stolen. He is most likely a human version of the Chief Weasel from the original story.\n\nHe was voiced by [[Oliver Wallace]], who also provided the musical score for this film, as well as other Disney animated shorts and feature films of the 1940s and 1950s; some sources, however, state that Alec Harford provided this character's voice.\n\n==Appearances ==\n===''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''===\nWinky is a wily barman who keeps a tavern that the seven of the weasels visit the day Toad decides to try and barter with them for their stolen motorcar. With no money, Toad, playing right into the hands of the sneaky weasels, offers a trade: Toad Hall for the motorcar. Winky signs the drawn-up contract as a witness.\n\nWhen Toad is brought to court, he calls Winky as a witness to corroborate the seemingly-outrageous account of that day, certain that he'll get him off the hook, and even goes so far as to elaborate on his so-called \"unimpeachable honesty\". However, Winky reveals his true colors as he turns traitor on Toad by implicating him for trying to sell him the stolen motorcar. Toad is subsequently sent to prison.\n\nOn Christmas Day, when Toad escapes and rejoins his friends, [[Angus MacBadger]] arrives to tell them that the weasels have gathered at Toad Hall for a raucous party, with their ringleader revealed to be none other than Winky, in possession of the Hall's deed. So, that night, the four friends invade Toad Hall via a secret passage and try to make off with the deed while Winkie and the weasels are in a drunken slumber, ending up as a dangerous chase and game of \"keep away\" between each other. In the end, the friends escape with Toad in possession of the deed.\n\nWhat becomes of Winkie and the weasels is unseen, but it can be theorized that they were most likely arrested and sent to prison after Toad's name was cleared.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]===\nWinky makes an appearance in the classic dark ride when the guests travel through his pub. He holds two spinning beer mugs and ducks down, leaving the mugs spinning in the air.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In French, his name was translated as \"Monsieur Moustache\".\n*Like in other older Disney films, like ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', ''[[Bambi]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'', and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', the final fate of the villains is unseen or unclear and is left to the viewer to theorize or deduce it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nWiw20.png\nWinkie'spub03.jpg|Mr. Winkie in [[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]].\nHjvgjbhjbjbjbghjbghg.jpg\nScreen Shot 2017-03-11 at 7.19.31 PM.png\nMr.Winkie.jpg\nMr.Winkie1.jpg\nMr.Winkie3.jpg\nMr.Winkie pin1.jpg\nMr.Winkie pin2.jpg\nMr.Winkie pin3.jpg\nMr.Winkie5.jpg\nCCI06052021.jpg\nIceraichabodmrtoad1551.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Winkie}}\n[[es:Winkie]]\n[[no:Mr. Winky]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
