She only appears in 2 episodes.\n==Biography==\nEver since Alana got kicked out of Bayside, Bianca took over her role as the mean girl. She was so bad she got kicked out of military school. Ever since she started going to Bayside, she immediately began to torment Raven, her friends, and family even going so far as to follow her home and hit her with dodgeballs.\n\nOne day, during gym, Raven accidentally hits Bianca in the face with a dodgeball (which literally \"knocked the bad out of her\", as Chelsea put it).\n\nShe turns good for a week, but because of that event, her former posse target Raven as their new leader.\n\nShe returned to her old self in the end of the episode after Raven falls on her from a rope.\n\n== Trivia ==\n''Coming Soon!''\n\n== Navigation ==\n{{That's So Raven}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:That's So Raven characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
