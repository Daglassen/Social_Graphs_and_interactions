She bonds quickly to people and will follow them anywhere, even if they speak badly about her. She admires the Phantom Blot. Her tendency to talk out loud to herself comes from working in F.O.W.L's records room for many years. \n\n===Appearance===\nPepper is average height and slender. She wears the standard Egghead uniform: A half cracked egg helmet, a yellow body suit with a red collar and belt, along with red gloves and boots.\n\n==Role in the series==\nPepper was introduced in the Season 3 episode, \"[[The Phantom and the Sorceress!]]\". There, she enters the room where the [[Phantom Blot]] is repairing his broken glove, telling him that he is busy repairing it just before leaving.\n\nPepper later appears in \"[[The Fight for Castle McDuck!]]\", where she and the Phantom Blot plan to steal the Blessed Bagpipe from the McDucks' manor. Pepper discusses with the Blot to steal the Bagpipe in order to accomplish their mission, performing a stealth mission at the McDucks' manor without being noticed by [[Matilda McDuck|Matilda]] and the McDuck family. Pepper and the Blot spy on Huey's guidebook about the Bagpipe just as she takes a picture of the illustration to find the Bagpipe just as Pepper introduces herself to the Blot. Looking at the rainbow blast and the Will-O'-the-Wisps accidentally caused by Louie, Pepper tells the Blot to slow down.\n\nPepper and the Phantom Blot enter the hall of ancestors where the Blessed Bagpipe is at, followed by an argument between Scrooge and the McDuck family and upon seeing one of the statues with the Blessed Bagpipe, Pepper grabs it but falls off, causing the Bagpipe to activate the statues of the McDuck ancestors and just as the McDucks notice what the Phantom Blot and Pepper have done, much to the Blot angrily scolding Pepper for the danger she caused. Furthermore, [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] leads the McDucks to stop F.OW.L. in teamwork to which the plan is paused when the statues of the McDuck ancestors argue over each other just as the argument resumes just as [[Emutilda]], Matilda's pet emu, continues chasing the F.O.W.L. agents across the castle to which while hiding behind one of the statues of the McDuck ancestors just as Pepper discusses with the Blot that she is the only Egghead that F.O.W.L. could volunteer as the other Eggheads think he is a nuisance to the F.O.W.L. agents. As Emutilda runs across the hall, the nephews plan to get the Bagpipe before Pepper and the Phantom Blot steal it. The Blot then saves Pepper from a crumbling part of one of the statues of the McDuck ancestors. Noticing a chandelier below Huey, Dewey, and Louie, the Blot traps them in a plan to accomplish their task. Emutilda charges and grabs the bagpipes in a plan to protect it just as the two agents are still being chased by the mad emu across the hall. In teamwork, the McDucks, including the statues of the McDuck ancestors and Matilda's pet emu, Emutilda, prepare to defeat the F.O.W.L. agents, only for the Bagpipe to revert the statues back to their lifeless forms just as Webby and the nephews work together to protect the Blessed Bagpipe, followed by Downy, Scrooge's mother, telling the agents to leave the McDuck Manor just as the two manage to retreat. Afterwards, the Phantom Blot discusses with Pepper in a plan to take revenge against the McDucks just before the two leave.\n\nIn the series finale, Pepper appears in the Library of Isabella Finch with the rest of the F.O.W.L. members. She is having a discussion with Rockerduck, Phantom Blot, and Steelbeak. When a disguised Webby asks for the directions to the records room, Pepper kindly gives it to her and then rambles on about her years of service in that room.\n\nIt is assumed that she was arrested, along with the other villains, after F.O.W.L.'s defeat.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Pepper}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
