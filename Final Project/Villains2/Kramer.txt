He's evil businessman and scientist [[Dr. Claw]]'s henchman.\n\n==Role in the film==\nKramer first appears in the film. at Sanford Scolex's hideout, Scolex Industries, to which he is testing the new claw hand that Kramer built for him after his left one got crushed by a bowling ball during a police chase with Security Officer John Brown after he killed Artimus Bradford, father of Dr. [[Brenda Bradford]] and broke into their lab. He tells Kramer that he likes the new hand and that he deserves a dashing appellation to which Kramer asks what that is and he says that it's a nickname to which Kramer suggests Santa Claw to which he says that he would like to just be called Claw to which Kramer refers to him as Mr. Claw and shows him some other hands he has made for him such as the opera one and the chopsticks one since he likes Japanese food. Then Kramer examines the robotic foot that Scolex and [[Sykes (Inspector Gadget)|Sykes]] stole from the Bradfords' Lab and tells Scolex that it's very interesting. After this they also try to test out Artimus' science hat that was also stolen from there but when Scolex puts it on and Kramer tries to turn it on nothing happens so Scolex has Sykes  put it on and has Kramer to turn him on maximum voltage to which he does and causes Sykes to go crazy. A few days later Kramer builds a clone of John Brown/Inspector Gadget called [[RoboGadget]] for Scolex so he can send it out to destroy the world, set John Brown/Inspector Gadget up, and win Brenda's heart to which Kramer tells him that it might not work without a chip to which he shows him that he made one and puts it in to which RoboGadget comes to life and Scolex sends him to destroy Riverton. Shortly afterward Scolex, Kramer, and Sykes capture the real-life John Brown/Inspector Gadget who had secretly snuck into the lab to retrieve the stolen foot and reveal to him his evil clone on TV to which he asks them why they are doing this to which Kramer says to make teachers to which Scolex tells him to shut up and orders him to remove Gadget's chip or else he'll be building himself a new head to which he tries to but faints while doing so. Scolex does so and orders Sykes to dump Gadget in the junkyard to which Sykes thinks he means Kramer but he corrects him by saying he means Gadget. Kramer doesn't appear throughout the rest of the film, but according to the junior novelization, it is stated that instead of going to jail for his involvement with Scolex's plans, he spent many long weeks in the hospital and was told by his doctors to get some serious rest.\n\n{{Inspector Gadget}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Inspector Gadget characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"
