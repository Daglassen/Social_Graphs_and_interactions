Mei is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
After the Divine Beast Vah Ruta had started its rampage, Mei went fishing in Zora River as if everything was normal. The Divine Beast's rage caused the water to swell and swept her downstream to Lake Hylia.
Mei can be found on one of the islands off the coast of Hylia Island in Lake Hylia, catching Fish to sell at the Coral Reef General Store in Zora's Domain. She is aware of being far away from the Domain but since there are lots of rare Fish to catch at the Lake she is enjoying herself.
When Link is sent by Mei's husband Fronk to find her in the Side Quest "A Wife Washed Away", Link goes to Lake Hylia after instructed by Fronk that Mei could have been carried downstream there. Mei tells Link that they got a big haul today and that fishing is so much fun. After Link asks Mei if she knows Fronk, the Zora woman says he is her darling and love and asks if something is wrong. Once Link explains, Mei cries out and exclaims that she is sorry as she completely forgot and got carried away. Realizing she has to get back home right away, Mei gives Link five Staminoka Bass and hurries to Zora's Domain. This completes the Side Quest.
Upon returning to Zora's Domain, Mei can be found swimming in a pool of water fed by a waterfall. She tells Link that her darling gave her a good scolding and said she should not go wandering about anymore for a while, although she supposes that is only fair. Despite being bored because of this, Mei is happy that her darling is looking after the kids for the day, so all she has to worry about is having fun and being fancy-free. Mei wants to work, but since she gave her darling such a scare she will let him take care of things for a while and try to take it easy.
