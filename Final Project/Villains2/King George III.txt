"{{Infobox character\n|name = King George III\n|films = ''[[Hamilton]]''\n|actor = [[Jonathan Groff]]\n|inspiration = [[wikipedia:George III of the United Kingdom|The notorious king of the same name]]\n|image = Hamilton (8).jpg\n|occupation = King of Great Britain and Ireland\n|home = Windsor Castle, Windsor, [[England]]\n|status = Active\n}}\n\n'''King George III''' is a major antagonist featured in the [[2020]] film ''[[Hamilton]]'' as the King of Great Britain who believed that the Colonies would not be successful in their revolution.\n\n==Appearance==\nAfter [[Alexander Hamilton]] argues with Samuel Seabury, (\u201cFarmer Refuted\u201d) the ensemble sings that a message from the king will arrive shortly. Sure enough, King George III shows a strong assumption that he will win the Revolutionary War (\"You'll Be Back\").\n\nHowever, following America's success, the king becomes rather irritated and sad, saying that America cheated on England with France and that he is now fighting with France and with Spain, referring to the [[wikipedia:Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and [[wikipedia:Anglo-Spanish War (1796\u20131808)|Anglo-Spanish War]] respectively. (\"What Comes Next?\").\n\nOnce [[George Washington]] steps down, King George learns of this and questions who might replace him. A soldier brings news that John Adams, will be Washington's replacement, and the king recalls having met him years ago in 1785, believing him to be a \"little guy\" that the Americans will eat alive. Musingly anticipating Adams' presidency, King George wishes him luck (\"I Know Him\"). \n\nWhile King George does not sing again, during \u201cThe Reynolds Pamphlet,\u201d the king jeers at Alexander Hamilton alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]] and James Madison. The three of them throw pieces of paper around the stage and mock Hamilton.\n\nThe songs of George III are widely considered as light comic relief but each one has a purpose in setting the scene for the next section of the show and phase of Hamilton\u2019s life. He first appears after the characters have been introduced, to threaten the colonies. This introduces the Revolutionary War which highlights Hamilton as the military man and concludes with \u201cThe Battle of Yorktown\u201d. He then re-appears to give warning about the political difficulties he believes the new nation will face post-independence. This precedes the next section where military battles are replaced by political battles and Washington declares \u201cWinning was easy... governing\u2019s harder\u201d. In this section the audience sees Hamilton the politician. King George\u2019s final appearance is to offer grudging respect for Washington and to mock his replacement John Adams, introducing a period of chaos for Hamilton beginning with \u201cThe Adams Administration\u201d. This is where the audience witnesses his decline.\n\nKing George III is perceived in the show to be insane, claiming that \"When push comes to shove, I will kill your friends and family, to remind you of my love.\u201d In fact, the king did suffer bouts of insanity which many have claimed to have been porphyria, and some say that his medicine, which contained large amounts of arsenic, worsened his condition. <ref>https://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Spring10/king.cfm</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*On the death of his father in 1751, George III became the heir to the throne, which he succeeded from his grandfather, George II in 1760.\n*George III was the third Hanoverian Monarch, and the first one to be born in England as well as to use English as his first language.\n*Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was the wife of King George III, whom he loved ardently and was loyal and devoted to her.\n*In all, they had 15 children.
