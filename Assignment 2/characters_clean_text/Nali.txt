Nali is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Nali is a Gerudo who can be found in the center of Gerudo Town. Nali sometimes talks with Pritana, who says she cannot believe that Riju's Thunder Helm was stolen by thieves. Nali replies that the Thunder Helm is a helmet that was Lady Urbosa's favorite and explains that it has been passed from chief to chief for generations. Pritana feels sorry for Riju and Nali comments that she heard the thieves are professional assassins. Pritana reasons that this must be why the barracks have been more noisy lately.
If Link speaks to Nali while Pritana is not around, she comments that it is strange to see a tourist as of late, explaining that the Divine Beast Vah Naboris has been deterring outsiders. Nali wishes there were more "brave vai" like Link. Nali also sometimes walks around near the Shops in the center of Gerudo Town in search of Mighty Bananas. If Link asks about Mighty Bananas, Nali explains that Mighty Bananas are full of protein and calories and that eating them grants power. Nali says that they are always available at the Kara Kara Bazaar, but she does not know how to Sand-Seal Surf. Nali also tells a rumor of a tribe that eats nothing but Mighty Bananas, which depletes the stock of them in the Gerudo Desert.
