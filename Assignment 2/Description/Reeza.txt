If [[Link]] speaks to Reeza, she says that [[Riju]], Chief of the Gerudo, is a kind person for allowing visitors during these tough times.<ref>{{Cite|Sav'aaq. The {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}} may be young, but she's a kind person who puts her people first.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|She told me to allow visitors though, even in these tough times...|Reeza|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Even in these tough times, the chief won't let any of her official duties slide, including things that feel unimportant.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|She's instructed me to go ahead and let people who wish to speak with her come in, regardless of subject matter...|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about the tough times she is referring to, Reeza snaps at Link that it is a Gerudo problem and is none of his business.<ref>{{Cite|This is a Gerudo problem! It is none of your concern!|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> Reeza allows Link into the palace, but warns him not to get in the Chief's way.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, listen! Even though I'm letting you inside, that doesn't mean you can go getting in the {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}}'s way! Watch out!|Reeza|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|So you may enter, but with a word of warning. Do not get in the {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}}'s way!|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> When Link ends the conversation, Reeza tells Link not to be rude to Riju.<ref>{{Cite|Take care not to be rude.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Reeza after speaking to Riju for the first time, she asks what makes Link so special that Riju trusts him to retrieve the [[Thunder Helm]].<ref>{{Cite|What makes you so special that the {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}} would trust you with retrieving the {{Color|BotW Red|Thunder Helm}}?|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> She then warns him that the task is not simple,<ref>{{Cite|Hrmph. Regardless, I hope you are prepared. This task will not be a simple one.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> as the skilled [[Yiga|thieves]] slipped past all of the guards.<ref>{{Cite|The thieves were able to slip past all of our guards, so they're certainly not amateurs.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> Reeza recommends that Link goes to the barracks to learn more,<ref>{{Cite|You should head over to the {{Color|BotW Blue|barracks}} if you want to learn more...|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> as the soldiers have been investigating the theft.<ref>{{Cite|The soldiers there have been investigating the theft for a while, so they should be able to help.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter Link calms Naboris, Reeza talks about how much it stressed Riju and [[Buliara]].<ref>{{Cite|When the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} first appeared, a day didn't go by that the {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|Buliara}} didn't look stressed.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> She thanks Link for lifting that burden from them.<ref>{{Cite|But now... Well, it's like years have been lifted from them. This is all thanks to you.|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks her to talk about Riju, she snaps at Link, demanding he call her by her full title, Lady Riju.<ref>{{Cite|Hey! Treat her with due respect and call her Lady Riju. Her youth doesn't stop her from looking out for her people!|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> She goes on to explain that Riju has a softer side,<ref>{{Cite|She puts up a tough front most of the time, but she does have a softer side, too...|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> but can only let it show in private due to her expectations of leadership.<ref>{{Cite|With all expectations of leadership, though, she can only let that side show when she's in private...|Reeza|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks her to talk about Buliara, Reeza is offended that Link does not know about her.<ref>{{Cite|\"Tell me about Buliara\"?!
