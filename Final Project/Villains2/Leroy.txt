'''Experiment 629''', is an illegal genetic experiment and the last known experiment to be created by [[Jumba Jookiba]]. He appears as the titular secondary antagonist of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[2006]] television film ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''. [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] forced Jumba to create Leroy and design him as an improved version of [[Stitch]] with extra destructive capabilities and less fluffy. Thus, H\u00e4msterviel could use Leroy to take control of the Galactic Federation and finally capture all of the other experiments. Leroy is an unstoppable monster. His one true place is in [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]].\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nLeroy is an antagonistic, conceited, and ruthless experiment created to serve as H\u00e4msterviel's enforcer, and thus obeys the scientist without question. Despite his loyalty to H\u00e4msterviel, Leroy enjoys seeing him suffer, as he is shown laughing at H\u00e4msterviel when the latter falls to the ground after their cannon is destroyed. Nevertheless, he is completely loyal to H\u00e4msterviel, as he never once tried to betray him.\n\nLike Stitch, Leroy is shown to be very destructive, but in a more vicious than mischievous way. He is also shown to be a physical, sadistic, cruel, and disgusting slob. Despite this, he also possesses some of Stitch's habits, including holding soda cans in his mouth, picking his nose with his tongue, and sharing Stitch's love for [[Elvis Presley]]'s music, as Leroy and [[Leroy Clones|his clones]] were dancing to \"[[Jailhouse Rock]]\" in their prison cells.\n\nLeroy is cunning and quite mischievous like Stitch, though he isn't quite as immature despite the \"age\" difference. Where the similarities end in Leroy is how brutal he is in comparison to Stitch. Leroy isn't above using violence to get things accomplished and enjoys tormenting his foes whenever possible. He will more often than not rely on brute force in battle and tends to not show mercy to his opponents. While he does rely on brute force, Leroy is capable of planning out his attacks and is quite smart. While his English isn't perfect, Leroy can speak it a bit better than most other experiments.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nLeroy resembles an exact duplicate of Stitch with rougher, red fur, a mahogany nose, black claws, toes, tips of antennae and ears and back markings, a light tan/pinkish-orange stomach from his chin down and around his eyes, crimson markings on the back of his head and on his back, frilly ears with light purple inside, yellow teeth, black eyes, a fluffy tail, three tufts of sharp fur on top of his head and on his chest, and a slightly deeper voice. Leroy also has two extra, retractable arms, two bent white and very dark mahogany tipped retractable antennaes on his head, three bent retractable spines tipped with white and a very dark mahogany on his back, and retractable claws on his front and back paws. When his mouth is closed, his canine fangs stick out. (Note: Leroy can be considered as Experiment 629, as he was the 629th experiment created.)\n\nWhen impersonating Stitch, Leroy dons the same black spacesuit when Stitch wore when he was the captain of the [[B.R.B. 9000]]. Leroy's suit is a black shirt with thick red brims on his shoulders, wrist-length sleeves with red cuffs, along with matching vertical linings on both sides of the shirt and trousers. He also wore a gray belt with a light gray \"V\" on the front, along with a small gray mark on the upper left chest that resembles a tear drop with a black dot on it. After Leroy and his clones were defeated, the suit was removed.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nLeroy possesses all of the same powers as Stitch, with a little extra boost of strength and speed. He can curl into a ball and roll with incredible speed, dealing heavy damage to anything he hits. He is incredibly durable, being immune to fire, bullets, electricity, and other hazards. He is also smart, faster than a supercomputer, and can absorb electric and fire powers. He is normally very physical, but also good with a plasma gun. Leroy also has the ability to disguise himself as Stitch by changing his fur color from red to blue and can instantly regrow his fur. Leroy is also immune to some of the other experiments' powers, since he is created after [[Angel]], her song has no affect him.\n\n===Weaknesses===\nDuring his creation, Leroy was programmed with a fail-safe that causes him and his clones to shut down when they hear the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\".\n\nLike Stitch, Leroy isn't immune to all the other experiments' powers, evident as some of his clones are affected by [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]] and [[Babyfier]].\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Leroy shares Stitch's weakness of water.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nExperiment 629 was the 629th and last genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to have all of [[Stitch]]'s powers, with a little extra boost of strength and speed. He was named Leroy by Dr. H\u00e4msterviel.\n\nWhile spending a few years on Earth, Jumba had an unfinished experiment at his [[Jumba's Lab|laboratory]] in deep space. After [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and Stitch had successfully captured all [[Experiments|625 experiments]] and turned them from bad to good, Jumba regained access to his lab. During this time, Jumba's evil former partner [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel]] escaped [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]] with [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]'s help.\n\nJumba started creating an experiment with explosive saliva from a template similar to Stitch until he was ordered by H\u00e4msterviel, who paid Jumba a visit, to instead make the latter \"a new version of 626.\" Forced to comply after being threatened by Gantu, Jumba created a red, destructive replica of Stitch, and H\u00e4msterviel named him Leroy (much to Jumba and Gantu's amusement).\n\nShortly after, Stitch attacked the lab to apprehend H\u00e4msterviel, and Leroy was released to battle Stitch. After a long fight ensued between the twin experiments, Stitch eventually had Leroy pinned down, but [[Pleakley]]'s untimely arrival distracted Stitch long enough for Leroy to bat him into a containment orb.\n\nAfter Leroy proved to be more powerful than Stitch (although he technically didn't win fairly), the former was [[Leroy Clones|cloned]] by H\u00e4msterviel into a huge army. The original Leroy then took over the [[B.R.B. 9000|B.R.B.]] by posing as Stitch, the captain, and ordered that the [[Galactic Armada|pilots]] take him, H\u00e4msterviel, and the Leroy army to [[Planet Turo|Turo]].\n\nEn route, Leroy received a call from Lilo and, resuming his Stitch disguise, attempted to pose as Stitch. However, he was quickly discovered by Lilo to be an impostor, as he was not wearing the [[Stitch's Necklace|tiki necklace]] that she had given Stitch, causing H\u00e4msterviel to order Leroy to \"hang up\" (namely by blasting the communicator).\n\nMeanwhile, a Leroy clone arrived on Earth, where with Lilo's stolen cousins album, he rounded up all of the first 624 experiments there (along with [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] while capturing [[Gigi]]) and brought them to a stadium to be destroyed.\n\nUpon arriving on planet Turo, the Leroy army was able to overthrow the council and gain galactic domination.\n\nShortly after, H\u00e4msterviel and the entire Leroy army arrived at the stadium on Earth in the B.R.B. to destroy the captured experiments. Before they could, however, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, [[Reuben]], and a reformed Gantu arrived, and a battle ensued between the experiments and the Leroy clones.\n\nThough the experiments were able to overpower the Leroys at first, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand. However, as the Leroys came close to winning the battle, Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused all the Leroys (including the original one) to shut down due to the original's fail-safe.\n\nAfterwards, all of the Leroys, along with H\u00e4msterviel, were sent to prison on Asteroid K-37, where they were seen happily dancing to the song \"[[Jailhouse Rock]]\" with an angry Dr. H\u00e4msterviel tapping his foot.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Until June [[2020]], Leroy was not officially called Experiment 629. Prior to this month, in promotional material for the film and on some [[Japan]]ese and [[Disneyland Paris]] merchandise, Leroy was also referred to as '''Experiment 628''', although this number was not used for his initial appearance in either the Japanese or global versions of ''[[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|Disney Tsum Tsum]]''. Regardless, Leroy being X-628 is false, as he was only called Leroy in the film and is the evil doppelganger of Experiment 626. Also, the real Experiment 628 (albeit in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form) was shown in the episode \"[[627 (episode)|627]]\".\n**Leroy was officially referred to in media as Experiment 629 on [[June 4]], 2020, via a special side story of the manga ''[[Stitch & the Samurai]]'' that was released exclusively via the Japanese version of ''LINE: Disney Tsum Tsum''.<ref>[https://twitter.com/LINE_tsumtsum_j/status/1268422230498828288 Tweet from the Japanese ''LINE: Disney Tsum Tsum'' account written on June 4, 2020.]</ref> In the manga, a caption box appears under Leroy, referring to him as \"\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1629\u30eb\u30ed\u30a4\" or \"Prototype 629 Leroy\". (\"Prototype\", written as \u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1, is [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|the franchise]]'s Japanese terminology for \"Experiment\"; \u30eb\u30ed\u30a4 translates to Leroy.)\n*Leroy is the only experiment to have not been created by Jumba out of his own free will, as H\u00e4msterviel forced him to create the experiment, though he had originally intended Leroy to be a different experiment.\n*Technically speaking, he is the youngest of all the known experiments, having only come into existence during the events of ''Leroy & Stitch''.\n*H\u00e4msterviel wanted Leroy's fur color to be red instead of blue so as to match his cape, and that he doesn't like the color blue.\n**Ironically, Leroy can change his fur color to look like Stitch's.\n**It is unknown if he can change his fur color to other colors.\n*Leroy's color scheme and attitude seem to be derived from [[627|Experiment 627]]. Much like 627, Leroy could not be rehabilitated.\n**627 was suggested as a name by Jumba before Gantu reminded him that 627 was already created.\n*Leroy is one of the ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], and [[Shrink]].\n*When H\u00e4msterviel christened the newly-created experiment Leroy, everyone, for whatever reason, laughed at the name except Lilo, who thought Leroy was a fine name.\n**H\u00e4msterviel tried to name him Spike, Kixx, Slugger, and Cannonball but they were already taken.\n*Leroy is the third experiment shown to share Stitch's habit of picking his nose with his tongue, the first being [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]] and the second being [[Angel]].\n*Although he is the secondary antagonist, Leroy turned out to be more dangerous than H\u00e4msterviel.\n*According to the DVD scene selection, Leroy has about 50,000 clones.\n*The scene where a [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clone]] crash lands on Earth in [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]]'s backyard is the same animation when Stitch first crash landed on Earth in ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''.\n*When Leroy was defeated, his eyes glowed green as Stitch's eyes did in ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''.\n*Leroy can be considered to be one of the only successful prototypes for Jumba's \"ultimate monster\" experiment, since Jumba deliberately programmed Leroy's weakness to the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", and no actual failure has been observed. Other notable attempts for such a prototype experiment are [[Cyber|000]], [[Ace|262]], [[Woops|600]], [[Reuben|625]], 626, and 627, and each failed for its own reason: 000 is uncontrollable, 262 is good, 600 is clumsy, 625 is lazy, 626 wanted a family, and 627 is weak to laughter.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[pt-br:Leroy (Leroy & Stitch)]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]"
