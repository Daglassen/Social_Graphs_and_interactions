He is the president of Condor Studios, the production company for\u00a0''[[So Random!]]''\u00a0and\u00a0''[[Mackenzie Falls]]''.\n\n==History==\nEverybody in Condor Studios go out of their way to please him, for Mr. Condor has the ability to fire everyone in the studio, and is notorious for canceling the show of any person who annoys him. He believes that his daughter is an angel and is extremely protective of her. He also seems to favor\u00a0[[Sonny Munroe|Sonny]], shown he believed her lie in \"Sonny and the Studio Brat\" and even paid\u00a0[[Joy Bitterman]]\u00a0to make the cast of\u00a0''So Random!''\u00a0and\u00a0''Mackenzie Falls''\u00a0go on a camping trip for the summer in \"The Legend of Candy Face\". He can be rather ruthless, as evidenced in one episode in which he told someone over the phone to steal a man's dog which he later gave to his daughter. In \"The Problem with Pauly,\" he seems to be a fan of Pauly. In that same episode (The Problem With Pauly) he said that his first wife was called Tawni. In the episode \"Sonny With a Grant\", [[Chad Dylan Cooper|Chad]] made a list of things he wanted from Mr. Condor, at first, Mr. Condor agrees. Later when Chad begins to become more greedy, Mr. Condor says no then fires Chad and hires\u00a0[[Grant Mitchell]] to play Mackenzie. Of course, Chad regains his role as Mackenzie.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Condor, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
