Aliza is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Aliza is a resident of Outskirt Stable and can be found standing beneath a large Tree just east of the Stable that she refers to as sacred. There she diligently waits to meet the hero of legend, whom she is smitten with. Until Link speaks with her, she will stand beneath the Tree regardless of Weather or Time of day. If Link approaches her, she will preemptively speak to him.
When Link first speaks with Aliza, she initially believes him to be the legendary hero. However, regardless if Link confirms or denies this, she will backtrack on her assertion and doubt his status. Aliza states that the hero of legend is characterized by carrying the Legendary Sword on his back. Even if Link tries to stop talking to her without acknowledging her belief, she tells Link that if he ever meets the hero to send him her way.
Upon hearing Aliza's request, Link receives the "My Hero" Side Quest, prompting him to return to Aliza once he has found the aforementioned Legendary Sword. Link can further interrogate Aliza about the "legendary hero" and the Sword. If Link inquires about the Master Sword, she will inform him that the stories she heard of it say that it was put to rest in a Forest, awaiting its owner's return.
After acquiring the Master Sword, Link can return to Aliza and state his status as the Hero of Hyrule. Upon seeing the Master Sword, she acknowledges Link as the Hero and rewards him with a Star Fragment. Though Aliza is truly excited about meeting Link, her mood completely drops after rewarding their encounter, having lost her excitement over meeting him. If Link talks to Aliza later on, she scolds Link for talking to random strangers, insisting that he should be out doing his job.
