== Biography ==
On the side of the Fashion Passion Armor Shop in Gerudo Town, Link will find a closed, wooden door. If he attempts to open it, he will receive the Side Quest, "The Secret Club's Secret" and hear the Gerudo Greta speaking, who requires a password for entry. If Link guesses the password wrong, he will not be able to try again until the next day. Greta will then tell Link to go drink milk in the bar as a way to tell him to go away. Once Link provides the correct password to Greta, he is allowed entry to the Gerudo Secret Club. Upon entering and speaking to Greta, she notices that she has not seen Link before. Greta comments that Link is a rare visitor and promises not to ask any questions if he does the same. Greta then accepts Link as a member to the Club and the Side Quest is completed.
If Link speaks to Greta, she comments that it is always "good evening" in the Gerudo Secret Club. If Link asks what the place is, she explains that it is the Gerudo Secret Club, or "GSC" for short. Greta sells the Desert Voe Set and the Radiant Set and tells Link that it is the only Shop in Gerudo Town that sells men's clothing. She also explains that while it is illegal to sell men's clothing in Gerudo Town, there is a high demand for it. Greta comments that she has never seen a man disguise himself as a woman like Link has, mentioning that they both have something to hide and suggests they move on to business. She also says that she has not been in sunlight for years. If Link ends the conversation, Greta asks if Link has ever noticed how beautiful light is in the dark. When examining the Radiant Set, Greta will tell Link that it is made using Luminous Stones. She then informs Link that he must also trade her Luminous Stones when buying the Set.
