He was first introduced in the ''Star Wars: Jedi of the Republic\u2014Mace Windu'' comic series.\n\nDibs was a Miraluka Jedi Master who saw with the Force, due to his species being born without eyes. He is known for being greatly insightful and sharp-witted. For this reason, he was selected by [[Mace Windu]] to be part of a team of Jedi on a mission to stop the Separatist operations on the planet Hissrich.\n\nHowever, during the mission, Dibs became disillusioned with the [[Jedi Order]] due to his doubts about whether they should be fighting in the war in the first place and the loss of multiple indigenous inhabitants. This eventually leads him to turn on Windu, engaging him in a lightsaber duel which Prosset loses. He then gets arrested for treason.\n\nAfter the Great Jedi Purge, Dibs joined the [[Galactic Empire]], becoming an inquisitor known as the '''Tenth Brother'''. He was later killed by Purge Troopers.\n\n==Background==\n===Powers and Abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''[[The Force|Power of the Force]]:''' Dibs has a very strong connection to the Force, being one of the most powerful Force-users of his time.\n**'''Force Sense:''' Dibs can sense another sentient being's emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users.
