From their ruins, a new universe shall be forged, in the fire of the stones of reality, and space. All life remade in our image, in steel, free from the sins of flesh. We are Ultron-Sigma. We are your God.|Ultron-Sigma, story mode, ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''}}\n\n'''Ultron-Sigma''' is the main antagonist of the [[Capcom]] crossover fighting game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''. It is the result of a fusion between [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Ultron]] and [[w:c:megaman:Sigma|Sigma]] from Capcom's ''[[w:c:megaman:Mega Man X (series)|Mega Man X]]'' series by using the Space and Reality [[Infinity Stones]]. Their goal was to merge the worlds of Marvel and Capcom and to destroy all organic life on the merged world by unleashing a cybernetic virus, and then rule the new world. Ultron-Sigma would eventually evolve into their ultimate, final form, named '''Ultron Omega''', after using the Space and Reality Stones, along with the Soul Stone, since they have no soul, which drove them insane, and allowed the heroes to destroy them.\n\n==Role in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''==\n[[w:c:marvel:Death|Death]] is visited by [[w:c:darkstalkers:Jedah Dohma|Jedah Dohma]], who proposes an alliance to achieve equilibrium between life and death on both their worlds. Needing the six [[Infinity Stones]] to do so, Death deceives [[Thanos]] and [[Ultron]] into aiding her, granting Thanos the Space Stone and sending Ultron to retrieve the Reality Stone from [[w:c:megaman:Abel City|Abel City]]. [[w:c:megaman:Sigma|Sigma]] intercepts Ultron, and the two forge an alliance. They betray the others and use the Space and Reality Stones to merge the two dimensions and fuse themselves into a single being named \"Ultron-Sigma\". In order to wipe out biological life, they proceed to unleash an evolved form of the cybernetic Sigma virus that turns organic creatures to synthetic beings under their control. In an effort to stop him, teams of heroes from both worlds are dispatched to find the other four Infinity Stones.\n\nAfter gathering the remaining four Infinity Stones, [[w:c:megaman:Doctor Thomas Light|Doctor Light]], [[Iron Man]], [[w:c:capcom:Rad Spencer|Spencer]], and [[Hawkeye]] build a weapon to harness the Infinity Stones, but during the process, Ultron-Sigma attacks Avengers Tower. In the carnage, Thanos is released and attacks Ultron-Sigma, cracking the Reality Stone and forcing him to retreat. As [[w:c:residentevil:Chris Redfield|Chris Redfield]]\u2019s team is pursued by [[w:c:darkstalkers:Jedah Dohma|Jedah Dohma]]'s Symbiote, the heroes return to repel it. They use their Stones to destroy the Symbiote and the falling core, but are infected in the process. With hours left until they are turned, the heroes head for [[Asgard|Xgard]]. While one group distracts Ultron-Sigma, the rest infiltrate Sigma\u2019s laboratory to finish their weapon, the Infinity Buster. When Thanos learns of Death and Jedah\u2019s partnership, he becomes enraged and betrays the heroes, creating a mechanized gauntlet that absorbs [[w:c:streetfighter:Ryu|Ryu]]\u2019s [[w:c:streetfighter:Satsui no Hado|Satsui no Hado]] before departing. [[w:c:devilmaycry:Dante|Dante]] returns to the Dark Kingdom and reclaims the Soul Stone from Jedah. He arrives in Xgard and pretends to surrender the Stone, but because they have no souls, Ultron Sigma is overwhelmed by the Stone and is transformed into Ultron Omega. The Soul Stone purges the Sigma virus within [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], returning him to normal. The others appear and install the Infinity Buster into [[w:c:megaman:Mega Man X (character)|Mega Man X]], who uses it to destroy Ultron Omega.\n\nIn the aftermath, the virus is neutralized, but because the Reality Stone was cracked, the universes cannot be separated again. The heroes agree to protect the new world and split the Infinity Stones between them to keep them safe.\n\n==Standard form: powers, abilities, and gameplay==\nAs a fusion between Ultron and Sigma, and the Infinity Stones (the Reality and Space Stones) that they held, Ultron-Sigma obtained both of their powers and abilities. In regards to gameplay, Ultron-Sigma retains most of Ultron's original move set, with Sigma's teleportation ability and swordsmanship in the mix. Its Hyper Combos are the exact same as Ultron's, with the addition of an extra Level 3 Hyper Combo that allows Ultron-Sigma to summon a powerful meteor shower at will. With power over Space and Reality, Ultron-Sigma is nigh omnipotent.\n\nHowever, Ultron-Sigma's only weaknesses are:\n*Being electrified, just like all other machines.\n*The Reality Stone inside the fused machine being cracked, almost allowing Ultron-Sigma to be separated back to Ultron and Sigma. This is seen when Thanos cracks the Reality Stone on Ultron-Sigma's head, allowing the fused robot to feel pain for the first time. To prevent the Reality Stone from cracking further, Ultron Sigma must recover the Stone's crack carefully and prevent it from being shattered.\n*Due to not having a noble soul and willpower (or any soul at all), Ultron-Sigma becomes completely weak to the Soul Stone. Not only does the Soul Stone transform Ultron-Sigma into the ultimate abomination, Ultron Omega, it also nullified the fused robot's pain suppression and drove them to insanity. The Soul Stone also negated the Sigma virus, causing Sigma, who is immortal by that virus, to become mortal.\n\nUltron-Sigma's Hyper Combos in his standard form include:\n\n*'''Destruction Wave''': Ultron-Sigma charges his hands saying then fires two large and powerful versions of his Death Ray beams in diagonal directions, piercing the opponent. (Level 1 hyper combo)\n*'''Meteor Shower''': Ultron-Sigma uses the powers of the two Space and Reality Infinity Stones to summon a powerful meteor shower to attack the player's character. (Level 3 hyper combo)\n\n==Final form: Ultron Omega==\n{{Quote|We cannot be destroyed! We are perfect! WE ARE ULTRON OMEGA!!!!!|Ultron Omega, in Story Mode, after being transformed from Ultron-Sigma into Ultron Omega by using the Soul Stone}} \n[[File:MVCI Ultron Omega.jpg|thumb|Ultron Omega, the second and final form of Ultron-Sigma, and the final boss of ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''.]]\n'''Ultron Omega''' is the final boss of ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''. It is the second and final form of Ultron-Sigma. This form was created when [[w:c:devilmaycry:Dante|Dante]] acquired the Soul Stone, and it showed him that even with four [[Infinity Stones]], he and the others still could not beat Ultron-Sigma, so he opted to go rogue and do it his own way. Dante shows up for the final battle and actually outsmarts and tricks Ultron-Sigma into using the Soul Stone, which Dante handed over to him prior. When Ultron-Sigma attempts to use it to enslave his enemies, his fusion became more unstable, as Dante informs him that only a noble soul can use the Soul Stone, and that he, Ultron-Sigma, has no soul, which means that he cannot use the Soul Stone properly. Ultron-Sigma then used the full power of the Soul Stone in conjunction with the other two stones already in their possession and mutated into Ultron Omega, due to the Soul Stone destroying his original body and becoming insane. This ultimately cured the Sigma Virus and removed Ultron-Sigma's immortality, which allowed the heroes to use the Infinity Buster to finally destroy the fused villains for good.\n\n===Appearance===\nUltron Omega is the upper half of Ultron (in the form of Ultron-Sigma) attached to the head of Sigma, akin to ''[[w:c:megaman:Mega Man X5|Mega Man X5]]'', with four floating hands: two claws and two fists. Sigma's head, which is slightly damaged, holds the Space Stone on its forehead and a cannon inside its mouth.\n\n===Gameplay===\nUltron Omega is an unplayable boss that works similar to how [[Galactus]] works in ''[[w:c:marvelvscapcom:Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds|Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'' and [[w:c:marvelvscapcom:Abyss|Abyss]] works in ''[[w:c:marvelvscapcom:Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]'', in which it is a giant boss that has its own part of the screen to itself and has its own health bar as Galactus, and is permanently unplayable as Abyss.\n\nUltron Omega occasionally summons [[Ultron Sentries|Ultron Drones]], and will sometimes back out and summon more Ultron Drones, during which it will regenerate vitality. Ultron Omega retains possession of the Reality and Space [[Infinity Stones]], which it can use alternatively. Once one of the Infinity Stone's Infinity Storm is used, it switches to the other Stone and back. Ultron Omega can fire three tracking projectiles when in possession of the Reality Stone instead of one. The Ultron half can also throw its claws at the player, as well as attack with a flurry of energy beams from its palms. When enough damage is dealt, Ultron Omega will throw his hands in front of his head to block damage. The player must attack his hands enough to force him into a stun state where he takes triple damage.\n\nUltron Omega's Hyper Combos include:\n*Firing Sigma's blaster out of its mouth (level 1 hyper combo).\n*Grabbing the player, and trapping them in a paralysis bubble, during which Ultron Omega's fists and claws attack them, slam the opponent into the ground, and then finish them off with a downward attack by Ultron's claws, similar to [[Wolverine]]'s Drill Claw special move (level 1 hyper combo).\n*An enhanced version of his Level 1 blast attack, in which both Infinity Stones are used to channel a powerful beam of energy that can deal major damage to the player's health bar (level 3 hyper combo).\n \n==Trivia==\n*Ultron-Sigma is the second original antagonist for the ''Marvel vs. Capcom'' series, behind [[w:c:marvelvscapcom:Abyss|Abyss]], but it is the first fusion of playable characters in the series.\n*This is not the first time that Ultron has fused with another character; for example, recently, in the comics, Ultron has fused with his creator, [[Hank Pym]].\n*Ultron-Sigma inherits [[w:c:megaman:Sigma|Sigma]]'s ability to wield swords, which are actually [[lightsaber]]s, similar to those used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, as well as those used by [[Xemnas]] in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series. Fellow ''[[w:c:megaman:Mega Man X (series)|Mega Man X]]'' series character [[w:c:megaman:Zero|Zero]] also uses a lightsaber.\n*Ultron-Sigma can be considered to be a counterpart to [[w:c:mortalkombat:Dark Kahn|Dark Kahn]] from ''[[w:c:mortalkombat:Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe|Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', a fusion of [[w:c:dccomics:Darkseid|Darkseid]] and [[w:c:mortalkombat:Shao Kahn|Shao Kahn]], two supervillains from two alternate universes and two different companies, and who spreads a negative influence, the Sigma virus, similar to how Dark Kahn spreads the [[w:c:mortalkombat:Kombat Rage|Kombat Rage]] in ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe''. (Note: {{WikipediaLink|Midway Games}}, the original developer for the ''[[w:c:mortalkombat:Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' series of video games, was bought out by {{WikipediaLink|Warner Bros.}}, which also owns {{WikipediaLink|DC Comics}}, and was rebranded as {{WikipediaLink|NetherRealm Studios}}.)\n**There are three notable differences between Ultron-Sigma and Dark Kahn:\n***The first difference is that the former was created intentionally by Ultron and Sigma merging on purpose by using the Space and Reality Infinity Stones, whereas the latter was created by accident, as the result of [[w:c:mortalkombat:Raiden|Raiden]] defeating Shao Kahn in the ''Mortal Kombat'' universe, and [[w:c:dccomics:Superman|Superman]] defeating Darkseid in the DC Universe at the exact same time, and rather than either of them getting destroyed, the timing of both villains' defeats causes them to merge into Dark Kahn instead, although in both cases, the merging of the two supervillains into one body in turn causes both of their respective universes to merge.\n***The second difference is that Ultron-Sigma merges the Marvel and Capcom universes into one with the intention of eliminating all organic life, but wants to let the merged Earth remain intact afterward with only robots and other machines populating the planet, whereas Dark Kahn merges the ''Mortal Kombat'' and DC Universes by causing them to grind the two universes together, which would ultimately tear them both apart, destroying both universes and all forms of life within the two universes, as quoted by [[w:c:dccomics:Batman|Batman]] in the story mode of ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe''; in this aspect, this is similar to the 2003-2004 DC/Marvel crossover comic book event ''[[wikipedia:JLA/Avengers|JLA/Avengers]]'', wherein DC Universe villain [[w:c:dccomics:Krona|Krona]] attempts to destroy both the DC and Marvel Universes by grinding them together, which would have ultimately led to both universes getting torn apart, destroying both universes and all forms of life within the two universes.\n***The third difference is the aftermaths after Ultron-Sigma and Dark Kahn are defeated; in ''Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite'', Ultron-Sigma is destroyed, and relinquishes the Space and Reality Infinity Stones after they are destroyed, but because the Reality Stone is damaged, the two universes cannot be separated again; in ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'', after Raiden and Superman defeat Dark Kahn, the two universes are separated, and everyone has been sent back to their respective universes, with the exceptions of Darkseid and Shao Kahn, who have been switched to opposite universes; Darkseid is imprisoned in the [[w:c:mortalkombat:Netherrealm|Netherrealm]], while Shao Kahn is imprisoned in the [[w:c:dccomics:Phantom Zone|Phantom Zone]].\n*Its leitmotif incorporates elements from Sigma's battle theme from ''[[w:c:megaman:Mega Man X2|Mega Man X2]]/[[w:c:megaman:Mega Man X6|X6]]'' as well as \"Heroes/Avengers Unite\" from ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''<nowiki/>'s original soundtrack.\n*In the second-to-last battle of arcade mode, the standard form of Ultron-Sigma is fairly easy to beat. However, in the first battle of story mode, Ultron-Sigma has a few \"cheats,\" which make him very hard to play against, similar to the final bosses from the 2D sprite era of the ''[[w:c:streetfighter:Street Fighter series|Street Fighter]]'' series and also particularly from many {{WikipediaLink|SNK}} fighting games. Even if the player manages to survive long enough in the first battle without dying, the next scene will play out the same regardless, once the player clears two-thirds of Ultron-Sigma's vitality. His standard form does not have these cheats in arcade mode, but he does have these cheats for the first battle in story mode. The cheats that he possesses in this battle include:\n**Enhanced defenses and an increased health bar.\n**Similar to the Mind Stone's Infinity Storm, its Hyper Combo Gauge keeps on automatically filling up to maximum.\n*In the final battles of both story mode and arcade mode, his final form of Ultron Omega is significantly tougher than his standard form, for similar reasons as listed above:\n**He has significantly above-average vitality.\n**He can regenerate vitality while summoning Ultron Drones, of which there are no limits as to how many times he can summon Ultron Drones, and sometimes, he can summon two Ultron Drones at once, and the longer the player takes to defeat his Ultron Drones, the more vitality Ultron Omega regenerates.\n**His Infinity Stone gauge is supercharged; it charges much faster than normal, allowing him to use numerous Infinity Storms much more often than the player would normally be able to do throughout the match.\n**Some of his attacks can do significant damage to the player's health bar.\n*Despite Ultron-Sigma not having the capability to wield the Soul Stone, the defused robots can use the Soul Stone at ease outside of Story Mode. Additionally, a mod hack revealed that Ultron-Sigma can still use the Soul Stone with no repercussion in gameplay.\n*As demonstrated by Ultron within [[Hank Pym]]\u2019s body in the prelude of [[Marvel Comics]]' 2018 comic book event ''{{WikipediaLink|Infinity Countdown}}'', the only way for Ultron and Sigma to use the Soul Stone is that they need to possess organic hosts, such as humans, and trap their souls inside the said stone in order to use its full-power, without having side-effects. Not possessing the knowledge on possessing organic hosts first in order to be able to tap into the Soul Stone\u2019s power was a major mistake and the biggest weakness for Ultron-Sigma, which turned them into Ultron Omega and cured the Sigma Virus.\n*Fellow ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]'' characters [[w:c:megaman:Mega Man X (character)|Mega Man X]] and [[w:c:megaman:Zero|Zero]] are also robots, but unlike Ultron and Sigma, they are heroic characters with noble personalities. Gameplay-wise, they can use the Soul Stone with no repercussions, but it is unknown as to whether or not they can use the Soul Stone in the story, since technically, because they are robots, they have no souls either, in a case of gameplay and story segregation. Mega Man X did in fact channel the Soul Stone's power when using the Infinity Buster in order to destroy Ultron Omega, but whether or not he can also use it in the traditional manner however, is unknown.\n\n==Videos==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=munLeETWo8Q A video of a player successfully lasting long enough to clear two-thirds of Ultron-Sigma's vitality in the ''Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite'' demo]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36UfBvWeN3Y A video of the final chapter of the story mode of ''Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite'', showing how to defeat Ultron-Sigma's second and final form, Ultron Omega]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fusion characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]"
