The ''Pearl'' had many crews over the course of the film series, either captained by [[Jack Sparrow]] or [[Hector Barbossa]] (until Barbossa's death in ''Dead Men Tell No Tales'') since the Age of Piracy since there were two ''Pearl'' captains at this era.\n\nThroughout the adventures, the crew went on a dangerous adventure in seeking the [[Treasure of Cort\u00e9s]] and the [[Dead Man's Chest]] throughout the Age of Piracy during the events of ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' and ''Dead Man's Chest''. During the War Against Piracy, the crew seeked the [[Brethren Court]] to stop [[Cutler Beckett]] from eradicating piracy under forces of the [[East India Trading Company]] within the events of ''At World's End''. During the events of ''On Stranger Tides'', the crew was disbanded due to the infamous pirate [[Blackbeard]] taking control of the ship by capturing it, but the crew was later formed when the crew of the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and the crew of the ''Dying Gull'' joined forces to fight against [[Captain Salazar]] and his [[Crew of the Silent Mary|undead crew]] during the events of ''Dead Men Tell No Tales''.\n\n==Crew==\n===Captain===\n<tabber>\nJack Sparrow=\n{{Main|Jack Sparrow}}\nA legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, Captain Jack Sparrow is the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, he fights a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies. Jack Sparrow\u2019s first love is the sea, his second his beloved ship the ''Black Pearl'', and is happiest at the helm. For him, it is more than \"a keel, a hull, a deck, and sails...\" - it's freedom. Though his crew mutinied, he will always be Captain Jack Sparrow, and the ''Pearl'' will always be his.\n\n|-|Hector Barbossa=\n{{Main|Hector Barbossa}}\nOriginally, Hector Barbossa signed on as the first mate on the ''Black Pearl'', rising through the ranks, and swiftly became captain through treachery and cruelty. The mutiny he led robbed Captain Jack Sparrow of his ship and a crew. In the first film, Barbossa is seen leading his crew in search of gold and blood to lift the Aztec curse. Barbossa is old enough to be the father of some members of his cursed crew, but none question his authority. Even when they blame him for the curse, Barbossa's legendary skill with a sword makes sure he remains their chief. A vile pirate returned from the dead, Hector Barbossa is the ultimate survivor, occasionally entering an uneasy alliance with his rival, Jack Sparrow.\n</tabber>\n===Notable crew members===\n<tabber>\nCursed Crew=\n{{Main|Cursed Crew of the Black Pearl}}\n{{Group Infobox\n|image = Barbossa Crew.jpg\n|name = Cursed Crew\n|films= ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''\n|games = ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]<br>[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow]]<br>[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]''}}The first crew of the Black Pearl was originally captained by [[Jack Sparrow]]. A decade prior to ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'', Barbossa led a mutiny and marooned Sparrow. Soon after, Barbossa and the crew became cursed after stealing coins from an ancient Aztec chest. They became immortal, but the curse rendered them unable to feel, taste, or satisfy their desires. The lunar light exposed them as skeletal beings. Later, the curse was broken, and the ship once again fell under Jack's command. At the end of the third film, ''At World's End'', the ''Pearl'' briefly returns to Barbossa's hands before losing it and his leg prior to the events of ''On Stranger Tides''.\n\n[[File:Pirates1-disneyscreencaps.com-7149.jpg|thumb|250px|The Crew under Moonlight.]]Crew members who appear in ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' include '''[[Bo'sun]]''' (played by Isaac C. Singleton Jr., a large African man that acts as Barbossa's second in command), '''Clubba''' (played by David Patykewich, a large bald man with facial tattoos and a large earring), '''Grapple''' (played by [[Trevor Goddard]], a sailor who fights with a large grappling iron), '''[[Jacoby]]''' (played by Vince Lozano, a man with a long black beard and uses hand grenades), '''[[Koehler]]''' (played by Treva Etienne, a slender African man with dreadlocks), '''Mallot''' (played by Brye Cooper, who wields a large mallet), '''Scratch''' (played by Finneus Egan, sporting blond dreadlocks who wields a dagger), and '''[[Twigg]]''' (played by Michael Berry Jr., an Irish sailor who is often paired with Koehler). In the film, five of them (Clubba, Grapple, Jacoby, Mallot, and Scratch) are knocked apart by either explosion or impact and died instantly when the curse was lifted. Koehler is also killed in the final battle by [[James Norrington]], revealing to the pirates that they are mortal once again; it is unknown what happened to Bo'sun, Twigg, and the rest of the crew, although it is likely they were arrested by the British and executed.\n\nBo'sun, Twigg, and Jacoby appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' as cursed pirates. They are voiced by Beau Billingslea, Adam Leadbeater, and [[John DiMaggio]] respectively.\n\n|-|Joshamee Gibbs=\n{{Main|Joshamee Gibbs}}\nOnce a sailor in His Majesty\u2019s Royal Navy, then an enthusiastic pirate, Joshamee Gibbs is Jack Sparrow's first mate and most trusted friend. Gibbs is a man who knows his way across every ocean, and into every pub. He possesses an endless capacity to forgive, necessary when you sail with Captain Jack, but himself lives by the Pirate's Code and is willing to leave Jack behind if necessary. Teller of tales, handy with a bottle, this veteran sea salt is truly a skillful sailor who cleverly navigates his way through many deadly situations.\n\n|-|Pintel and Ragetti=\n{{Main|Pintel and Ragetti}}\nPintel and Ragetti muddle their way from one situation to another, small minds in the middle of great events. They are cutthroat pirates but more often than not their lack of common sense and their constant bickering make them the clowns of Barbossa's crew. The duo was pressed into service by the English Navy, but jumped ship after a year of beatings, bad food, and boredom and eventually found themselves on the ''Black Pearl''.\n\n|-|Marty=\n{{Main|Marty (Pirates of the Caribbean)}}\nMarty, played by [[Martin Klebba]], is a dwarf pirate hired by Jack Sparrow and Joshamee Gibbs to search for the ''Black Pearl'' in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''. Originally serving aboard the ''[[HMS Interceptor|Interceptor]]'', Marty has only one line of dialogue in the first film, but he becomes more prominent in the second and third films, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', as one of the main crew members of the ''Black Pearl''. In ''Dead Man's Chest'', Marty noticed Jack was acting \"a bit strange...er\" and participated in the search for the [[Dead Man's Chest]]. Marty was one of the few survivors the [[Kraken]]'s attack, which ended with the ''Black Pearl'' being dragged to the depths along with Jack Sparrow. In ''At World's End'', Marty agreed to travel to World's End to bring Jack back from Davy Jones' Locker. In ''At World's End'', Marty provided comic relief such as being blown off his feet after firing a blunderbuss in Singapore. He later fired his guns at Davy Jones' crew during the maelstrom battle. Throughout the film, Marty followed both Jack Sparrow and the resurrected Hector Barbossa, who both wanted to be captain of the ''Black Pearl'', but Marty ends up joining Barbossa in stealing the ''Pearl''.\n\nIn ''Dead Men Tell No Tales'', Marty is shown to have survived the [[Blackbeard]] attack in ''On Stranger Tides''. In the end, Marty joins Jack again on board the Black Pearl who has regained its normal size.\n</tabber>\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:pirates:Crew of the Black Pearl|Crew of the Black Pearl]] on [[w:c:pirates|Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki]]\n\n{{Wikipedia|List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crew of the Black Pearl, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]"
