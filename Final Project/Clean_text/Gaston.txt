into single character Gaston this version Gaston was depicted very differently Instead hunter who was the town hero was marquess French nobleman would have shared the role antagonist with Belle aunt Marguerite who would have chosen him Belle suitor specifically revenge towards Maurice who this version was failed merchant who lost his wealth sea just like the original tale also was shown only

side his face and crooked nose His attire consisted sky blue jacket and powdered wig tied with red ribbon All these features gave him somewhat similar appearance French noblemen such Jean Rousseau Napoleon After Jeffrey Katzenberg demanded rewrite the film Gaston characterization was altered significantly being made into the town hero well the village local hunter According Linda Woolverton she had based this version Gaston her own unsuccessful relationships and she had also wanted Belle decrying Gaston being her suitor whom Woolverton referred blockhead the focal point the film necessitating that Belle wicked sisters and their respective love interests left out well cutting her snobbish Marguerite Aunt Marguerite Story reels for the Beauty and the Beast Original Screenplay original screenplay included the Platinum and Diamond Editions the Beauty and the Beast 1991 film final film indicate that his surname was proposed LeGume referred such Marguerite This acted pun his small minded views The name was presumably dropped the first draft Linda Woolverton treatment the story both Belle and its reprise the Bimbettes and Belle referred him and herself Monsieur Gaston and albeit sarcastically Madame Gaston respectively implying that Gaston was his surname addition Linda Woolverton initial draft what would become the story the film had his role largely being similar although would have paid slightly more attention the triplets giving them handsome look their way during the opening song and also proceeded sarcastically give his review book Belle was reading and also supplied her with trophy gift addition Gaston when learning the failure his plans and Belle falling for Beast also nearly attempted hit Belle but stopped when realizing the villagers were watching although was implied that their fearful gasps what his nearly hitting Belle was what inspired him rabble rouse them into killing the Beast The initial draft also emphasized that Gaston was feared the village rather than truly loved during the aftermath the wedding scene where went over the wedding cake fury and the villagers were horrified One the cut lyrics for the Gaston song also had Who breaks hearts like Gaston implying that even before the Beast entered the picture Gaston was very treacherous individual his friends and allies also was intended directly over Monsieur Arque asylum recruit him instead having him arrive the Tavern illicitly the original fairy tale there character resembling Gaston the plot with the antagonists having been Belle jealous sisters who were adapted into the Bimbettes Gaston character can however found the influential 1946 Beauty and the Beast film Jean Cocteau which the Disney version takes some inspiration that film there character named Avenant who attempts have Belle marry him only have his affections scorned plots murder the Beast order marry Belle climbs the walls Beast castle and attempts murder him only killed himself While notes from production reference Avenant influence Gaston the similarities are apparent and known the Jean Cocteau film was point inspiration Story threads show that the Beauty and the Beast Original Screenplay original screenplay Gaston would have tried use his sword stab the Beast only lose his balance and fall off the garden wall his death the Beauty and the Beast Original Screenplay 1989 Plotline 1989 screenplay Gaston was not meant killed the end the film Instead the Beast was finish their battle knocking him over wall leaving him unconscious the earliest scripts Gaston death would have been different the battle against Beast would have taken place the forest this early version the script Gaston would wound the Beast and nearly kill him with his gun when Belle strikes him from behind with rock This would have prompted him fall off cliff Upon trying stand notices that the wolves who attacked Maurice and Belle earlier are looking him and kill him This idea was scrapped because the writers thought that was too gruesome and horrible Although this idea was used The Lion King more specifically the sequence Scar death the hands rather jaws the hyenas Ironically the above mentioned scene Scar death the final version the ending was chosen for the exact same reason why Gaston original death was cut the The Lion King Alternate Ending original ending was deemed too graphic and scary for Disney film addition the final version Gaston death also had some alterations moments prior his plunge from the castle his unseen death Gaston was supposed stab the Beast the back and the leg but the second injury was cut from the final script edit violence was also originally intended for Gaston commit suicide after stabbing the Beast the back and laugh madly fell from the tower believing that could not win Belle nobody else would which might explain why Gaston chose such dangerous position stab the Beast from behind despite knowing that would never win Belle heart However this was edited out due the dark nature the scene the initial draft Linda Woolverton story Beast would have immediately fought Gaston after the latter kicked the footstool with the Wardrobe also aiding Beast some degree addition Gaston after Beast decided merciful and spare him proceeded run Beast through the back with his sword with Beast turn punching him off the balcony his death Gaston strong and handsome and exploits these traits the fullest While not clear considers himself good person not like Governor Ratcliffe Governor Ratcliffe and Claude Frollo the villagers very much considering how popular with them especially the Bimbette triplets and how they seem unaware his true nature Gaston reprise the original film notwithstanding and this serves fuel his already massive ego narcissist who sees himself superior everyone around him Gaston proud boorish uncultured greedy short tempered bad mannered narcissistic and sexist also impulsive and arrogant evidenced his setting wedding before even proposed Belle under the expectation that she approve becoming his wife thinking she was love with him Convinced that powerful enough defeat the bigger and stronger Beast himself Gaston even taunts the Beast wanting him fight back wants prove that can kill him fair fight However his arrogance makes him underestimate his opponent and once realizes his life the line may have rely desperate measures survive Despite this was not arrogant enough believe there was risk being killed the Beast freely admits that fighting the Beast does have the likelihood that the other villagers might very likely die during The Mob Song Despite his belief that thinking dangerous pastime suggesting that anti intellectual Gaston can cunning calculating and manipulative which emphasized twice the story first when comes with plan blackmail Belle into marrying him threatening have her father Maurice thrown into insane asylum should she refuse Due poor management and cruel treatment inmates this surprisingly harsh threat When that plan foiled Belle showing the Beast with magic mirror Gaston simply improvises and quickly turns the tables manipulating the villagers into forming mob kill the Beast thus eliminating his competition Gaston not above using underhanded tactics which had earlier been implied with LeFou claim about Gaston being slick well Gaston admission about being good taking cheap shots and confirmed when shows himself literally backstabber his final moments showing that also cheats things fact his begging the Beast may have been nothing more than trick still had knife his person and the Beast was kind and gentle Belle described him then Gaston would have appealed his enemy better nature thus allowing him brought back solid ground before could get last shot Regardless his cunning and manipulation Gaston far from the smartest Disney Villain Gaston the kind person who won give his goals easily matter how much Belle evades him however hard the humiliation receives determined make her his wife His persistence such that will great lengths and sink low ensure wins Even when the Beast overwhelms him Gaston will not tolerate losing Belle this monster This drive will blind him the dangers climbing balcony which overlooks deep abyss causing him fall his death the film Gaston vocabulary skills are slightly inconsistent when Belle refers him being positively primeval early the film the latter apparently takes either compliment clearly not knowing what the term actually means joke However the Gaston song accurately uses the word expectorating reference his skills spitting expectorating being more fancy way saying the term spit Gaston view women extremely sexist and misogynistic even standards the time which the film takes place While appears charming all the other women the village such the Bimbettes who being products upbringing the village grew see nothing wrong with Gaston behavior completely mesmerized his muscles and handsome face Belle the only woman the entire town able see him for what really from the very start the film believes that women like Belle are not supposed smart think for themselves get ideas and even tosses Belle book into the mud attempt get her focus more important things namely himself Because this Gaston attempts charm Belle always fall flat because his chauvinistic boorish behavior His sexism and misogyny also shown the fact that does not seem even consider the possibility fathering any daughters states wants six seven strapping boys like himself Gaston suffers from Enhanced Strength While lacking agility Gaston shown possess tremendous amount physical strength evidenced his effortlessly lifting bench with three adult females the Bimbettes well holding with only hand effortlessly rips off stone ornament from the castle use makeshift club during his battle with the Beast The fact that can fight and knock back the Beast also quite impressive given his size Still though compared the creature his strength inferior Skilled Marksman also able fire his blunderbuss with pinpoint accuracy noted LeFou proclaiming Wow You didn miss shot Gaston This however was briefly contradicted the Marvel Comics where manages miss rabbit despite being fairly close addition has proved that skilled archer during the climax the castle Stealth also shown skilled stealth attacks implied the song Gaston with the lyrics slick Gaston and confirmed when manages stab the Beast the back while the latter was distracted with joy that Belle returned even though had climb several areas reach him Skilled Tactician noted above despite his otherwise revulsion the concepts reading getting ideas and overall intelligence and intellectualism specifically for women shown somewhat skilled plotter having come with the blackmail idea addition also had decent enough observation skills pick the hint that Belle may have had feelings for the Beast just from few subtle clues late into the film Skilled Manipulator also very good manipulation after discovering that Belle love with the Beast uses the villagers ignorance and prejudices well his own popularity rally them into killing the Beast Despite this however ultimately shows himself very reckless regarding his planning This especially evident Gaston reprise where loudly divulges crowded tavern enough key details about his blackmail plan have all but ensured that everyone knows his true nature though most them still went along with anyway Gaston professional hunter and the local hero small French village unknown point
