He is a high-ranking member of the CIA who crosses paths with the [[Punisher]] due to their time in Afghanistan. He is highly corrupt and thus has several connections with organized crime syndicates, which is why he is determined to take down Punisher. He is a brilliant criminal mastermind. He lost his left eye when the Punisher punched it out after he callously dismissed the near-deaths of soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rawlins, William}}\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:The Punisher characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
