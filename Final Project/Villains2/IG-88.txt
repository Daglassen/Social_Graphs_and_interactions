He is hired by [[Darth Vader]] to capture [[Han Solo]] and also is the chief rival of [[Boba Fett]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''The Empire Strikes Back''\u00a0===\nIG-88 is summoned aboard the\u00a0''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought ''Executor''\u00a0by [[Darth Vader]] in his search for the\u00a0''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.\n\n=== ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]'' ===\nIG-88 teamed up with\u00a0[[Hondo Ohnaka]]\u00a0to collect the\u00a0bounty\u00a0on\u00a0Crimson Dawn\u00a0lieutenant\u00a0[[Qi'ra]]'s\u00a0head. Tracking Qi'ra down, IG-88 and Hondo managed to apprehend Qi'ra. Turning the bounty hunter and the\u00a0pirate\u00a0against each other, Qi'ra convinced IG-88 to collect the bounty on Hondo instead of the bounty on her. Attacking Hondo, IG-88 was quickly\u00a0stunned\u00a0and put in\u00a0binders. After Qi'ra had similarly tricked and apprehended Hondo, IG-88 was led away by Qi'ra so that she could collect the bounty on his head.\n\nLater, IG-88\u00a0pursued\u00a0Princess\u00a0[[Leia Organa]]\u00a0on\u00a0[[Garel]], seeking a\u00a0data-tape\u00a0in her possession of\u00a0Imperial\u00a0base locations. Organa was assisted by\u00a0[[Sabine Wren]], who identified the droid, and the pair fled as the assassin opened fire in the corridors of\u00a0Garel City Spaceport. However, Wren planted a\u00a0paint bomb, surprising IG-88, and covering him in purple paint. Leia convinced several\u00a0[[stormtroopers]]\u00a0to fire at the bounty hunter, and the droid was hit by a blast before retreating.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Ralph McQuarrie]]'s production sketches show a sleeker design than the droid that appears in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and were later used as the model for the IG-RM Thug droids in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.\n* The term \"IG-88\" is not the original name for the character, as the ''Empire Strikes Back'' script calls the character a \"chrome war droid\", and during production, it was called \"Phlutdroid\".\n* The production puppet consisted of recycled props from ''A New Hope'', including the Mos Eisley cantina drink dispenser as IG-88's head.\n* Another assassin droid named IG-11 appeared in ''[[The Mandalorian]]''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDisney-Store-Trading-Pin-Star-Wars-IG-88.jpg\nIG-88_Pin.jpg\nIG-88 POP.jpg\nIG-88 Hot Wheels.jpg|IG-88 Hot Wheels car\nIG-88_Black_Series.jpg\nIG_88_Sideshow.png\nLEGO-IG-88.png|[[LEGO]] IG-88 figure\nIG-88_Forces of Destiny.JPG|IG-88 in ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]''\n</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n* [[w:c:starwars:IG-88|IG-88]] on [[w:c:starwars|Wookieepedia]]\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[fi:IG-88]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Droids]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars: Forces of Destiny characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
