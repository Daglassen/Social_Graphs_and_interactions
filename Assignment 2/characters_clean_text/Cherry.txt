The Ancient Oven, also known as Cherry, is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
The Ancient Oven is a reworked Guidance Stone who can be found in the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab. Cherry's namesake is that of Robbie's first love; it is now referred to as Ancient Oven, for calling it Cherry upsets its co-creator, and Robbie's wife, Jerrin. When provided with Guardian remains and Rupees, the Ancient Oven dispenses to Link Ancient Soldier Gear and the Ancient Set. The Ancient Oven appears not to recognize Link, referring to him as "FamiliarNameMissing" instead.
