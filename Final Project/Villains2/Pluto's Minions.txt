Pluto takes her to the Underworld, where dozens of imps celebrate. One imp gives Pluto a crown to Persephone to make her his queen; one plays on a hellish organ whilst others dance in circles around a crater spewing fire behind them. They are not seen after that.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nThe goddess of spring 5large.jpg\nDevil Plays His Organ.jpg\nPluto in his Underworld.jpg\nPluto Rising.jpg\nPluto and his Minion.jpg\nDSA_Imp.png|Model for [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
