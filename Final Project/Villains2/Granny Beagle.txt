She is usually the one to come up with schemes, either it be for a great heist or to break out of jail.\n\n==Appearances==\nGranny Beagle first appeared in the gag comic from ''The Beagle Boys\u00a0''issue of February [[1967]], illustrated by [[Tony Strobl]] and Steven Steere.\n\nIn this comic, the Beagle Boys are in prison and expecting a visit from their granny. The prison guard remarks that they \"maybe they'll feel more cooperative after a reunion with her\". This assumption soon turns out to be wrong, as Grandma Beagle decides to break the walls of the prison with a pickaxe in order to see her grandchildren. The other prison guard exclaims, \"she won't even ''visit'' according to regulations!\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Grandma Beagle's appearance varies depending on the source. In some comics, she has white or grey hair, and in others her hair is either blonde or red.\n*According to some instances of the [[INDUCKS]] database, Granny Beagle is actually Auntie Beagle, and vise-versa. Because of their nearly identical designs, differentiating can be diffult; however, they have two distinctly different relations from the Beagle Boys: grandmother and aunt.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGrannyBeagleBoys.jpg|Granny Beagle on the cover of ''The Beagle Boys''.\nGrannyBeagles.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beagle, Granny}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]"
