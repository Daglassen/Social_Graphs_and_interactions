With the tarsier costume off, the jackal seems to be evil, mean-spirited, cruel, and carnivorous.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHe has the typical appearance of a tarsier: He is short with grayish-brown fur with a cream light-brown chest and bushy end of his tail. He also has purple eyes, a red nose, peach ears and mouth, and buck teeth.\n\nThe tarsier later reveals himself to be a large gray jackal with yellow eyes and a blue nose.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===\n[[File:WildDog.png|thumb|left|200px|The tarsier's true form.]]\nThe tarsier first appears when Timon and Pumbaa come across a skeleton, claiming that there is a predator on the loose. He tells them that he believes Simba is the predator.\n\nHe later appears after Timon believes that Simba is definitely the predator and tells him and Pumbaa to come with him to a safe place. This \"safe place\" is a cave filled with other skeletons where the tarsier reveals himself to be in fact a jackal and that he has been trying to get Timon and Pumbaa away from Simba for months. He prepares to eat them, but just then, Simba arrives to save them. The jackal quickly puts back on his tarsier disguise and is picked up and spit out by Simba, who throws him far away.\n==Trivia==\n* The tarsier\u2019s initial appearance and mannerisms closely resemble that of the famous Hollywood actor Peter Lorre.\n*Tarsiers are not native to the continent of Africa, but rather the Philippines and other islands of Southeast Asia. However, this is ultimately a disguise for his true form.\n* The jackal in question is most likely based on the African Golden Wolf, formerly classified as an African subspecies of the Eurasian Golden Jackal.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTLK Tarsier.png|The tarsier coming out of the grass\nTLK Tarsier2.png|The tarsier warning Timon and Pumbaa about Simba\nTLK Tarsier3.png|The tarsier hiding back in the grass\nTLK Tarsier4.png|The tarsier coming out of a rock\nTLK Tarsier5.png|The tarsier letting Timon and Pumbaa know about a \"safe place\"\nTLK Tarsier6.png|The tarsier in the cave with Timon and Pumbaa\nTLK Tarsier7.png|The tarsier laughing nervously\nTLK Tarsier8.png|The tarsier revealed himself to be a wild dog\nTLK Tarsier9.png|Timon and Pumbaa almost getting eaten by the wild dog\nTLK Tarsier10.png|The tarsier/wild dog's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarsier, The}}\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n\n[[Category:Jackals]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]"
