He appears on earth in flames and abducts the beautiful goddess. He takes her down to his lower world and crowns her as his queen.\n\nMeanwhile, on Earth, the world has turned cold and is experiencing an eternal winter without it's beautiful spring goddess. Down in the underworld, Persephone is depressed and longs for her world above. While Pluto may be sinister, he's not totally evil and her sorrow appeals to his better side.\n\nHe allows her to return as long as she spends six months out of the year with him. This short \"explains\" why we have the different seasons instead of an eternal spring.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nPluto and [[Hades]] are the same character on the show. It was evidenced when Hades demonstrate a unsuspected soft side: his love for Zelena (replacing Persephone), kidnapping her baby in the hope that she comes to him. Ironically, she was aspired into the same portal although he thinking that the witch was again in Oz. This love explain also why Hades had recreate the [[Underworld]] like similar to Storybrooke.\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Pluto\" is the Roman name for [[Hades]], which is Greek. The [[Disney+]] description of the short uses the Greek name, presumably to avoid confusion with the dog.\n*He has the same name as [[Mickey Mouse]]'s [[Pluto|pet dog]].\n*In terms of appearance and mannerisms, this version of Pluto is even more obviously devil-like than the already demonized Hades from ''[[Hercules]]'', but in terms of his actions, which are less malevolent, he is a more accurate potrayal of the mythological character than Hades.\n*In mythology, the story that inspired ''The Goddess of Spring'' was a part of the Greek's paganistic religion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nPluto hurter.jpg|Albert Hurter's designs for Pluto\nPluto_Rising.jpg\nKing_Pluto.png\nPluto_with_the_Goddess.jpg\nPluto_and_the_Goddess.jpg\nPluto_and_his_Minion.jpg\nPluto_in_his_Underworld.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Roman Mythology]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
