Ramella is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ramella is a Gerudo who came to the Eldin region in search of precious Jewels. She can be found wandering around Goron City during the day. She tells Link that he can buy Fireproof Elixirs from Offrak in the City, which she herself uses to continue her work. At night, she can be found asleep in the Rollin' Inn, dreaming of Jewels.
After Link has freed the Divine Beast Vah Rudania from Calamity Ganon's influence, Ramella will announce that since Death Mountain's eruptions have now ended, she has begun restocking on Jewels. She asks Link if he could bring her ten pieces of Amber, which she will buy at a higher price than at stores, initiating the Side Quest "The Jewel Trade". Ramella will offer to pay 500 Rupees for all ten Amber, 200 more compared to stores.
After Link has sold her the Amber, Ramella will then offer to buy more Jewels from Link at a higher price. She will ask for ten pieces of a randomly chosen Jewel each time. The Jewels she buys are Topaz, Ruby, Sapphire and Diamond; should Link have less than 10 of her requested Jewel, but try to sell anyway, Ramella accuses him of trying to pull a fast one. This will deadlock her into wanting no other Jewel until 10 of the requested Jewel is provided, after which she will choose another random Jewel. Successfully selling 10 Jewels of a certain type will have her offer to buy 10 more for the same price. This can happen indefinitely provided Link still has enough of that type of Jewel.
If Link speaks to Ramella while disguised (primarily the Gerudo Set, but the Snow and Sand Boots, and the Thunder Helm can be used in conjunction), a trade will not initiate. Ramella will instead claim she won't allow other Vai to get Jewels before her, considering disguised Link a business rival
