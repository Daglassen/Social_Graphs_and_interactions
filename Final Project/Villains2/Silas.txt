He is the mysterious leader of Nemesystems, whose ultimate goal is to steal from the Tomorrowland Transit Authority and conquer the universe.\n\n=== Background ===\nAs a TTA cadet he was supposed to be part of [[Mission Force One]], but was rejected because of his dislike of working with others. Silas also doubled as the mysterious leader of Nemesystems. As Commander Nemex, he tries to steal everything built by the Tomorrowland Transit Authority and control the universe. He was first mentioned by [[Admirals Watson and Crick]] in \"[[Connect and Protect]]\" and makes his first appearance in \"[[The Great Space Train Robbery]]\". When doing his evil plans, he wants to make sure that anyone or anything does not stand in his way. When he finally reveals himself as Commander Nemex in \"[[The Nemesystems Takeover]]\", Mission Force One's members are horrified especially Loretta, who saw Silas as a friend, only for Silas to tell her that he never had any friends. It was revealed that Silas had been secretly planning to takeover the Tomorrowland Transit Authority as Commander Nemex ever since he was rejected from Mission Force One. After his defeat, he chooses to stay on his ship and Aggro decides to stay with his boss as the two are launched into space.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSilas has shiny and gelled red hair, neon green skin with a light blue mark on the right side of his face, a charming smile, and his main clothing is a martial arts uniform.\n\nAs Commander Nemex, his hair is blue and he wears a blue, silver, and bronze suit with the Nemesystems logo on the chest plate.\n\n===Personality===\nSilas can be overconfident, selfish, stubborn, and he would rather work by himself than with others. But despite all that, he is very smart, and like Loretta, he is very good with computer codes. He is also very agile, charming, sweet-talking, and even flexible.\n\nHowever as Commander Nemex, he never cares for the well-being of others. Whenever his plans fail, he takes his anger out on his minion [[Aggro]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nFace-Off MF1.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Commanders]]\n\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]"
