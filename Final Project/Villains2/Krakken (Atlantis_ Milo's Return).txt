A few days later, upon [[Kida Nedakh|Kida]]'s first trip to the surface and [[Milo Thatch|Milo]]'s return to the surface along with [[Vincenzo Santorini|Vinnie]], [[Gaetan Moli\u00e9re|Mole]], and [[Audrey Ramirez|Audrey]], the Krakken attacks their ship but\u00a0is eventually foiled by Milo and his friends in their sub pods, destroying the beast with numerous missiles fired from their pods. According to Inger Alyyson, the innkeeper of a nearby fishing village, their magistrate [[Edgar Vulgud]] made a deal with the beast many years ago once their food supply (fish) began to shorten. The Krakken would steal the supplies of ships to provide for the town, and in turn the Krakken would steal the sounds of the people. As a side to the deal, Volgud asked for immortality but forgot to ask for eternal youth as well, making him age into a creepy old man. It is unknown why the fish left the village, although it is heavily hinted that the Krakken either scared off the fish or ate them so the deal could form. The sun in their village hasn't shone since the beast went loose in the sea.\n\nUpon being fatally damaged by missiles on a subpod, the Krakken faded away. Vinny commented that \"Mr. Squid was a little hocus pocus himself.\" The Krakken's defeat also killed his minion, Vulgud.\n\n==Powers==\n'''Hypnosis:''' The Kraken could put anyone in a trance for its, or Vulgud's service. They best way to undo this is to \"distract\" the victim (in Vinny's case, he was hit on the head by a wrench.)\n\n'''Prolonging Life:''' The Kraken kept Vulgud alive way past his normal lifespan.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nPossessed AudreyKrakken.jpg\nAtlantis Milo's Return 2.jpg|The Krakken's death\nKraken34.jpg|Milo sees a photo of the Kraken in his newspaper.\nAtlantis2-disneyscreencaps.com-2722.jpg|Audrey possessed by the beast.\npossessed Volgud.jpg|Possessed Vulgud\n</gallery>\n\n{{Atlantis: The Lost Empire}}\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Atlantis: The Lost Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Cephalopods]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Norse Mythology]]\n[[Category:Giants]]"
