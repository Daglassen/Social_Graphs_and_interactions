[[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] confronted this beast. He did not face it head as he exposed its weakness with his agile skills in its web and defeated the creature, leaving victorious with a mysterious Serpent Idol, and two halves of a [[Golden Scarab Beetle]], before meeting a Mystic with secret and sinister agendas of its own, and Aladdin heading across the desert, finding the entrance of The [[Cave of Wonders]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Disney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge]]''===\n{{CharacterStub}}''Coming soon!''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Arachnid Spider.jpg|The Arachnid.\nAladdin vs  The Arachnid.JPG|Aladdin battles the Arachnid in the oasis.\nArachnid gives scare.jpg|The Arachnid in the Oasis battle with Aladdin.\nArachnid's hindquarter Scarab.jpg|The Arachnid frightens Aladdin when he lands in her web in the oasis.\nArachnid mugshot.jpg|The Arachnid's mugshot.\nBattle With The Arachnid.jpg|The Arachnid's loading screen.\nArachnid Defeat.jpg|The Arachnid's defeat.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]"
