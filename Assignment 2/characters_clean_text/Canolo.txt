Canolo is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Canolo is a Hylian traveler who can be found in Gerudo Canyon. She was previously traveling with her friends Sesami, Oliff, Canolo, and Palme. However, the five of them were attacked by Bokoblins on the path to Koukot Plateau and ended up separated.
At Gerudo Canyon Stable, Link can find Sesami, who managed to escape. He asks Link to let Canolo and the rest of his friends know that he's waiting for them at the Stable. This initiates the Side Quest "Missing in Action".
Canolo can be found on the Gerudo Canyon's scaffolding across from Koukot Plateau, where she's being attacking by a Blue Bokoblin. After saving her, Canolo expresses her anger towards Sesami for abandoning them. She agrees to go to the Gerudo Canyon Stable, though she's still upset.
When she makes it to the Stable, Canolo calls Sesami a Cucco and thanks Link for saving her. She admits that she didn't know traveling could be so dangerous, as it wasn't mentioned in the guidebook she read. Having decided traveling isn't her thing, Canolo plans on heading back home after she rests. However, she has a feeling Link doesn't have the option to go home, so she wishes him well.
Canolo and the rest of her friends chip in to give Link a Gold Rupee as thanks for saving them. After the Quest is complete, Canolo and her friends, with the exception of Sesami, disappear from the Stable.
