He is a singing sensation, and [[Kim Crawford]]'s former crush. Ricky is also known for hand picking winners of contests to meet him, dating that girl,\u00a0then dumping her after he kisses them.\n\n\n\n==Background==\nRicky Weaver (parody of Justin Bieber) is a popular musician. He occasionally gets attacked by paparazzi. He has his own private jet.\n\n==History==\nIn each state, whoever writes the best essay gets a free school concert from Ricky Weaver. This contest is a hoax, because Ricky just picks out the prettiest girl so he can make a move on her. That's why he let Kim win the contest, just so he could make his move on her, and then dump her.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weaver, Ricky}}\n[[Category:Kickin' It characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Singers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]"
