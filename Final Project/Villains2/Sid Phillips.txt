He was [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s evil next door neighbor. Unlike his neighbor, he did extremely horrid things to his toys instead of treating them with love and care, until he learned to his horror that the toys were really alive, which gave him such a fright that he vowed to change his ways.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSid is a young, bratty, and somewhat disturbed 11-year-old skate punk with metal braces, whose idea of fun is terrorizing his little sister, [[Hannah Phillips|Hannah]], by taking her toys away and using them for scary experiments, like switching their heads or performing operations on them. He also destroys toys in many ways (exploding, burning, or in his \"mad doctor\" plays). Though despite this, he may have a lighter side, hinted in his dreams about ponies.\n\nAfter his toys turned on him, he vowed never to hurt a toy again. Aside from this, Sid remained mostly the same (especially his love of heavy metal) and eventually became a garbage man.\n\nSid is not a true villain, being that he did not realize that the toys are really alive when breaking them, but since this film is in the point of view of toys, he is considered an antagonist.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Toy Story]]''===\nIn ''Toy Story'', Sid is [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s sociopathic 11-year-old next door neighbor (until Andy moved near the end of the film). Sid was introduced in the beginning of the film as a toy terrorizer when he exploded a [[Combat Carl]] with an M-80, with his toy-chewing dog, [[Scud]], by his side, which prompts [[Bo Peep]] to say to the toys, \"The sooner we move, the better!\". Andy's toys were surprised to see him back at his old habits so soon, assuming he was kicked out of summer camp early this year. Later that day, when Andy and his family went to [[Pizza Planet]] for dinner, Sid was also there. After playing Whack-an-Alien, the Crane Game caught his attention. After grabbing a [[Little Green Men|Alien]], [[Buzz Lightyear]] was put in view after Buzz catches the sight of the crane game believing it to be a spaceship as he still does no't know that he is a toy. He then went after him, getting not only Buzz, but [[Woody]] hooked onto his foot as well.\n\nAfter skateboarding back home, with his new toys in his backpack, he was immediately greeted by Scud, to whom he gave the alien. Then, upon seeing his sister [[Hannah Phillips|Hannah]] with her Janie Doll, he snatched the toy and ran up to his room, slamming the door in Hannah's face. He then pulled out his Pterodactyl toy as he played doctor for his \"double bypass brain transplant.\" After putting Pterodactyl's head on Janie Doll's body, he opened up the door and showed Hannah. Scared, she ran off to report to their mother. Sid angrily threw the mutant toy onto the ground and furiously ran after her, claiming that Hannah was lying. With Sid gone, Woody explored his room to search for a way out but found the door locked and unable to escape. Trying to find another way out, he then discovered that Sid had taken toys apart and assembled them back together in weird combinations, much to Woody's horror. Woody believes that he and Buzz are gonna die either by being destroyed by Sid or dismantled by his toys.\n\nThe next morning, Sid tortured Buzz by spinning him on a drill bit (seen in a deleted scene), and then took Woody and threw him across the floor, pretending to interrogate him. Next, he opened up the window shade to let the sun in. He then took out a magnifying glass and focused the hot beam of light on Woody's forehead, until Sid's mom informed him his Pop-Tarts are ready.\n\nAfter Woody discovers that the Mutant Toys are friendly when they reattached Buzz's severed arm back in place, Sid returned to his room later, with a rocket he had ordered in the mail, labeled \"The Big One.\" He intended to blow apart one of his toys with the rocket for his own amusement. Initially, he was to blow up that \"wimpy cowboy doll,\" but he could not find him (as Woody hid under a milk crate). However, when he stepped on Buzz Lightyear's laser button, which activated the laser light-bulb, he chose to tape the rocket on Buzz, stating that he had always wanted \"to blow a spaceman into orbit\". Unfortunately for Sid, he was forced to delay the launch because of \"adverse weather conditions at the launch site\" when a rainstorm hit, giving Woody and Buzz time to reconcile overnight as Woody tells Buzz the joy of being a toy, which allows Buzz to gain the spirit of being a toy.\n\nWhile trying to escape, Sid woke up and took Buzz outside to blow him up. Woody and all of the [[Mutant Toys|mutant toys]] planned a way to exact revenge on Sid and help Buzz before Sid destroyed him with the rocket. The toys all appeared out of nowhere and approached Sid, making him increasingly scared. Woody then told Sid to take care of his toys because they would know if he did not. After seeing Woody come to life in front of his face warning him to play nice, it was too much for Sid and he screamed and cowardly retreated back into the house, frightened that the toys had come alive. Hannah then took pleasure in scaring her brother even more with her dolls after she discovered how scared he was as Sid runs upstairs, believing that one of Hannah's dolls would come to life.\n\nSid's rocket was ultimately utilized by Woody during the move to Andy's new house to help [[RC]], whose batteries had been depleted, back into the moving truck as Woody and Buzz both went skyrocketing, during which Buzz freed himself from the rocket by opening his wings to tear off the tapes that bounded him to the rocket (as for the rocket, it climbed up for a few feet higher before exploding into smithereens).\n\n===''[[Toy Story 2]]''===\nAlthough Sid did not appear in ''Toy Story 2'', he is mentioned by Buzz during his rescue mission with [[Slinky Dog]], [[Hamm]], [[Rex]] and [[Mr. Potato Head]] to save Woody who has been stolen by [[Al McWhiggin|a greedy toy collector]].\n\n===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===\n[[File:34294412969239siddy.jpg|thumb|250px|Sid as a garbage man.]]\nAfter 10 years since Woody has been rescued from Al and [[Stinky Pete]], Sid (now grown up) made a cameo appearance in ''Toy Story 3'' working on a garbage truck as he comes to pick up the trash from Andy's house (including Andy's toys who were also in a bag and mistakenly got put outside by [[Mrs. Davis]], whom Woody hurries out to rescue without being seen). Sid is mostly heard scatting to music and is identified by having the same skull T-shirt that he wore as a kid, along with a yellow vest, goggles, a goatee, and a big set of headphones. He is seen again near the end of the film after the toys escape from the incinerator at the [[Tri-County Landfill]] and hitch a ride on his garbage truck to get home. During his brief re-encounter with him earlier, Woody apparently did not recognize him as being Sid as he was more concerned about saving the others.\n\n==Printed media==\n===''[[Monsters, Inc.: Laugh Factory]]''===\n[[File:SidInMonstersIncComic.jpg|thumb|250px|Sid as he appears in the ''Monsters Inc.'' comic book.|left]]\nSid made guest appearances in issues 3 and 4 of the ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' comic book mini-series, ''Laugh Factory'', as the main antagonist, though his name is never actually given (as the monsters do not bother learning it from him). At the beginning of the third issue, \"Toy Worry\", he ducks into [[Boo]]'s bedroom to hide from [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] and [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] when they're pursuing him. We learn from Sulley and Mike that Sid has been using the monsters' door-traveling technology to break into kids' rooms and steal their toys. After Sid escapes with Boo's [[Jessie]] doll, Boo follows him into Monsters, Inc. to help Mike and Sulley capture him. Upon being caught and brought to the [[CDA]], Sid states that he has been stealing the toys in an attempt to \"save\" the kids from suffering the same traumatic incident he did, but the monsters do not believe him. They have Sid thrown back to his home through Hannah's door.\n\nIn the next issue's story, Sid breaks back into Monstropolis and helps [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] and [[Henry J. Waternoose]] escape from prison. They offer to give him the plans for their door-traveling technology (which Sid plans to get rich off of in his world) in exchange for him helping them get revenge on Sulley and Mike. They manage to capture the heroes along with [[Celia Mae|Celia]] and Boo (the latter of whom stowed away with Sulley as he was coming back from his last visit with her), but the girls manage to escape back into the human world with Sid and the two villainous monsters pursuing them. Eventually, Celia and Boo manage to find another closet door back to Monstropolis, where they lead Sid, Randall, and Waternoose into captivity by the CDA. At the end, Sid is again sent back home, with the monsters hoping that he has had enough of them now.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\nA live version of Sid first appeared in ''[[Toy Story: The Musical]]'' aboard the [[Disney Cruise Line]] ship ''[[Disney Wonder]]'', having his own villain song called \"Make a Little Noise\".\n\nSid would appear in the parks proper in 2021 as part of the Oogie Boogie Bash Halloween event at [[Disney California Adventure]], hosting a \"Sid Show Circus\" at [[Pixar Pier]]'s stage showcasing the Mutant Toys.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sid is currently the only known human in the ''Toy Story'' franchise who knows toys are alive (although [[Molly Davis]] is a debatable example).\n*Written on Sid's backpack is \"Julie Mcbarfle has cooties\". Art director Ralph Eggleston claims that this refers to Julie MacDonald, an editorial and camera manager who kept asking him to put her name somewhere in ''Toy Story''.\n**Also if one looks closely on the side of Sid's backpack during the part where Sid is giving Hannah's doll Janie an \"operation\", he/she can see a drawing of a three-eyed mutant ant on it. This drawing could be a possible reference to Pixar's next film, ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', where the film features an [[Flik|ant protagonist]].\n*During production, Sid was nicknamed \"Little Jack Nicholson.\" In addition, Sid's house has the same rug pattern as the Overlook Hotel from ''[[Wikipedia:The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', in which Nicholson starred.\n*In the book, ''Toy Story: The Art and Making of the Animated Film'', it is said that the story team tried beefing up Sid into a full-tilt bullying nemesis for his neighbour Andy. They generated scenarios of jealously and rivalry between Sid and Andy, but that approach threw the plot line out of balance. In the film itself, Sid and Andy are not even aware of each other's existence.\n*In ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Claws Ward runs out the door of a kids room on the scare floor. He states that the kid almost touched him. As he runs out, the \"Kill'n Paul Bunyan and his Blue Ox of Doom\" poster from Sid's room can be seen on the wall of the room. The same film also implied that the child at the time was six years old.\n*In a 2016 interview with some of the key animators of ''Toy Story'', they stated that their primary influence for the character Sid was actually one of the animator's longtime childhood friends, Ryan Newbert.\n**It is said that Sid was also inspired by a former Pixar employee who has been known to disassemble toys and use the parts to build strange creations.\n*Sid also appeared in a ''[[Toy Story Treats]]'' short ''Woody's Nightmare''. Sid was laughing evilly as he had swapped the heads of Woody and [[Buzz Lightyear]] (much like how he had replaced the Janie Doll's head with the Pterodactyl's).\n*Erik Von Detten reprised his role as Sid in ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. The fact that he is now older than he was when he did the first ''Toy Story'' movie had no effect on the character of Sid since he had also grown up. However, his dialogue was just scatting.\n**Sid was also von Detten's last acting role before his retirement in [[2010]].\n*[[Lee Unkrich]], the director of ''Toy Story 3'', confirmed that the garbage man in ''Toy Story 3'' is, in fact, Sid.\n*Sid and [[Al McWhiggin]] are the only main antagonists of the ''Toy Story'' film series to be human beings, as [[Stinky Pete]], [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear]] and [[Gabby Gabby]], the main antagonists of ''Toy Story''<nowiki/>'s three sequels, ''Toy Story 2'', ''Toy Story 3'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' were toys.\n*Debian's ''unstable'' trunk is named after him. Debian is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993.\n*[[Andrew Stanton]] considers Andy to actually be weirder than Sid since Andy takes absolute care of his toys.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Disney Pixar Toy Story|url=https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/toy-story#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20Sid%20is%20normal,popular%20tasks%20in%20Toy%20Story|website=pixar.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|Pixar|Sid Phillips|Pixar Wiki}}\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/b/bc/Favicon(2).ico|Villains|Sid Phillips|Villains Wiki}}\n{{PixarWiki}}\n{{Toy Story}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phillips, Sid}}\n[[es:Sid Phillips]]\n[[fr:Sid Phillips]]\n[[it:Sid Phillips]]\n[[pt-br:Sid Phillips]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Monsters, Inc. characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
