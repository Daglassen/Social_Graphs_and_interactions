You'll see. All magic comes with a price... and now, it's yours to pay.|Zoso's last words to Rumplestiltskin.}}\n\n'''Zoso''', formerly known as the '''Dark One''', is a minor antagonist of [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' and he appears in the eighth episode of the first season. Zoso is a evil man cursed with eternal life, but gifted with powerful magical abilities.\n\n==Background==\nLong ago, in the Enchanted Forest, a man named Zoso  stabbed [[Gorgon The Invincible|Gorgon]], harnesses the power of the Dark One and gains a [[Dark One's Dagger|cursed dagger]], which can bend his will to anyone who possesses it. In\u00a0''Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale'', it is mentioned that Zoso had been the Dark One for decades before he tricked [[Rumplestiltskin]] into taking the curse onto himself.\n\n==Role in the series==\n{{Quote|Then, perhaps, instead of controlling the power, you need to ''take'' it.|The \"beggar\" suggests Rumplestiltskin to kill the Dark One.}}\n\n===Before the First Curse===\nLearning of a [[Sorcerer Hat|sorcerer's box]] capable of absorbing and accumulating [[Magic|magic]], he takes down the [[The Apprentice (character)|apprentice]] guarding it. However, when Zoso waves the dagger over the box, a powerful wave of magic from within the item blasts him away. As the Dark One lies still on the ground, the apprentice informs him that the [[The Sorcerer (Once Upon a Time)|sorcerer]] cursed the box so that anyone who has succumbed to darkness cannot break it open. Beaten, Zoso teleports out of sight.\n\nLater, he is enslaved by the Duke of the Frontlands, who acquires the dagger and gives it to one of his soldiers, Hordor. During an [[Ogre]] War, the Duke enlists all children aged fourteen to be trained as soldiers for his army. He dispatches Hordor to a village to pick up a girl named Morraine, who recently turned fourteen, as her parents beg for mercy. From a considerable distance, Zoso is ordered by Hordor via the [[Dark One's Dagger|dagger]] to magically force Morraine's parents into submission, which frightens the other villagers immensely. Unable to be freed of the curse of the Dark One, Zoso decides to goad someone else into killing him with the dagger so he can be free. He manipulates a cowardly wool spinner, [[Rumplestiltskin]], whose only desire is to protect his son [[Neal Cassidy|Baelfire]] from being forced to fight in the Ogre War. Disguised as a beggar, Zoso gains his sympathy and is offered food and shelter for the night. Zoso purposely tells Rumplestiltskin about the wonders of the dagger and encourages him to steal it from the Duke so he may gain control of the Dark One. Rumplestiltskin burns down the Duke's castle and snatches the dagger for himself. In the woods, he summons Zoso, who appears as a hooded figure. Rumplestiltskin cowers in fear of him, but quickly reacts in a blinded rage when Zoso taunts that his son was fathered by someone else. Zoso is stabbed to death by him, and reverts to human form. Rumplestiltskin is stunned at his true identity while Zoso briefly laments about life being a great burden for himself. Lastly, he affirms that Rumplestiltskin is the perfect pawn to help ensure his own death because he, like himself, is a desperate man. Upon death, Zoso's name disappears from the dagger while Rumplestiltskin's name replaces his.\n\n===After the Third Curse===\nZoso is present with all past Dark Ones lead by [[Nimue (character)|Nimue]], appearing in [[Emma Swan|Emma]]'s head to watch her reunite [[Sword in the Stone (object)|Excalibur]] with the [[Dark One's Dagger]].\n\nAfter Hook creates a portal to the [[Underworld]], Zoso, along with the other Dark Ones all return in their physical form to [[Storybrooke]] to snuff out the light.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Zoso has the second longest gap between his first and second appearances with sixty-one episodes between \"[[Desperate Souls]]\" and \"[[The Apprentice]]\".\n*The Dark One's name, Zoso, refers to a nickname for Led Zeppelin guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, who was represented on Led Zeppelin's fourth (unnamed) album by a symbol resembling the letters ZoSo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nZosotheDarkOne.png|The Dark One insults the Apprentice\nOnce Upon a Time - 1x08 - Desperate Souls - Dark One Powers.png\nOnce Upon a Time - 1x08 - Desperate Souls - Dark One Powers.png\n108DarkOneStops.png\n108ThankYouThankYou.png\n108Benefactor.png\n108Zoso.png\nOnce Upon a Time - 1x08 - Desperate Souls - Zoso.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 1x08 - Desperate Souls - Dark One's Death.png|Zoso's corpse\nFile:Past Dark Ones 01.jpg\nFile:Past Dark Ones 02.jpg\nFile:Dark Ones Broken Heart 01.jpg\nFile:Dark Ones Swan Song 02.jpg\nFile:Dark Ones Crowd Swan Song.jpg\nFile:Gorgon and the Dark Ones about to send the heroes to the Underworld.png\nFile:511KillingAllTheDarkOnes.png|Zoso's Demise.\n</gallery>\n\n==External Links==\n*{{OUAT|Zoso}}\n\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{OnceUponATimeWiki}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
