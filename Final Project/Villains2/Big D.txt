However, his livery and eye color are unknown, because his appearance is shown in black and white. He is based on a [[1930]] Duesenberg, which he is apparently named after.\n\n==Role in the [[Cars Toons|series]]==\nIn ''Mater Private Eye'', Big D is making tires to cars around the country. Little does anyone know that he is actually a falsifier, as the tires are fake, causing blowouts everywhere. At the same time, Big D runs a club called the Carbacabana, having a female singer named Carmen singing for the guests, while one of his henchmen, Clyde, tries to make sure no one is bugged. [[Mia and Tia|Mia]] has also worked at the club, but she gets kidnapped by Big D, and no one knows who did it. [[Mia and Tia|Tia]] is especially upset by the disappearance of her twin sister, and goes to ask private eye [[Mater]] to help find her.\n\nMeanwhile, Big D has held Mia captive at the docks, while his henchmen work on more counterfeit tires. Soon, Mater gets spotted trying to save Mia, and Big D gets a crane to lift Mater up and drop him into the sea. Immediately, the police, led by [[Lightning McQueen]], come to the scene, and Big D orders his workers to stop them. However, Tia rescues Mater, who then swings a crane around and drop a crate of counterfeit tires on Big D. With his crime revealed, the police send Big D to prison.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBigD.PNG\nBig-d-cars-toon-martin-detective-prive-02.jpg\nBig-d-cars-toon-martin-detective-prive-03.jpg\nBig D getting arrested.jpg|Big D about to be arrested\nMater_P.I.,_Lieutenant_McQueen_and_Big_D_Disney_Store.jpg|Disney Store\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although he is wealthy, Big D is shown to talk slangy, as shown by his quote \"You ain't telling the DA nothing.\"\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:pixar:Big D|Pixar Wiki: Big D]]\n*[[w:c:worldofcarsdrivein:Big D|World of Cars Wiki: Big D]]\n\n{{Cars}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Cars characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]"
