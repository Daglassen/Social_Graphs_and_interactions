The former ruler of [[Toad Tower]], Grime was charged with overseeing the frogs of [[Wartwood Swamp|Wartwood]], though his ruthless and tyrannical governing was a point of contention. He recruited the human [[Sasha Waybright]] as his lieutenant upon her arrival in [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]], and with her aid, reprioritized his goals to taking over the kingdom of [[Newtopia]] and the world at large. However after finding out [[King Andrias]] is in reality a monstrous despot bent on conquering other worlds, he reforms and joins Sasha in a rebellion against him.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nAs seen in \"[[Prison Break]]\", Grime feels that he must be quite respective with\u00a0his discipline towards\u00a0his own crew of knights, and before when Sasha told him that his army might cooperate and listen better\u00a0if he\u00a0were nicer as Grime usually acts rude not to mention, disrespectful to his army. Most likely because he expected it would toughen them up by using\u00a0his less impressive words. However, this only ended with\u00a0the\u00a0all other\u00a0toads feeling weaker and ever since then, Grime has been trying his best as he\u00a0continues showing more respect to honor the loyalty of his soldiers ergo in return, they strictly follow his commands.\n\nDespite his villainy, Grime isn't completely heartless, as he seems to genuinely care for Sasha since she saved him from a heron, as he rescued her from the tower and looked furious when she appeared injured. Also, Grime does see Sasha as his friend because she accepts him for who he is and he does with her in return. Through his friendship with Sasha, Grime goes through a change of heart as he discovers what it truly means to be a friend and to do what's right.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nCaptain Grime is a large green toad. With a more slight terrifying appearance than any other of the toads, he possesses one glowing yellowish left\u00a0eye while his right one is injured with a scar leading down lower mouth and has sharp yellow teeth. He wears brownish armored clothes with a dark cape.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n== Role in the series ==\n=== Season 1 ===\nAfter Sasha is transported to Amphibia, she captured and place into the position of Grime.
