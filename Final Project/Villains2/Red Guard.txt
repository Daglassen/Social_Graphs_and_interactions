It is assumed that Sentries are the updated versions of guards. They use long Light Staffs to stun programs and also to block attacks. They haven't demonstrated the use of their [[Identity Disc|identity discs]] as weapons. Their primary function is acting as security for the MCP and [[the Grid]]. They are used to escort conscripts to the games from their cells. They also search for and round up any rogue programs.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Guard is called \"Warrior\" in the [[1982]]\u00a0Tron toyline.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nRed Gaurds.jpg\nRed Gaurd 2.jpg\nTron Warrior.jpg\nTron-disneyscreencaps.com-206.jpg\nTron-disneyscreencaps.com-773.jpg|[[CLU]] captured by a Glitch Guard.\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-3758.jpg|Flynn meets up with the Glitch Guards.\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-4549.jpg\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-7394.jpg\nTron-disneyscreencaps.com-9316.jpg\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-8298.jpg|Tron shoves a Glitch Guard over the edge.\n</gallery>\n\n{{TronWiki}}\n{{Tron}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Tron characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Programs]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
