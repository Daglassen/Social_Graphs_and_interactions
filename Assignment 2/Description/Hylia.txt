He sought to take the Triforce for himself by force. The goddess feared for her people. She used her power to send both them and the Triforce into the sky on a slice of earth she cut away from the land. This floating rock became the new home of our people.

However, its location has been kept secret. Even I do not know where it rests now. Oh, but the goddess did entrust me with a hint as to the Triforce's location. The clue is a song, meant to be played on the harp you hold. It is known as the {{Color|SS Red|Song of the Hero}}.|Levias|SS}}</ref> The goddess appointed a dragon to protect each region of the Surface: [[Faron (Dragon)|Faron]] to watch over the [[Faron Woods|woods]], [[Eldin (Dragon)|Eldin]] to watch over the [[Eldin Volcano|mountains]], and [[Lanayru (Dragon)|Lanayru]] to watch over the [[Lanayru Desert|desert]].<ref>{{Cite|[Thunder Dragon?] Hah!

However, Zelda was not aware of her previous existence as the goddess until she was tossed out of the sky and onto the [[Hyrule|Surface]] by [[Ghirahim]]'s tornado.

Link, the goddess's chosen hero, manages to activate a second Gate of Time and reaches the era where Hylia has just sealed away Demise.

I used you.|Princess Zelda|SS}}</ref> and so the goddess, knowing that the hero would \"throw himself headfirst into any danger, without even a moment's doubt\" if it meant saving Zelda,<ref name=\"Awaken\"/> used Link so that he would be able to wield the Triforce.<ref name=\"Awaken\"/> Her Grace apologizes for the way she had to involve him in all of it, but is prepared to pay for her actions.<ref>{{Cite|All that may be well intentioned and true, but it doesn't mean it's right...and it doesn't excuse my actions. But I'm prepared to pay the price for what I've done.|Princess Zelda|SS}}</ref> She proceeds to seal herself into a crystal and sleep for thousands of years to ensure Demise's imprisonment holds, and tells Link that he must find and use the Triforce to destroy Demise so that she will be able to awaken in their own time.<ref>{{Cite|When Demise is finally gone, there will be no more need for the seal that binds him, and then I'll be able to wake up.

But this time, when all of this is over, will you come to wake me up?|Princess Zelda|SS}}</ref>\n\nLink succeeds in obtaining the Triforce and wishes for the destruction of Demise. He then rushes into the Sealed Temple to witness Zelda's awakening,<ref>{{Cite|In light of these factors, the seal Zelda maintained through her agelong sleep is no longer necessary.

He has his troops attack Link to keep the hero at bay while he works, but Link manages to reach the center and fights Ghirahim, successfully defeating him. Ghirahim, however, reveals that while the two were fighting, the ritual continued, and the Imprisoned rises, absorbing Zelda's soul and returning to his original form: the Demon King, Demise.<ref>{{Cite|Ah... But never mind that. Victory is still mine to savor. While we fought, the ritual I started continued... At last, it's complete! The demon king shall devour the soul of the goddess and resurrect in his full glory!|Ghirahim|SS}}</ref>\n\nAfter Link seals Demise's consciousness within the Master Sword, peace returns to the land, and Zelda as well as the young hero return to their own time. Zelda mentions to Link that she had fantasized about the surface for so long that she wants to remain there and watch over the Triforce, and asks what Link's intentions are for the future.<ref>{{Cite|Look around us! As a child, I always dreamed of a world below. I wanted to see the surface with my own eyes and feel the land's warm breeze on my skin. I... I think I want to live here.

Future women born into her royal bloodline would frequently be named after her mortal incarnation for generations, while it would seem the humans named [[Hylians]], [[Lake Hylia]], the [[Great Hylian Bridge]], the [[Hylia River]] and [[Mount Hylia]] would be named after her goddess incarnation.\n\nHylia also has a great presence in {{BotW}}'s Hyrule.
