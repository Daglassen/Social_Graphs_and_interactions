== Biography ==

Teli is a treasure hunter and a merchant who deals in Guardian parts. Teli travels between Fort Hateno and Hateno Village, selling parts he acquires from broken Guardians near the Fort. He normally sells Ancient Screws, Ancient Springs, and Ancient Gears, though on rainy days he expands his shop inventory to include Ancient Shafts and Ancient Cores. As the road to Hateno Village is full of Bokoblins, Link can rescue Teli if they attack him and he will reward Link with either Food or Elixirs, a random free Item from his shop inventory, or Rupees. He stays at The Great Ton Pu Inn when visiting Hateno Village, and can be found sitting on a chair inside.
Teli is familiar with Robbie and the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab and reveals he has sold parts to him. He even wonders if Robbie is planning to rebuild a Guardian, indicating he is unaware that Robbie is using the parts to develop Ancient Soldier Gear to combat Guardians and Ancient weaponry to oppose Calamity Ganon.
