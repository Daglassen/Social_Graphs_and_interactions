It's badder. Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. Incredible!|[[Syndrome]] before revealing himself to [[Mr. Incredible]]}}\nThe '''Omnidroid v.9''' is a robot that appears in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]\u2022[[Pixar]]'s [[2004]] animated film, ''[[The Incredibles]]''. It was the ninth prototype of the\u00a0Omnidroids\u00a0created by\u00a0[[Syndrome]], bigger and heavily modified from the previous [[Omnidroid v.8|V.8]] when it was defeated by [[Mr. Incredible]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Incredibles]]''===\nThe Omnidroid v.9 only made a minor appearance in the film. It ambushed Mr. Incredible in the conference room and threw him outside into the jungle. It easily overpowered him, seemingly anticipating his moves, before catching him in its claws. It was about to use its claws to behead him, thus finishing him off, when its creator, Syndrome, intervened to reveal himself to his former childhood hero. Syndrome disabled the robot's claws to do so, and then had the Omnidroid throw him back on the ground. As Mr. Incredible and Syndrome fought, they eventually left the disengaged Omnidroid behind. The Omnidroid v.9 was never defeated, but it was used as the basis for the [[Omnidroid v.10]], presumably upgraded to have its sensor support a laser cannon and to be capable of being transported from [[Nomanisan Island]] to Metroville. It is unknown what was done to the Omnidroid v.9.\n\n===[[The Incredibles (video game)|Video game]]===\nThe Omnidroid v.9 appears in the [[The Incredibles (video game)|video game of the same name]] as a boss in the tenth level \"Great Falls\". Like the first Omnidroid boss, its appearance is slightly different as seen in the film. It has a yellow \"visor\" instead of orange and a greyish green body instead of black. In the game, the Omnidroid features attacks and abilities that do not appear in the film. Like the first Omnidroid boss, it can fire lasers from its visors, spin its whole body like a spinning top, and can also launch its claws as spinning blades at the player.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\n4k-incredibles-animationscreencaps.com-9315.jpg|[[Mr. Incredible]] meets the Omnidroid v.9.\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-5977.jpg\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-5978.jpg\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-5987.jpg|''\"It's bigger...\"''\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-5992.jpg|''\"It's badder...\"''\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-5994.jpg\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-6000.jpg\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-6004.jpg|''\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. Incredible!\"''\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-6017.jpg\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-6063.jpg\nincredibles-disneyscreencaps.com-6077.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Video games===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nOmnidroid v.9 - Video Game 3.png|The Omnidroid .v9 in ''The Incredibles'' video game\nOmnidroid v.9 - Video Game 4.png\nOmnidroid v.9 - Video Game 5.png\nOmnidroid v.9 - Video Game 6.png\nOmnidroid v.9 - Video Game 7.png\nOmnidroid v.9 - Video Game 8.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nOmnidroid v.9.png\nIncredibles Game Concept - Omnidroid 9 3.jpg\nIncredibles Game Concept - Omnidroid 9 2.jpg\nIncredibles Game Concept - Omnidroid 9 1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Incredibles}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:The Incredibles characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
