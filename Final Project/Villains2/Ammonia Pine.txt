One day she accidentally inhaled the fumes of an experimental bathroom disinfectant. The fumes had a strange effect on her and turned her into a cleaning-obsessed villain. She was later recruited by [[F.O.W.L.]] for their dastardly plans. She hates, and is even afraid of, dirt. She has a sister named [[Ample Grime]], also a F.O.W.L. agent.\n\nAmmonia Pine appears as the primary villain in only one episode--\"[[Dirty Money]]\" (the 3rd episode in production order). Her other two appearances, \"[[Cleanliness is Next to Badliness]]\" and \"[[Dirtysomething]]\", featured her paired with [[Steelbeak]] and Ample Grime respectively. She also makes cameo appearances in \"[[Ghoul of My Dreams]]\", \"[[In Like Blunt]]\" and \"[[Time and Punishment]]\".\n\n===Comics===\nAmmonia Pine never actually appeared in any of the ''Darkwing Duck'' comics published when the show was originally airing. She finally appeared in the comics in the form of a brief cameo in \"[[Crisis on Infinite Darkwings]]\", the second arc of the ''[[Darkwing Duck (Boom! Studios)|Darkwing Duck]]'' comic by [[Boom! Studios]]. She also appears alongside fellow F.O.W.L. agents [[Hotshot and Flygirl]] in \"[[F.O.W.L. Disposition]]\". In that arc, she manages to capture [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]] and [[Honker Muddlefoot|Honker]] but ends up getting turned into a pile of mud by [[Morgana Macawber]].\n\nAmmonia reappears in the ''DuckTales''/''Darkwing Duck'' crossover story \"[[Dangerous Currency]]\", with no explanation of how she returned to her normal form, where she is a member of the \"League of Eve-il\" along with [[Magica De Spell]], [[Cinnamon Teal]], and [[Camille Chameleon]]. They are in an alliance with the [[Phantom Blot]], the Fearsome Four, and the [[Beagle Boys]]. They are also later joined by [[Negaduck]] when it is revealed that he is the source of the evil slime Magica and the Blot have been using to take over Duckburg and St. Canard. However, the crossover, which was not approved by Disney, is considered non-canon, so Ammonia's whereabouts following \"F.O.W.L. Disposition\" are officially unknown as of this writing.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Her name is, of course, a reference to the cleaning chemical Ammonia (NH3) which is used to clean porcelain, glass, and steel surfaces without leaving streaks. The surname, Pine, was most likely chosen for the fact that some cleaning products famously use a pine scent such as ''Pine-Sol'', ''Pinalen,'' and ''Pine-O-Pine''.\n* Her behavior and weakness seem to imply that she might have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAmmonia Pine02.jpg\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h07m00s201.png|Ammonia with her sister Ample Grime\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h08m42s197.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h11m50s28.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h12m28s154.png|Ammonia with Steelbeak\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h13m46s161.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h14m04s89.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h14m21s255.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h14m32s112.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h15m52s146.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h16m12s93.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h16m24s218.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h16m55s8.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h17m31s111.png\nSteelBeak,_Amonia_Pine,_and_Beagle_Boys.png\nvlcsnap-2011-10-23-02h07m48s224.png\nvlcsnap-2011-10-23-02h07m58s74.png\nVlcsnap-2011-10-22-23h12m46s212.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h05m20s229.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-27-02h06m07s187.png\nVlcsnap-2011-10-22-23h07m12s196.png\nVlcsnap-2011-10-23-01h57m42s45.png\nVlcsnap-2011-10-23-01h54m45s76.png\nVlcsnap-2011-10-23-01h53m14s187.png\nVlcsnap-2011-10-23-01h52m54s249.png\nVillains unite.png\n640px-Alliance.png\nDarkwing Duck - 50 - In Like Blunt - YouTube2.jpg\n559px-The League of Eve-il.jpg\nSisters-412x400.jpg\n639px-The legue of eve-il 2.png\ndarkwingduck_11_rev__page_2.jpg\nAmmonia Pine-mud.png\n477083-vlcsnap_00648.jpg\n477092-vlcsnap_00695.jpg\n477107-vlcsnap_00766.jpg\n477108-vlcsnap_00772.jpg\n477109-vlcsnap_00774.jpg\n477110-vlcsnap_00783.jpg\nDarkwing-duck-omnibus-silvani-fa9c0.jpg\nDarkwingDuck 11 rev Page 1.jpg\nDarkwingDuck_11_rev__Page_4.jpg\nVlcsnap-2011-10-22-23h13m07s165.jpg\nGhoulofMyDreams - 095.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pine, Ammonia}}\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Custodians]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"
