Though small and adorable, they can grow to become vicious monsters that [[Mr. Sparkles]] can control.\n\n==Background==\nAfter being accused by [[Hiro Hamada|Hiro]] of supplying [[San Fransokyo]] with genetically-engineered monsters, [[Di Amara]] set out to improve her public image by taking advantage of her recent alliance with Mr. Sparkle. She created the adorable Mayoi using plant DNA to give it the ability to grow. Once they were unleashed into the city, the citizens were captivated by their cuteness, even surprisingly [[Go Go Tomago|Go Go]]. [[Hiro Hamada|Hiro]], on the other hand, was suspicious of them, and immediately suspect that Liv Amara was behind it. [[Di Amara]] also altered Mr. Sparkles' DNA using the Mayoi's plant genes, giving him control of the whole population. By doing this, Mr. Sparkles could take the fall for Liv's schemes, while she made herself look like heroine to stopping him and the Mayoi.\n\n===Behavior===\nAt infancy, the Mayoi are much like puppies and kittens who are playful and love to be fussed over. The only thing they can say is \"Mayoi\" These traits remain during mid-maturity, but become playfully destructive. When the Mayoi reaches full maturity, they are more predatory and vicious.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nAt an infancy stage, the Mayoi resemble green fluffy axolotls with stripes and fluffy tails. Their fur is, in actuality, however, fungus. Their ears resemble leaves, resembling more like plants than animals. In further stages of development, they keep mainly the same design until they are fully matured under the control of [[Mr. Sparkles]] in which their algae become sharper and its color darkens, and their eyes glow green.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mayoi is the Japanese word for \"doubt\", \"hesitation\", and \"bewilderment\". When written in kanji, Mayoi contains \u8ff7\u3044, while \"\u8ff7\" refers to \"lost\". This could be in reference to their role in presenting Sycorax as an ally to San Fransokyo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSomething Fluffy 9.jpg\nSomething Fluffy 8.jpg\nSomething Fluffy 2.png\nSomething Fluffy 4.png|Who's a fuzzy wuzzy\nSomething Fluffy 14.png\nSomething Fluffy 11.jpg\nSomething Fluffy 12.jpg\nSomething Fluffy 13.jpg\nLie Detector 14.png\nCity of Monsters - Mutant Villains.jpg\nCity of MOnsters - Orso Returns to Normal.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
