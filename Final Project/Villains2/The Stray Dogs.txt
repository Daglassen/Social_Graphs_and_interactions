She ends up in the trainyard alley where they reside. The three suddenly emerge, begin chasing, and viciously barking at her. However, [[Tramp]] notices what is going on and rushes after the dogs. The strays corner Lady in a dead-end alleyway, but Tramp intervenes and manages to distract and fight off all three of them before they could attack Lady.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Much of their barking was recycled audio from the [[Hunter Dogs]] in ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''.\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
