He is a demon that takes on the appearance of a ferocious bear that can alter a person's perception by feeding off of their fears and worries.\n\nThe Demon Bear was created by Chris Claremont and Bob McLeod.\n==Background==\nThe Demon Bear is a terrifying entity connected closely to [[Mirage (Marvel)|Dani Moonstar]]. Its origin is unknown, but it supposedly has to do with her inner spirit being corrupted and wants to consume her to feel whole again. It destroys her reservation and kills her father William before mysteriously disappearing. It manages to find her in an abandoned hospital where it kills her captor, [[Cecilia Reyes|Dr. Cecilia Reyes]]. The Demon Bear proceeds to battle Dani's new friends [[Magik|Illyana Rasputin]], [[Cannonball (Marvel)|Sam Guthrie]], [[Sunspot|Roberto da Costa]] and [[Wolfsbane|Rahne Sinlair]]. Dani eventually overcomes the Demon Bear by talking down to it and accepting her newfound gifts. The Demon Bear becomes docile and finally rests; dissipating just as the sun is rising.\n===Abilities===\n* '''Negative emotion empowerment''': The Demon Bear appears to be affected by how others perceive it, specifically by Dani. It preys on her fear of it and her wanting to run away. The more people fight against it, the stronger it becomes.\n* '''Teleportation''': The Demon Bear appears to have some limited teleportation as it can appear and reappear at will.\n* '''Strength and Durability''': The Demon Bear is exceedingly strong and durable to a large degree and is almost unstoppable.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the comics, the Demon Bear was actually a corrupted entity that was composed of Dani's parents William and Peg Lonestar. A strike from Magik's Soulsword was enough to dissipate the entity and freeing them. It continued to make reappearances in other forms such as Apache spirits, where it fought Warpath and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], and took over Bishop, where it was defeated by Psylocke. Afterwards, it became a docile being.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDemon Bear New Mutants still.jpg\nRender 7.png|Demon Bear Render\n</gallery>\n==External links==\n*{{WP}}\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Stub]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:X-Men Cinematic Universe]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
