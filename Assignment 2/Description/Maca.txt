Maca can be found outside the entrance of the [[Great Deku Tree]], and provides [[Link]] with information about the forest and [[Master Sword]].  Maca tells Link that the Master Sword may lose power if overused, but will regenerate over time.<ref>{{Cite|Well the {{Color|BotW Blue|Master Sword}} is a very special weapon, but it can lose its power if you overuse it.<br>When that happens, don't panic. All you have to do is wait for its power to regenerate.|Maca|BotW}}</ref> When Link asks about leaving the forest, Maca questions why he would want to leave this perfect place.<ref>{{Cite|You want to leave the forest? But why? It's perfect here!|Maca|BotW}}</ref> Regardless, Maca tells Link that he can leave the woods by warping through the mouth of an Ogre Tree east from the sword pedestal.<ref>{{Cite|If you head east from the {{Color|BotW Red|sword pedestal}}, there will be a sign on your right. Climb up the hill on the right side of the sign, and you'll see an {{Color|BotW Red|ogre tree}}. If you walk into that tree's mouth, you'll *whoosh* be taken to the entrance of the woods.|Maca|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Maca's leaf mask and appearance resemble [[Hollo]] from {{TWW}}.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Names\n|align= left\n|enBr= \n|enBrM= \n|ja= \n|jaM= \n|esS= \n|esSM= \n|esL= \n|esLM= \n|frF= Makus\n|frFM= \n|frC= \n|frCM= \n|de= \n|deM= \n|it= \n|itM= \n|ptP= \n|ptPM= \n|ptB= \n|ptBM= \n|nl= \n|nlM= \n|ru= \n|ruM= \n|ko= \n|koM= \n|zhT= \n|zhTM= \n|zhS= \n|zhSM= }}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Koroks\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
