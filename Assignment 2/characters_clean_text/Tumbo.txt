Tumbo is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==

Tumbo is a Zora who lives in Zora's Domain, where he can be found running around the statue of Mipha during the day. When he first meets Link, he is confused by his appearance, and explains that he's never met a Hylian before. He asks if he's seen his mother, Mei, on his journey.
After Divine Beast Vah Ruta is freed from Calamity Ganon's control, Tumbo can give Link the "Frog Catching" Side Quest. Tumbo asks Link to give him five Hot-Footed Frogs in exchange for an Armoranth. He does this so he can sell the Hot-Footed Frogs in order to make money while his mother is away.
