Revali is a recurring character in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]


== Biography ==
Revali is known for his arrogant, sardonic outward personality, which is especially apparent when around Link. He is often boastful about his capabilities and is often unwilling to admit defeat when he gets bested by an opponent, claiming he wasn’t trying his best such as when he was defeated by Windblight Ganon, where he claimed he was “only winging it”. His resentment towards Link is due to envy of his higher position as well as his lack of expression rubbing him the wrong way.
100 years prior to the events of Breath of the Wild, Revali was the Champion of the Rito tribe. He was known as the most skilled archer of all the Rito and could fire Arrows with the speed of a gale. Revali has the ability to create an impressive updraft that allows him to soar, later named Revali's Gale after him. His weapon was the Great Eagle Bow.
Revali was present during the ritual of Princess Zelda making Link her appointed knight in Link's first Recovered Memory. After Daruk commented on the depressing delivery of Zelda's speech, Revali reminds Daruk that the "ceremonial pomp, grandeur, and nonsense" was his idea in the first place. Revali then states his disapproval of Link until Urbosa tells him to stop.
Later on, in Link's second Recovered Memory, Link visits Rito Village. Revali confronts Link and openly admits that despite wanting to stop Ganon, he does not like the idea of merely assisting Link just because he wields the Master Sword. Revali believes he is more skilled than the young hero. After gloating about how his abilities are superior, Revali suggests they compete one on one atop the Divine Beast Vah Medoh. Revali then mocks Link for not even being able to make it there on his own and soars upward to Medoh.
In Link's 15th Recovered Memory, Revali was seen with the rest of the Champions meeting Link and Zelda after her time in the Spring of Wisdom on Mount Lanayru. Minutes later, there was a loud rumble and Revali flew into the air to discover that Calamity Ganon had finally awakened. At Daruk's command, he and the rest of the Champions hastened to their Divine Beasts. Despite his best efforts, Revali was defeated by Windblight Ganon. Like the rest of the Champions, his spirit was imprisoned within the corrupt Divine Beast for the next century.
After Link's victory over Windblight Ganon, Revali is freed and gains a grudging respect for the hero. He thanks and congratulates Link on succeeding where he has failed and acknowledges Link as a warrior worthy of Revali's Gale. After Link leaves, Revali flies Medoh, landing on top of the giant stone perch above Rito Village. He sets Medoh's sights on Hyrule Castle.
An amiibo based on Revali was released on November 10, 2017. This amiibo is compatible with Breath of the Wild's DLC packs.

== Trivia ==
During a bonus session of the documentary about the making of Breath of the Wild, sound director Hajime Wakai stated that Revali is his favorite character.
His final line before flying off to Medoh in the second memory was different between versions. In the Japanese version, he merely laughed derisively as he flew away. In the English version, he instead sarcastically bade Link good luck in sealing away the darkness as he flew off.
The Spirit Battle for the Zelda (Breath of the Wild) Support Spirit references the plot of Breath of the Wild. Four Fighters resembling the Champion must be defeated before Link and Princess Zelda appear. In this Spirit Battle, Revali is represented by Falco.
