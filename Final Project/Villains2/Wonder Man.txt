As Wonder Man, he was highly unstable due to the physical change his body had undergone and was willing to join with villainy to become human again. However, he does still retain some respect for the people who tried to help him with his condition such as Ant-Man and chose not to engage in direct combat most of the time. He is albeit more moral than his teammates. His personality seems to have softened later on as Black Panther was able to convince him to change his ways.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nBefore becoming Wonder Man, Simon wears a regular business suit and has black hair and blue eyes. As Wonder Man, his body is all purple based from the comics but with no \"W\" in it and has no hair and red eyes.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\nOriginally, Simon was a human with no superhuman abilities. However, he was a successful scientist and businessman. After being infused with ionic energy, Simon became a being composed completely of said energy, which granted him a variety of superhuman powers. He possesses incredible physical strength and is nearly invulnerable. He was also able to fly and could produce incredibly powerful energy blasts from his hands. Finally, Simon was also able to rapidly grow in size, allowing him to exceed even Giant-Man's maximum height.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===\nAt the beginning of\u00a0\"[[Everything is Wonderful]]\", it was shown that Tony Stark had bought Simon's\u00a0company, but it was so until Tony revealed that he can save it since it \"wasn't going to survive\" meaning that Simon's company is going bankrupt.\n\nSimon, however, is unaware of this and is angry and frustrated. Feeling powerless, he turns to his brother Eric who brings him to [[A.I.M.]], he is confronted by\u00a0[[MODOK|M.O.D.O.C.]]\u00a0who has the A.I.M. units turn him into Wonder Man. He ends up fighting Iron Man while\u00a0Ant-Man tries to reason with him. When Wonder Man starts to destabilize, Iron Man tries to get him to his buildings Arc Reactor, but it is too late as Wonder Man fully destabilizes and disappears, which makes Tony feel very sad and disappointed when all that he wanted was to work with him. After the Avengers left, Enchantress re-assembled Wonder Man and recruited him for the Master of Evil in exchange to remain alive.\n\nWith no choice, he agreed. He was with them fighting the Avengers below the Avengers Mansion which ends with their defeat. When tasked by Zemo to guard the Norn Stone in a graveyard, he was reasoned with by Black Panther about his purpose. Convinced, he left the graveyard as the Dark Elves emerged from the ground. In Acts of Vengeance, he is seen being hunted along with the other Masters of Evil. He, Baron Zemo, and Abomination appear at the mansion for help. Black Panther convinced him to leave Zemo's side and that Tony Stark found a cure for his condition. Near the end of the episode, Wonder Man is teleported away when he stops Enchantress from using a Norn stone by destroying it and redeeming himself. His fate beyond that is unknown.\n\n===''[[M.O.D.O.K. (TV series)|M.O.D.O.K.]]''===\nWonder Man is a \"pending Avenger, underwear model and lover of [M.O.D.O.K.'s] wife\" who serves as a pseudo antagonist to M.O.D.O.K. He begins to date his ex-wife [[Jodie Tarleton]] after having a chance encounter with her at a book store. Unbeknownst to him, Jodie begins to take advantage of Wonder Man; using him to get publicity for her book ''Jodify Your Life''. Upon him realizing this, he becomes heartbroken and breaks up with her; adding that she is just like her husband.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Nathan Fillion\u00a0filmed a cameo role as\u00a0Simon Williams for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', but his scenes were ultimately not used in the final cut.\n* In ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', Wonder Man is an enemy of the Avengers, in the comics he was a member of the team.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nsimonwilliams.png\nAbomination- Earth Mightiest Heroes01.png\ntumblr_lzyglmIOjH1r2wnzqo1_1280.png\nWonder_Man1.png\nWonder_Man2.png\nWonder_Man3.png\nWonder_Man4.png\nTheavengersearthsmighti_1.jpg\na7b2b667.png\nWonder_Man5.png\nWonder_Man6.png\nMastersofevil.png\ntheavengersearthsmightif.jpg\n1278461.jpg\naemh_ss04.jpg\naemh_ss45.jpg\naemh_ss59.jpg\naemh_ss40.jpg\nmastersofevil_ss48.jpg\nthe-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes-volume-3-20111031022935724.jpg\nAIP-2011-12-23-22h15m39s99.jpg\nAvengersemhtvspot3.png\nWonder_Man12.png\nWonder_Man_(Earth_Mightiest_Heroes).JPG\nTumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno2_1280.png\n4dade10a15936.jpg\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno10_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno1_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno3_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno4_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno5_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno6_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno7_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno8_1280.png\ntumblr_nvqc9tfqnq1rl14rno9_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno1_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno2_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno3_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno4_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno5_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno6_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno7_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno8_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno9_1280.png\ntumblr_o1unq59BO01rl14rno10_1280.png\nClassic Wonder Man.PNG\nSimon Williams in his boxers AEMH.png|Simon in his boxers.\nEnchantress And Wonder Man's Last Moments.png|Wonder Man's last moments with the Enchantress just before meeting their demises (even though the Enchantress survived).\n</gallery>\n\n===''M.O.D.O.K''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nM.O.D.O.K.-Wonder Man Card.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Comics===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\n2741256-wonderman1.jpg\nWonderman-1-.gif\n</gallery>\n\n===Video Games===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nWonder_Man_Portrait_Art.png|Wonder Man in [[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:M.O.D.O.K. characters]]"
