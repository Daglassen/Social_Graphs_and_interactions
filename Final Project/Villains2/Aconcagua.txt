[[Pedro (character)|Pedro]] tried to avoid him while getting the mail and almost got hurt. He survives and makes it back home with the mail.\n\n===Comics===\nA mountain-inspired by Aconcagua can be seen in the comic ''El Kid Pampeador'', of the Italian Disney comics authors Guido Martina and Luciano Bottaro (code INDUCKS '''[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=I+TL++219-AP I TL 219-AP]'''), but it isn't explicitly mentioned as Aconcagua.\n\n===Television===\nA non-anthropomorphic Aconcagua makes an appearance in the ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'' premiere episode \"[[To Grandma with Love]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the real world, Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the Americas at 6,962 m (22,841 ft). It is located in the Andes mountain range, in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of Mendoza and it lies 112 kilometers (70 miles) west by north of its capital, the city of Mendoza. The summit is also located about five kilometers from San Juan Province and 15 kilometers from the international border with [[Chile]]. It is the highest peak in both the Western and Southern Hemispheres. It is one of the Seven Summits (the highest mountains of the seven continents).\n*It is not clarified if Aconcagua is supposed to be an anthropomorphic mountain (quite like [[Uku]] from the short\u00a0''[[Lava]]''), or if the scary face that can be seen on it is just a hallucination from Pedro, like the Forest Trees from\u00a0''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.\n*In \"Steady Effort\", an episode of ''[[Sing Me a Story with Belle]]'' which featured the ''Pedro'' segment, he is referred to as '''Mount Grande''' as his real name would have been most likely difficult to pronounce amongst its target audience.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTumblr m0y991bD5P1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n015A-033dangerviewer.jpg\nTumblr nhu2edwzH01qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n[[fr:Aconcagua]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Saludos Amigos characters]]\n[[Category:Mountains]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
