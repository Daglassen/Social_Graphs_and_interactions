Henchmen that are ruled by [[Prince John]],\u00a0they are known to be gruff and rather stupid, but underneath their hard exterior, they are fun-loving and like to play jokes on each other. So far, their only appearances are in Disney's ''Robin Hood'' and ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''===\nThe Rhino Guards are first seen during the film's opening credits. Later during the movie, they are seen marching in a procession in back of the lead crocodile (who could presumably be [[Captain Crocodile]], as he looks just like him except for wearing red shoes instead of green ones)\u00a0along with\u00a0some elephants and hippos.\n\nIn one scene,\u00a0four Rhino Guards are seen guarding a treasure chest filled with gold farthings. [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]] (disguised as a woman fortune teller) manages to distract [[Prince John]] long enough for [[Little John]] (disguised as a maid) to steal the gold from the chest without being spotted by the Rhino Guards. One Rhino Guard notices the disguised Little John and, believing he is an attractive damsel, wolf-whistles to him. When Prince John finds out that he has been robbed by the two outlaws, he commands the Rhino Guards to go after them, which they do. However,\u00a0Robin Hood and Little John manage to escape the Rhino Guards.\n\nIn another scene, Rhino Guards are seen on either side of Prince John's throne during\u00a0an archery tournament that soon commences. One guard is also seen marching with other animals as a contestant in the tournament. Robin Hood (now disguised as a stork) manages to win the archery tournament. However, Prince John somehow sees through Robin Hood's disguise and gestures to Captain Crocodile, who whispers something in one of the Rhino Guard's ear. The Rhino Guards follow Robin Hood as he steps up to Prince John for him to declare him the winner. Unfortunately, the prince instead rips off Robin Hood's disguise and commands the Rhino Guards to seize him and tie him up. When Robin Hood\u00a0proclaims that [[King Richard]] is the rightful king, Prince John furiously calls the Rhino executioner to behead Robin Hood. Before the Rhino executioner can do so, Little John holds a small sword behind Prince John's back and forces him to set Robin Hood free.\n\nAfter the Rhino Guards release him, however, Prince John demands them to kill Robin Hood due to the fact that the Sheriff of Nottingham discovering and engaging Little John, and the Rhino Guards give chase once again. Little John fights\u00a0a few\u00a0of the Rhino Guards and manages to poke\u00a0one of them in the ribs with\u00a0a staff, causing him to groan.\u00a0One Rhino Guard is seen attacking Robin Hood off-screen. [[Lady Kluck]] then jabs the Rhino Guard in the buttocks with the Golden Arrow, causing him to scream\u00a0in pain and runoff. Later,\u00a0a number of Rhino Guards who are chasing after the innocent citizens of [[Nottingham]] can be seen crashing through a tent with hippos. When Lady Kluck attacks Prince John as well, the\u00a0prince demands the Rhino Guards to \"seize the fat one.\" They then try to tackle Lady Kluck as if they were playing football, but she manages to defeat them all and escape. A particular Rhino Guard almost caught her when she was in the air, but missed and slid until he crashed into a rock.  \n\nThe Rhino Guards are later seen chasing the citizens of Nottingham when they attempt to escape from jail. Prior to them giving chase, Prince John says, \"Guards! To the jail!\" However, the Rhino Guards come pouring out faster than Prince John expected and unintentionally\u00a0run into\u00a0the prince as they crash through the gate, despite Prince John telling them to cease and desist. A group of Rhino Guards\u00a0can later be seen knocked over like bowling pins when Robin Hood releases several barrels of wine that run the Rhino Guards down.\n\nSeveral of the Rhino Guards follow [[Sheriff of Nottingham|the Sheriff of Nottingham]] as they pursue Robin Hood, only for the latter to kick the fat wolf into the guards, before the last four are seen throwing spears at Robin. It is unknown what happens to them after King Richard returns, they either got imprisoned or changed their alliance to him.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Rhinos appear in several episodes of the series as guests.  In several episodes, a pair of them are usually seen running with several Disney characters, usually in and/or out of the club (the Rhinos are located between [[Grumpy]] before them and Captain Crocodile at the very end).  \n\nIn the episode \"[[Dining Goofy]]\" for example,\u00a0the Rhino Guards are seen running out of the club with other various Disney characters, without noticing that they're running over [[Donald Duck]], from the [[House of Mouse (night club)|House of Mouse]] due to [[Goofy]]'s \"helping\" and especially his annoying [[Hawaii]]an music playing. Sooner or later, they are seen coming back with the same various Disney characters to the House of Mouse, again without noticing Donald.\n\n=== ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' ===\nIn \"[[The Brave Little Squire]]\", a group of Rhino Guards were present at the honoring of Sir [[Mortimer Mouse]].  The Rhino Executioner (who has the same color scheme as the other Rhino Guards in this episode) was later shown among the ''Robin Hood'' characters that were displeased at Mortimer's cowardice.  They later trampled him while celebrating [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] when he defeated the dragon.  Another Rhino Guard was shown enjoying Mortimer's shaming at the end.  \n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Robin Hood}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
