He's signing for divorce papers and she is very lustful. She just wants to make out all the time and not bother about any aspects of life.\n==Role in the film==\nCharlotte is less than happy about having Michael's son, [[Mimi-Siku Cromwell|Mimi-Siku]], in their apartment, as she is a very conceited New Yorker who believes her way is the best. She openly pleads with Michael saying she can't watch Mimi and he assures her saying it'll be easy, that Mimi's a man, that he can look after himself, and when he comes back home they can make out, which she likes.\n\nCharlotte is sleeping practically almost naked when Mimi creeps into her bed and looks at her crotch. She smiles, thinking it's Michael, but then wakes up and screams upon seeing Mimi. He says she has a nice \"puchi-puchi\" (vagina) and she starts backing away from him and says, \"That's the last puchi-puchi\" you'll see around here, you little savage!\"\n\nTo add to Charlotte's displeasure, Mimi spies on her in the shower and sets off his pet tarantula, [[Maitika]], into the stall. It scares her, she tries to kill it, and it tries to break in through the door.\n\nCharlotte isn't seen again afterward; at least until the end when Michael dumps her and says he's going back to his first wife, Patricia. It can be assumed these two combined accidents triggered like a collision.\n\n{{Jungle 2 Jungle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Jungle 2 Jungle characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
