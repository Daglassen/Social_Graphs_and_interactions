It is a rabid one who gives [[Old Yeller (character)|Old Yeller]] rabies before getting shot by [[Travis Coates|Travis]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nWhen the wolf attacks, [[Katie Coates|Katie]] and [[Lisbeth Searcy|Lisbeth]]'s screams alert Travis, who runs outside with his rifle and sees Old Yeller fighting it off. Travis is able to shoot it, but not before it bites Old Yeller, and Katie sadly informs him that it, which attacked without provocation, was rabid. At his pleading, she agrees to keep Old Yeller penned in the corn crib for a few weeks to chart his progress, hoping he will remain unaffected. At first, he seems healthy, but one night he growls viciously at Travis, who tries to hide the affliction from Katie and Arliss.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nOld Yeller vs the Wolf.jpg|The Wolf wrestling with Old Yeller\nOld-yeller-disneyscreencaps.com-7961.jpg\nOld-yeller-disneyscreencaps.com-8025.jpg|The Wolf after getting shot by Travis\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The dog that performed the wolf in this film was a not a genuine wolf at all. It was actually a purebred German Shepherd. Makeup artists designed a costume and mask of a wolf. Both of these dogs were trained to play-fight and muzzled for that sequence.\n\n{{Old Yeller}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolf, The}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Old Yeller characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
