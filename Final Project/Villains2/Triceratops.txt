It has appeared in a few Disney projects.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nMany Triceratops appear in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of\u00a0''[[Fantasia]]'' as adults and babies. They move in herds to find food. Many were seen running when the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] attacks, one of which ran into a lake to swim away as three [[Brachiosaurus|Brachiosaurs]] dived down to avoid the T-Rex as well. During the drought at the end of the segment, Triceratops walks with other dinosaurs to find more food and water, but all of them end up going extinct from starvation and dehydration.\n\n===''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''===\nA [[Triceratops (Tarzan)|Triceratops]] appeared in an episode of ''The Legend of Tarzan''\u00a0as one of the first dinosaurs [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and company encounter, when it charges at them.\n\n===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]''===\nA Triceratops\u00a0also appears in ''The Little Mermaid'' episode \"[[Land of the Dinosaurs]]\" along with [[Apatosaurus]], [[Stegosaurus]], and [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]].\n\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\n{{Main|Tootsie the Triceratops}}\n\n===''[[Dinosaurs]]''===\n{{Main|Bradley P. Richfield}}\n\n===''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks]]''===\nIn the episode \"[[Jurassic Puck]]\", a pair of Triceratops were one of the few dinosaurs brought to life by [[Lord Dragaunus]] from a test tube in the laboratory. Then later start rampaging in Anaheim.\n\n===[[Toy Story]]\u00a0franchise===\n{{Main|Trixie}}\n\n===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===\n\n==== [[Disneyland]] ====\nA family of Triceratops is seen watching their eggs hatch\u00a0during the [[Primeval World]] diorama on the [[Disneyland Railroad]].\n\n==== [[Walt Disney World]] ====\nAt [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], the spinner attraction [[TriceraTop Spin]] of [[DinoLand U.S.A.|DinoLand, U.S.A. ]]features tin-toy triceratops vehicles for a [[Dumbo the Flying Elephant|Dumbo]]-esque spinner.  These being themed around a roadside attraction at the Chester & Hester's Dino-Rama amusement-park.\n\nSeveral triceratops were shown on the \"Theories of Extinction\" mural when it was displayed in the queue for [[Dinosaur (attraction)|Dinosaur]] until it was replaced in the most recent refurbishment.  \n\n==== [[Tokyo Disneyland]] ====\nThe skeleton of a Triceratops can be seen in the rock-work of [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad|Big Thunder Mountain]] from the Disneyland Railroad, being visible right before entering the Primeval World display.\n\n==Trivia==\n*''Triceratops'' was incorrectly shown to have legs that sprawled out like those of a lizard. In real life, ''Triceratops'' had legs directly underneath its body like those of a rhino.\n*There are currently two species of ''Triceratops'' known from the fossil record, ''T.horridus'' and ''T.prorsus''.\n*At one point in time, ''Triceratops'' was often believed to be a younger version of another ceratopsian, ''[[wikipedia:Torosaurus|Torosaurus]]''. This was mostly due to the fact that they were in the same subgroup of ceratopsians and had lived in the same fossil formations, though ''Torosaurus'' was more common in the south and ''Triceratops'' being more common in the north. However, a study by Yale University published in [[2012]] proved that they are distinct species. \u00a0\n*In the Hell Creek Formation, a specimen of ''Triceratops'' preserved with skin impressions indicates that it may have been covered with quills or bristles in addition to scales. A similar type of pelage was found on [[wikipedia:Psittacosaurus|Psittacosaurus]], a distant relative.\u00a0\n*Triceratops was supposed to be on Disney Dinosaur as it was seen in the concept art but was cut\u00a0including its cousin, Pentaceratops.\n*Two triceratops named Sam and Will were supposed to be on [[The Good Dinosaur]] as they were seen in the toy sales but both were cut from the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nFantasia Triceratops.jpg\nBaby triceratops.JPG\nPHOTO 10806280 66470 18660554 ap.jpg\nThe group of herbivorous dinosaurs are going to run.JPG|The group of herbivorous dinosaurs are looking at [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] and they notice that it's coming towards them.\nA group of herbivorous dinosaurs about to run.JPG|Triceratops, 2 Parasaurolophus, Corythosaurus and a Plateosaurus are about to run away from the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]].\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6276.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-4547 (1).jpg|A Triceratops is watching the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] and the [[Stegosaurus]] fighting to the death, along with a [[Parasaurolophus]], [[Corythosaurus]] and [[Brachiosaurus]].\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6391.jpg\nTyrannosaurus killed the Stegosaurus.jpg|A Triceratops along with a group ([[Parasaurolophus]], [[Diplodocus]], Corythosaurus and a [[Dimetrodon]]) looking at the end of the death of the [[Stegosaurus]] after it was killed by the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]].\nFantasia1940720pmano172.png\nTriceratops and Parasaurolophus.jpg\nDSCN0769.jpg|TriceraTop Spin\nDinosaur Jubilee (04-98).jpg|2 Triceratops skeletons with the skeleton replica of Stan the T.rex in [[Dinosaur Jubilee]]\nFile:Boneyard Triceratops.JPG|Triceratops clash in the Boneyard Playground at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\nLandofthedinosaurs164.jpg\nDino-swamp-concept.jpg\nTricera-model-sheet.png\nSam the Triceratops.jpg.png\nWill the Triceratops.jpg.png\nTarzan Dinosaur book.jpg.png\nTrixie still.png\nDisney Dinosaur Concept Art 2.jpg|Original concept art for ''Dinosaur'' by William Stout\nDisney Dinosaur concept the herd in gather circle.png|Concept art ''Dinosaur''\nLand Before Swine (302).jpg|In ''[[Gravity Falls]]''\nAMNH Triceratops.jpeg|A skeleton of Triceratops at the {{WikipediaLink|American Museum of Natural History}}, [[New York City|New York, NY]]\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[wikipedia:Triceratops|Triceratops at Wikipedia]]\n*[http://www.dinosauria.ca/Dinos/triceratops.php Triceratops]\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n{{Big Thunder Mountain Railroad}}{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Characters]]"
