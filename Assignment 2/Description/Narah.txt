I love to run!|Narah|BotW}}</ref> but also enjoys conversation and will demand that {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} ask her some questions.<ref>{{Cite|I love talking! Ask me a question!|Narah|BotW}}</ref> Link can ask her three different things: who Narah cares about, what she enjoys doing, and what things she likes. Whenever she answers one of Link's questions, she will ask to keep the conversation going.<ref>{{Cite|Talk more!|Narah|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAsking who she cares about leads Narah to declare her love for her mother Nikki,<ref>{{Cite|[Who do you like?] I love my mommy!|Narah|BotW}}</ref> but she admits that the woman is always busy talking to her friend {{Term|BotW|Amira|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|But my mommy...

Shiny money! Love!|Narah|BotW}}</ref> If Link has a {{Term|BotW|sapphire|link}} in his possession, she will pause and think before recommending that he sell it.<ref>{{Cite|Huh? Mister?
