"{{Infobox character\n|image = Little Bits.JPG\n|shows = ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''\n|voice = [[G. Hannelius]]\n|occupation = Bounty hunter\n|powers = Hypnotism\n|alias=Babycakes, Bits}}'''Little Bits''' is a character from \"[[The Stray]]\". She's a kitten who is hired as a bounty hunter by [[Lord Hater]]. She used her natural hypnotism abilities to lure [[Wander]] into a trap, and is the main antagonist in her debut episode. She mostly stays silent as part of her deceptive cover, but when she talks, she speaks with a cute lisp. As of \"[[My Fair Hatey]]\", she is one of Lord Dominator's prisoners.\n==Abilities==\nLittle Bits uses her cunning mind to manipulate others. She has the power to control the thoughts and actions of her adversaries by putting them into a trance through eye-contact. Those with particularly protective or empathetic natures are more susceptible to fall under her hypnosis, as she uses her cute, vulnerable appearance as leverage through her mind-control. In the episode \"The Stray\", this ability was demonstrated on Wander.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Little Bits}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
