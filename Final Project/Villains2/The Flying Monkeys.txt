Forced to do her bidding, the Monkeys rode their motorcycles through the skies of [[Land of Oz|Oz]], performing the Witch's dirty work. Once she was defeated, [[Dorothy Gale (Muppets Wizard of Oz)|Dorothy]] returned the biker cap to [[Sal Minella]], thereby restoring the Flying Monkeys' independence.\n\n[[Johnny Fiama]], while associated with the Monkeys, is not formally a member of the group. He and [[w:c:muppets:Foo-Foo|Foo-Foo]] appear to be with the Witch by choice and are not controlled by the magic biker cap.\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flying Monkeys, The}}\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:The Muppets' Wizard of Oz characters]]"
