He gives them three instructions: to abduct Tom, drown him in the sea, and to steal [[Mary Contrary]]'s sheep (which would force her to marry Barnaby so he could get her money). After abducting Tom, they walked by a gypsy camp, and, in order to receive more money, sold him to the gypsies while leading Barnaby to believe that they drowned him.\n\nDressed as sailors, Gonzorgo and Roderigo told Mary that Tom drowned. Afterward, they stole her sheep. Barnaby held off paying them until the next day. However, that night he discovered that Tom was still alive. He angrily chased them down, telling them to not quadruple cross him and to finish Tom off for good. They followed Tom and Mary into the [[Forest of No Return]], where the sheep apparently were, and as the trees led them to [[Toyland]]. Barnaby intended to attack at several points but was interrupted each time before he could even reveal his presence.\n\nWhen [[Mr. Toymaker]]'s assistant, [[Grumio]], invented \"The Poof Gun\" which has a special formula that shrinks large items down to toy size, and Mr. Toymaker threw it out a window, Barnaby caught it, shrunk him, and placed him in a birdcage. When he said he was going to do the same to Tom, Mr. Toymaker convinced Gonzorgo and Roderigo, who seemed horrified at Barnaby's use of the Poof Gun, to try to stop him. When Gonzorgo announced that he and Roderigo no longer wanted to be part of Barnaby's horrible plot, he shrunk and imprisoned them in the birdcage as well. As he tried to force Mary to marry him by threatening to shrink Tom twice (which would destroy him), Gonzorgo and Roderigo released Tom, who led an army of toys to fight Barnaby. After his defeat, Grumio restored Gonzorgo and Roderigo to normal size.\n\nAfterward, Gonzorgo and Roderigo attended Tom and Mary's wedding.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n180px-G&R.jpg\nBarnaby with his men.png\n1961-toyland-03.png\n1961-toyland-16.png\nTumblr m1ri0wbhrA1qiceiuo1 1280.jpg\nBabesintoyland-09.jpg|Gonzorgo and Roderigo at  Tom and Mary's wedding (in front of the house)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Babes in Toyland}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Babes in Toyland characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
