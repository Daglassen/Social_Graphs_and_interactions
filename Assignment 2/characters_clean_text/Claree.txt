Claree is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Claree is a shopkeeper and a member of the Sheikah Tribe who lives in Kakariko Village, where she owns the Armor Shop, Enchanted. When Link first steps into her store, she will proudly declare that all of her items belong to a brand named the "Claree Collection" and recommends one of the pieces. If Link asks what the Claree Collection is, she will explain that the collection is curated by none other than herself. She points out that certain items have specific features. Claree is very upbeat and tells Link he can ask her about anything.
Claree is also willing to buy items from the hero. She cheers whenever Link sells her anything. She's very excited to see items from beyond Kakariko, as she doesn't get to leave the Village.
When Link decides to sell her something, Claree can react in a few different ways. She can be in shock over the item, end up thrilled, admit that she was eyeing what he sold, or proclaim that she has been looking for that particular item. She will claim to buy anything, and even suggests that Link sell anything he does not need anymore.
If Link approaches the Stealth Set, Claree says the pieces are exclusive to the store. She points out the use of its stealth capabilities, but quietly admits that its defense is lacking.
