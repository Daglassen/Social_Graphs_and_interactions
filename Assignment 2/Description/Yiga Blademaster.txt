They favor the windcleaver blade and are extremely agile despite their bulky build. At this Yiga Clan rank, they have mastered a technique that allows them to manipulate the very earth. By striking the ground, they can create stone pillars and blasts of air.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> They can be found patrolling the [[Yiga Clan Hideout]], and if they spot {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} in the hideout, they will close all doors and exits while calling in back up. After [[Master Kohga]] is defeated, they will also start appearing randomly to attack Link.\n\nYiga Blademasters attack with [[Windcleaver]]s that send blasts of air at long distances. They can also create fissures that produce updrafts that Link can use to glide before a stone pillar emerges from them. A shot to the head with the [[Bow]] can stun Yiga Blademasters, opening them for attacks. When defeated, they flee while leaving behind their Windcleaver and [[Mighty Bananas]]. After defeating [[Master Kohga]], Yiga Blademasters will randomly appear all around [[Hyrule]] attempting to assassinate Link.\n\nDuring the [[Side Quest]], \"[[The Stolen Heirloom]]\", Link must defeat a Yiga Blademaster in order to retrieve the heirloom that grants access to the [[Lakna Rokee Shrine]].<ref>{{Cite|It turned out that the heirloom thieves who struck Impa's manor belonged to the Yiga Clan. The incident was revenge for Dorian attempting to leave the guild of assassins.
