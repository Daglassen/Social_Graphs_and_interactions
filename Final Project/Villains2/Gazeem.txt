He is a thief and murderer, enlisted by Jafar to help obtain a [[Genie's Lamp|magic lamp]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nGazeem is first seen arriving before Jafar and giving a thousand apologies to the patient one for being late.\u00a0He mentions having to slit a few throats in order to obtain the other half of the [[Golden Scarab Beetle]], but refuses to hand it over to Jafar until the latter pays the treasure he promised. [[Iago]], however, snatches the scarab for Jafar, who promises Gazeem that \"he'll get what's coming to him.\" As soon as the halves form together, the beetle glows with magic and flies off to the [[Cave of Wonders]], and Jafar and Gazeem both follow on horseback to where the Cave forms. Jafar tells him that he can have any treasure he likes but the lamp is his. Gazeem peers down its mouth, only to be knocked back, as it demands to know who woke it up. After Gazeem introduces himself, the Cave gives him and Jafar a cryptic warning: \"Only one may enter here, one who's worth lies far within\u2026a 'Diamond in the Rough'.\" Confused, Gazeem turns to Jafar (who is just as perplexed as he is), and Jafar just urges Gazeem to continue. Gazeem takes one baby step and breathes a sigh of relief, when suddenly the Cave violently shakes. Gazeem screams and turns to try to run, but the Cave slams its mouth shut on top of him, killing him instantly, and Jafar and Iago are left behind.\n\nFollowing Gazeem's demise, the Cave demands the \"Diamond in the Rough\", leading Jafar to realize that \"Gazeem was obviously less than worthy\" and that he must find this certain [[Aladdin (character)|person]] whom the Cave considers the \"Diamond in the Rough\". Neither Jafar nor Iago feels any remorse for Gazeem's death as they begin their search for the \"Diamond in the Rough\".\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n===[[Aladdin (2019 film)|''Aladdin'' (2019)]]===\nAn unnamed man playing the same role as Gazeem briefly appears during the musical number \"Arabian Nights\" where Jafar hires him to fetch him the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, but is unsuccessful where he ends up getting eaten alive, just as the Cave of Wonders tells Jafar to seek the \"Diamond in the Rough\" which is Aladdin. Unlike in the original film which is at the beginning, the man did not speak.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGazeem Close Up.jpg\nGazeem Cave of Wonders.jpg|Gazeem walking into the cave.\nAladdin-disneyscreencaps.com-534.jpg|Gazeem shortly before his demise.\nAladdin-disneyscreencaps.com-537.jpg|Gazeem's death.\nDVG Gazeem.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*His name is a reference to Cassim, the brother of the title character in\u00a0''Ali Baba'', a tale from the same collection of\u00a0''1001\u00a0Arabian Nights.''\n*He was a boss in the ''Aladdin'' Sega Genesis in the third level.\n*This character does not make an appearance in the Broadway musical production.\n*Upon first gazing upon the Cave of Wonders, Gazeem briefly utters \"By Allah...\". \"Allah\" is the Arabic term for \"God\" and the deity of the Muslim religion.\n*In a deleted scene, it is revealed that Gazeem actually retrieves the lamp from within the collapsed Cave of Wonders and uses his wishes to make himself rich and handsome, leading him to return to Agrabah under the alias of [[Prince Achmed]].\n*In the 2019 [[Aladdin (2019 film)|remake]] of Aladdin, Gazeem is forced by Jafar's guards into the Cave of Wonders for the lamp and quickly swallowed. While his name is never mentioned and uncredited, it can be assumed he was Gazeem.\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[es:Gazeem]]\n[[fr:Gazeem]]\n[[it:Gazeem]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]"
