If they do not carry any Weapons, they will swing at [[Link]]. Like other Stal enemies, their bones are very fragile and any attack Link hits them with will cause them to temporarily fall apart.<ref>{{Cite|Even the toughest Moblins become fragile when they're little more than a pile of bones, so they'll crumble after just a few attacks.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> The bones rebuild themselves without the head after a short period of time and walk toward the head as the head hops and rolls to the body so that they can rejoin.<ref>{{Cite|However, as long as a skull remains intact, they'll continue to pull themselves back together and go on fighting.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> After being broken apart, Link can pick up its [[Moblin Arm]] and use it as a Weapon. If Link destroys the head before the monster rebuilds itself, it is permanently defeated and both the body and head will vanish. When defeated, they drop [[Moblin Fang]]s and [[Moblin Horn]]s.\n\nIf Link wears the [[Moblin Mask]], [[Majora's Mask (Item)|Majora's Mask]], or possesses the [[Disguise; Bone Atk. Up]] [[Set Bonus]] by wearing the full [[Radiant Set]] or [[Phantom Ganon Set]], Stalmoblins will not attack Link unless he attacks them.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n=== {{HWAoC|-}} ===\n{{Stub}}\nStalmoblins reappear/retroactively debut in {{HWAoC}}, first appearing in [[Freeing Korok Forest]].
