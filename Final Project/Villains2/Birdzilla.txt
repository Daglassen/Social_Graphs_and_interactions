It is a parody of the movie ''[[Wikipedia:Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThe movie features a giant reptilian beast called Birdzilla destroying an unspecified city and battling other monsters, such as a giant spider-like beast with a proboscis which spits a nasty-looking substance. The four friends have somewhat different feelings regarding this film. Tigger, who was extremely excited to see it, is disappointed to see the monster is not nearly as scary as he had imagined. However, later on he is seen giving the movie some positive feedback, and even calling it \"great\". Piglet, on the other hand, is terrified of the creature, and Pooh seems more concerned about his \"Hunnycrunch bars\" than the movie itself.\n\nDuring the exhibition, Piglet gets scared and Tigger and Pooh sing the song \"[['Cause It's Make Believe]]\" to try to explain to him that none of what he sees in the big screen is really happening. As usual, the three's antics cause a lot of confusion as they invade the projection room and end up having to flee from the security guard.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* \"Birdzilla\" is also the name [[Chance]] gave to a turkey in ''[[Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey]].''\n* Birdzilla's roaring sounds are the same roars and snarls Godzilla made in Hanna-Barbera's adaptation of the franchise from 1978-1979, performed by Ted Cassidy.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBirdzilla.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Reptiles]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
