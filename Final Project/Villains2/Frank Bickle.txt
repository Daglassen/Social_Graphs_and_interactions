"[[File:Fraaaaank.JPG|thumb|250px]]\n'''Franklin \"Frank\" Albert Bickle''' is a character and antagonist in ''[[Kickin' It]]''.\n\n==History==\nHe is\u00a0a dim-witted member of the\u00a0Black Dragons. It is shown that he can break at least one board (maybe more). He lost to [[Milton]] at a tournament and got a nipple twister from him, resulting in the\u00a0[[Wasabi Warriors]] losing their second belt in disqualification. Also in the first episode, Sensei Ty told him to break Jack's leg, then got kicked out by his own sensei after doing so.\n\nFrank tends to hang around Sensei Ty due to the fact that he is the closest person to Frank's age group. He is known to not be very street smart or book smart. This shows in\u00a0Clash of the Titans\u00a0when Jack states that Frank is 19 and still in the seventh grade, which shows that he isn't all that smart. He is also known to have a little sister (Boo Gi Nights). He lives with his mother and his sister and has some pet cats.\n\nHe has a crush on [[Kim Crawford]], saying he likes how her hair smells and wanting to hug her. However in\u00a0The Wrath of Swan, he tried to sabotage her along with the rest of the Black Dragons for quitting on them and joining the \"loser\" and enemy dojo of their's. He also again tried to ask Kim to the ball in\u00a0Jack Stands Alone\u00a0to which she denied. In Win, Lose or Ty he shares a locker with Kim and acts as though they're married.\n\nFrank is known to strongly hate Jack because of karate, but is also very afraid of him throughout many episodes.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bickle, Frank}}\n[[Category:Kickin' It characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
