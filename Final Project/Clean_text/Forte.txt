connecting boiler air pump And considering Forte size this pump was most likely large boiler adjacent room below and behind the wall should much part the room than separate object Before sings his song Don Fall Love Forte was very unenthusiastic singer Forte eyes were usually black but during the climax Don Fall Love his eyes flashed bright green The concept Forte using music comfort and control his Master based all too literally the metaphorical saying music soothes the savage beast During his final performance oppose the heroes Forte claimed that never took lesson music which meant

when Forte first introduced himself Belle and Chip his lip syncing was way off Forte his human form had sharp canine teeth which gave him vampire like appearance Similarly his human form bears slight resemblance the philosopher and satirist Voltaire via the wig and facial structure Forte plan had succeeded most likely would have backfired him for the worse the commentary for the first film Don Hahn revealed that the Beast retaining the curse would have caused him devolve psychologically into literal beast with the implication that his servants including Forte would die turning into real objects result Alongside Zira and Luk Forte was the only DTV sequel Disney Villain who died This not counting Jafar who first appeared the original Aladdin film Aladdin film before dying the sequel Forte line BOLTED THE WALL has become extremely popular meme YouTube where different characters Disney not Disney demanded Forte something and refuses shouting his line Forte the only Beast castle servants who actually villain The rest the other castle servants are protagonists anti heroes with Fife and certain extent Fifi result his death Forte never returns human form ironically got what wanted after all every close shot Forte keyboard the keys not match the notes let alone the rhythm the music shot every key pressed the same time but the music shows little sign dissonance"
