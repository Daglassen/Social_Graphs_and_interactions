Just be sure you don't put your horse in a dangerous situation.|Dabi|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen {{Term|BotW|Link}} registers {{Term|BotW|Epona|link}}, Dabi starts to ask him to enter a name for his new Horse.<ref>{{Cite|OK, please enter a name for your new hors\u2014|Dabi|BotW}}</ref> Howeverm he recognizes Epona as a Horse of legend,<ref>{{Cite|...Wait a minute!
