They are the friends and henchmen of [[Ercole Visconti]] before their eventual redemption after they were fed up with his abuse.\n\n==Background==\nCiccio and Guido are two boys who hang out with [[Ercole Visconti]], constantly doing whatever they can to make him happy, whether it's feeding him sandwiches or keeping his Vespa safe.<ref>https://mamasgeeky.com/2021/04/pixar-luca-characters.html</ref>\n\n===Personalities===\nCiccio and Guido are both cooperative with Ercole. It is apparent that both of them look up to Ercole and are willing to do anything for him. However, there are moments that imply that Guido is less willing than Ciccio. Ciccio will put himself out there for Ercole, even if it means harming himself, while Guido shows some slight responsibility. When Ercole threatened to run Luca and Alberto over with his speedboat, Guido wrestled the controls from him to avoid physically harming them. By the end of the movie, they begin to see Ercole for the jerk he truly is and finally get their revenge on him for the abuse he put them through after he insults them and tells them to \"be useful for once in their pathetic lives.\"\n\n===Physical appearances===\nCiccio is chubby with fair skin, brown eyes and curly, blond hair. He wears a short-sleeved collared shirt with thick, basil green and brownish-yellow vertical stripes and a giant \"8\" on the back, maroon-colored shorts, and light brown sandals.\n\nGuido is slim with tan skin, brown eyes, and a brown combover. He wears a red-and-orange striped T-shirt, brown shorts held up with a black belt, and light blue sneakers.\n\n==Role in the film==\nCiccio and Guido are first feen following [[Ercole Visconti|Ercole]] riding on his Vespa across the town of [[Portorosso]] where as the two henchmen are seen holding a big sandwich together to which as the three stop by the restaurant Bar Giotto, [[Luca Paguro|Luca]] and [[Alberto Scorfano|Alberto]] spy on the Vespa that Ercole is riding on and after Luca fails to retrieve the ball for a local boy and it ricochets in the wrong direction, it hits Ercole's vehicle and falls on Ciccio in an attempt to protect the Vespa and upon getting it to its right position, Ercole worries to know if there is any damage to his Vespa. As Ercole asks the children to know who was lucky, they point at Luca and Alberto whom Ercole approaches them and introduces to them his fellow henchmen, Ciccio and Guido while Ercole introduces himself to the two, describing himself as the five-time winner of the Portorosso Cup. As the three teach Luca and Alberto a lesson, [[Giulia Marcovaldo|Giulia]] approaches Ercole and confronts him to leave them alone as she escorts the two to safety while evading Ercole. Upon listening to Maggiore talking to a local townsperson about the sighting of a sea monster in Portorosso, Ercole tells his fellow henchmen to get a harpoon to kill sea monsters.\n\nCiccio and Guido are later seen following Ercole to an ad promoting the Portorosso Cup where he plans to break the world record, much to Giulia's disgust as she stands up against Ercole to which after Ercole becomes insulted for being called a catfish by Luca and Giulia, Ciccio and Guido stare disgustedly at the two just before the two follow him. During a montage of Luca and Alberto's training, Ciccio and Guido are equipped with harpoons to keep a lookout for sea monsters while being led by Ercole to which while dealing with the three, Alberto suddenly gets wet but Luca manages to dry him up to avoid being recognized as a sea monster to which after tough training, the engine on Ercole's motorboat won't start as he tells the two to work together putting in their effort to get back on land.\n\nThat night when Luca and Alberto are walking across Portorosso at night while looking at a Vespa inside the Pianello store while discussing what their Vespa would be inspired what Giulia taught Luca, the two notice a harpoon tossed by Ercole as he, along with Ciccio and Guido, begin approaching him to which the three begin to bully him for hiding Alberto's true identity to which Luca grabs his harpoon and points it at its owner in dealing with the bully as the two escape from Ercole. Later when Alberto and Luca use Giulia's bike to ride downhill like they did at Isola del Mare, Ciccio and Guido, alongside Ercole, later spy on the two submerging underwater and later at the beach when Alberto is revealed to be a sea monster, the three attempt to hunt him down while being equipped with harpoons so they can kill him, due to the town's hatred against sea monsters. Alberto, however, escapes from them.\n\nCiccio and Guido later participate in the Portorosso Cup to which during a swimming competition, Ercole gives Ciccio olive oil to help him cut through the water to which the event suddenly begins. However, despite this, Giulia manages to beat the two and the other swimmers. Later, during the pasta event, Ciccio comes late while the other competitors are eating pasta. Ercole forces Guido to eat the pasta faster much to the other competitors saying that this is considered cheating, which is not allowed during the competition. During the bike competition, Ercole kicks Alberto, telling him to get out of town immediately to which upon noticing him in his sea monster form, Ercole calls in Ciccio and Guido to get their harpoons to kill him as the other townspeople fearfully react to see a sea monster in town. After Luca rescues Alberto from Ercole as the two (in their sea monster forms) continue progressing, Ciccio gives Ercole his harpoon as he plans to kill the two in their sea monster forms.\n\nAfter Luca, Alberto, and Giulia break Ercole's harpoon altogether, Ercole tells Ciccio and Guido to give him another harpoon, but they refuse to, due to Ercole's abusive actions to them. As a result, the two push him into the fountain, along with his wool sweater. They are not seen again after that.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the earliest version of the film, Ciccio was going to be another sea monster who was friends with Luca and Alberto. This changed early in development when the filmmakers realized that he detracted from the main friendship in the film.<ref>https://screenrant.com/luca-original-ending-sea-monsters-kraken-pixar-movie/</ref>\n*Guido shares his name with [[Guido|the Cars character of the same name]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFile:Ercolesandwich.png\nFile:Ercole and the Vespa.jpg\nFile:Ercole1.png\nFile:Ercole2.png\nFile:Ercolevespa3.png\nFile:Ercolevespa1.png\nFile:Ercolevespa2.png\nFile:Ercole on the pizza.jpg\nFile:Ercole9.png\nFile:Ercole10.png\nFile:Ercole16.png\nFile:Ercole17.png\nFile:Ercole19.png\nFile:Ercole21.png\nFile:Ercole22.png\nFile:Ercole23.png\nFile:Ercole24.png\nFile:Ercole25.png\nFile:Ercole - Catfish.png\nFile:Luca 37.png\nFile:Luca 57.png\n</gallery>\n===Promotional===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nLuca poster (2).jpg\nLuca poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nErcole Ciccio and Guido concept art.jpg\nLuca Character designs.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Luca}}\n[[ja:\u30c1\u30c3\u30c1\u30e7\u3068\u30b0\u30a4\u30c9]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Luca characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Italian characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
