Guardian Scouts II are enemies in Breath of the Wild.


== Characteristics ==

The Guardian Scout II is a version of the Guardian Scout that can be found within "A Minor Test of Strength" Ancient Shrines, where Link is tasked with defeating them in order to complete the shrine. They also appear in several other Shrines.
Guardian Scouts II are upgraded versions of the Guardian Scout I, with the added capability of wielding weapons. They are typically equipped with either a Guardian Sword, Guardian Shield, Guardian Spear, or Ancient Battle Axe, which they will drop when defeated.
A unique, translucent blue Guardian Scout II appears in the Ta'loh Naeg Shrine. Unlike others of its kind, this one is only defeated once Link strikes it with a Charged Attack after he is instructed to do so, regardless of how much damage it has taken prior.
