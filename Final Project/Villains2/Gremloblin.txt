He is half gremlin and half goblin, who can make people see their worst fears if they look right into his glowing eyes.\n\nAccording to [[Journal 3|the Journal]], using water against him should only be as a last resort, as water only makes him more angry. When he looks into his reflection, and thus looking into his own eyes, he sees his worst fear: becoming like his father. This causes the Gremloblin to run back to the forest in terror.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nS1e20 new Gremloblin page.png|The Gremloblin's page in ''Journal 3''.\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Goblins]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Gremlins]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]"
