Tasseren is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Tasseren is the owner of Dueling Peaks Stable, which deals in all things Horse related and also doubles as an inn. When he first sees Link, Tasseren asks if he knows about the stable system. If Link does not, Tasseren explains that the hero can board his horse companions and then summon them as he pleases from their network of stables. He tells Link that if he catches and rides a wild horse to the stable and registers it, the horse will become his companion. One person can board up to five horses and swap them in and out as they please. Tasseren will tell Link how to catch a wild horse if allowed. He advises soothing a wild horse if it starts acting up and when it settles down to bring it to him. It may take a while for wild horses to get used to being ridden until Link earns their trust and respect. If a horse disobeys his direction, Link should gently redirect it and them calm it. The horse will begin to trust and become more obedient if Link continues to interact that way. Tasseren finishes by saying that is all he can say on the subject and again welcomes Link to the stable. He says that Link can register a wild horse with them or he can head to the counter inside to stay for a rest. Once Link bids farewell, Tasseren says they will be here if he needs them.
Tasseren and his brother Rensa had both competed in the Hyrule Horse-Taming Competition as the only contestants, Tasseren winning first place.
