Empowering his body to do great feats strength and agility, as well as power and control of elements and mystical energies. He also has the ability to grow in size, up to at least over 10 feet in height and able to hold Ron in the palm of his hand. The only weakness is if the amulet is separate from Jackie, turning him back to human instantly.\n\n==Role in the series==\nJackie Oakes was a promoter for GWA, a popular traveling wrestling show. Jackie was tired of selling fights and wanted to be in one. However, with his short stature, he was denied the action and respect he wanted. He stole some ancient Egyptian artifacts from museums in towns on tour with the wrestlers, namely a talisman and the ancient papyrus that contain the spell to activate the power of the talisman to allow him to be possessed by the spirit of [[Anubis]], transforming him into the \"The Jackal\", giving him size, strength, and variety of powers that he used in the ring. But even with the power of Anubis, Jackie Oats was brought down with the combine efforts of Kim, Ron, [[Steel Toe]], Pain King, and [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]].\n\n==Trivia==\n* Jackie's transformation by possessing Anubis' spirit is based on Anubis' appearance in Egyptian mythology being a humanoid with the head of a jackal.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nJackie the Jackal Powers.jpg\nJackie_and_JACAKL.jpg|(left) Jackie Oats without the talisman, and (right) jackie transformed into The Jackal\nJackal_158.jpg\nJackal61.jpg\nJackal54.jpg\nJackal76.jpg\nJackal0.jpg\nJackie_the_Jackal_Powers.jpg\nJackie_the_Jackal.jpg\nJackal_158.jpg\nJackal76.jpg\nJackal61.jpg\nJackal54.jpg\nJackal0.jpg\nJackie_and_JACAKL.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Mythology]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Jackals]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]"
