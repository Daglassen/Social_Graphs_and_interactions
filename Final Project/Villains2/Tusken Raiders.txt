Tuskens don't like trespassers going into their territories, and are aggressive warriors. They wield primitive slug-thrower rifles and use gaderffii staffs as their primary melee weapons, increasing their lethality by dipping them in sandbat venom. Tuskens also had a unique and sacred bond with Banthas; this bond was such that when Tuskens died, their Banthas would often kill themselves out of grief. Tuskens went through rites of passage at the age of 15, when they would set out to slay a Krayt Dragon and take its dragon pearls to become an accepted member of the tribe.\n\n==Film Appearances==\n===''The Phantom Menace''===\nDuring the Pod Race on Tatooine, a group of Tusken Raiders were camped nearby the race track and started shooting at the passing pod racers.\n\n===''Attack of the Clones''===\nIn the second prequel, [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin]] learns that a group of Tusken Raiders have taken his mother hostage. He manages to find their encampment and finds Shmi tortured. When Shmi dies in his arms, Anakin takes out his grief and aggression on the Sand People - and slaughters the men, the women, and the children alike in vengeance.\n\n===''A New Hope''===\nAfter [[R2-D2]] wanders off in search of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[C-3PO]] go after him. However, they are unaware until later on that a group of Tusken Raiders are nearby. Luke and the droid investigate and when they spot them from a far distance, one jumps out of nowhere and attacks Luke and 3PO, knocking Luke out and ripping off 3PO\u2019s arm. \n\nWhen the Tusken Raiders have Luke unconscious, they rummage through his speeder, until they are scared away by a Krayt Dragon Call (their worst fear), which was actually mimicked by a hooded creature, later to be revealed as Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\n==Television Appearances==\n===''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''===\nThe Tuskin Raiders make an appearance in a retelling of ''A New Hope'' in the special, ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars]]''.\n\n===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===\nThe Tusken Raiders make a cameo appearance in \"[[Twin Suns]]\" when [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]] and [[C1-10P|Chopper]] came to Tatooine to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. They attacked Ezra and Chopper, and destroyed their ship before being killed by [[Darth Maul|Maul]].\n\n===''[[The Mandalorian]]''===\nThe Tusken Raiders appear in the fifth episode of the first season. They are not as vicious as they are in the films, and [[Din Djarin|The Mandalorian]] was able to calmly negotiate a deal with them.\n\nA full tribe of Tusken Raiders appears in the second season premiere. Here, they encounter The Mandalorian, who reveals he can speak Tusken, and his ally Cobb Vanth. After initial hostility on both ends, the pair manage to convince the Tusken Raiders to assist the residents of the town of Mos Pelgo to help them kill a Krayt dragon that was terrorizing both the Tuskens and the townspeople. Several Tuskens and banthas are killed, whether by being eaten or by being drenched in acid from the Krayt dragon\u2019s stomach. Most of them survive and witness the Mandalorian finishing the creature off. Afterwards, the Krayt dragon is gutted for meat, and an adolescent Tusken finds a pearl inside the carcass.\n\n==Printed media==\nTusken Raiders make an appearance in an issue of the Marvel Comics series ''Darth Vader'', in which Vader, on a mission to Tatooine to find information on Luke Skywalker, like he did as Anakin decades before, slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders, this time either for vengeance or out of pleasure.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', the Tuskens\u2019 rifles are incorrectly depicted as being blasters. In all other media, their rifles fire actual physical bullets.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nPerryruinsasandpeople'sbirthdayparty.png\nPhineaswithbinocularsandFerbwithsandpeoplepuppet.png\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-7207.jpg\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-7210.jpg\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-7212.jpg\nstarwars1-movie-screencaps.com-7625.jpg\nstarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-9190.jpg\nstarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-9454.jpg\nstarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-9459.jpg\nstarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-9462.jpg\nstar-wars4-movie-screencaps.com-3112.jpg\nstar-wars4-movie-screencaps.com-3243.jpg\nstar-wars4-movie-screencaps.com-3310.jpg\nTwin Suns 13.jpg\nTwin Suns 14.jpg|Tusken Raiders in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''\nThe Mandalorian - 2x01 - Chapter 9 The Marshal - Tusken Raiders and the Mandalorian.jpg|Tusken Raiders in ''[[The Mandalorian]]''\nDin is talking to the Tusken Raiders.jpg|Tusken Raiders talk to [[Din Djarin]]\nTOTR_PlaySet_ObiWan_2.jpg|Tusken Raiders in ''[[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition]]''\nFett_INFINITY_03.jpg\nFunko Pop!
