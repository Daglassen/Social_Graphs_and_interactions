She is [[Jethro Beaver]]'s sister and is voiced by Mo Collins.\n\n\n==Role in the episode==\nJolene and her brother blackmail [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] by damming up the creek. The two beavers then send a ransom note demanding the town's supply of gold, along with a pair of new toothbrushes. Peck, Toby, and Mr. Dillo eavesdrop on the beavers' scheme. They try to tiptoe away, but their cover is blown when Peck steps on a small twig. The beavers capture the eavesdroppers by gnawing down a bunch of trees and making a prison.\n\nMeanwhile, Sheriff Callie comes across the ransom note and sets out to find the culprits. She confronts the beavers and finds that her friends have been captured. Fearing for her friends' safety, Callie offers to put herself in their place. Believing that Peck, Toby, and Mr. Dillo are more likely to give up the gold, the beavers comply.\n\nKnowing why Callie did what she has done, Peck, Toby, and Mr. Dillo try to figure out how to help her. The three resort to breaking down the beaver dam to restore the creek and free the sheriff. They dive in with a splashing cannonball, and the dam comes apart, destroying the prison. Callie goes after Jolene and Jethro, and after Mr. Dillo throws Callie's magic lasso, the sheriff captures the beavers and puts them under arrest.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nJethro &amp; Jolene.png\nBeaver ransom.png\nBeaver ransom sent.png\nBeavers spot Peck.png\nBeaver chase.png\nJethro &amp; Jolene gnaw gnaw.png\nBeaver tail high five.png\nMean Jolene.png\nDon't you see Jolene and Jethro.png\nLasso jumprope.png\nJethro and Jolene all wet.png\nBuilt-in beaver paddles.png\nLog creek ride.png\nBeavers try to get away.png\nJethro and Jolene lassoed.png\nJolene and Jethro under arrest.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Beavers]]\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
