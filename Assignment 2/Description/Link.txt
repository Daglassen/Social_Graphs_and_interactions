Many of them are given titles to identify them, such as the Hero of Time in {{OoT}} and the Hero of Winds in {{TWW}}.\n\n==Biography==\n==={{TLoZ|-}}===\n[[File:TLoZ Link Blocking Artwork 2.png|left|135px]]\nIn the original {{TLoZ|-}}, Hyrule is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon\u2019s henchmen, though a young swordsman named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing Impa\u2019s plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon. Link located the eight underground labyrinths, defeats several guardian monsters, and retrieves the Triforce fragments. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, Link is able to infiltrate Ganon\u2019s hideout and defeats him with the [[Silver Arrow]]. Link picks up the Triforce of Power from Ganon\u2019s ashes and returns both pieces of the Triforce to Princess Zelda, restoring peace to Hyrule.\n\n==={{TAoL|-}}===\nIn {{TAoL|-}}, set six years after {{TLoZ|-}}, the now-sixteen-year-old Link notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand, resembling the crest of Hyrule.<ref name=\"HH 108\">{{Cite Book|quote= |book= HH |publisher= |page= 108}}</ref> He seeks out Impa, who responds by taking Link to the [[North Castle]], where a door has been magically sealed for generations. Impa places the back of Link's left hand on the door, and it opens, revealing a sleeping maiden inside. Impa tells Link that the maiden is the original Princess Zelda of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the \"Legend of Zelda\". Long ago, Zelda's brother, the [[Prince of Hyrule]], had tried to force her into telling their recently deceased father's secrets concerning the last of the three golden treasures of his kingdom,  the Triforce of Courage. Princess Zelda refused to reveal its location, and the [[Magician]], who had accompanied the prince, tried to strike her down with a spell in anger. Zelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell, but the wizard was unable to control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it. The prince, filled with remorse and unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, in the hope that she would one day be awakened. He decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy. Impa says that the mark on Link's hand means that he is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the [[Great Palace]], which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, although Link had defeated Ganon, the remnants of his army remain scattered across Hyrule. They plan to revive Ganon by killing Link and spilling his blood onto Ganon's ashes.\n\nUltimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces, defeating a strong guardian within each one to do so, and enters the Great Palace. After venturing deep inside, Link battles a flying creature known as the [[Thunderbird]], followed by his own [[Dark Link|shadow]] guarding the Triforce. After defeating them both, Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda. The three triangles unite into the collective Triforce, and Link's wish awakens Zelda.\n\n==={{ALttP|-}}===\n[[File:ALttP Link Artwork 3.png|130px|left]]\nIn {{ALttP|-}}, Link lives with his [[Link's Uncle|uncle]] in a house near Hyrule Castle. During this time, the land of Hyrule was plagued by a sudden disaster, until the wizard [[Agahnim]] appeared at the court of the [[King of Hyrule (A Link to the Past)|King of Hyrule]] and quelled the upheaval. Named chief adviser to the throne, he soon seized power from the king and kidnapped the six [[Maiden]]s, descendants of the seven Sages of long ago. The Maidens were taken to the castle tower and never seen again. One night, Link is awakened by a telepathic message from Princess Zelda, who says that she is locked in the castle dungeon. As the message closes, Link finds his uncle ready for battle, telling Link to remain in bed. After his uncle leaves, however, Link ignores his uncle's command and follows him to the dungeons under the castle. When he arrives, he finds his uncle mortally wounded. Link's uncle tells Link to rescue Princess Zelda from her prison, giving him his sword and shield. Link navigates the castle and rescues Zelda from her cell, and the two escape into a secret passage through the sewers that leads to the [[Sanctuary (A Link to the Past)|Sanctuary]], where they meet the [[Loyal Sage]]. Link is informed that Agahnim intends to open the seal to the [[Dark World]], a realm once sealed off long ago by the seven Sages when Ganon and his army of evil were banished into the Sacred Realm, which became the Dark World. The kidnapped Maidens were sent into the Dark World to open this seal, and Agahnim intended to do the same to Zelda. Link is told by the man that the only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, and the Sage tells him to seek the elder [[Sahasrahla]] to learn more.\n\nLink finds the elder near the [[Eastern Palace]]. To prove that he is worthy to wield the Master Sword, Sahasrahla sends Link to find the three [[Pendants of Virtue]], hidden in dungeons across Hyrule and guarded by mythical defenders. Sahasrahla becomes Link's mentor, offering him hints and advice at key stages of his journey. After retrieving the Pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword deep in the [[Lost Woods]]. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that [[Soldier (Enemy)|soldier]]s of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sage that Zelda has been taken back to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World which opens the seal. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but fails to kill him as Agahnim teleports Link to the Dark World as well.\n\nTo save Hyrule, Link is required to rescue the seven captive Maidens from dungeons scattered across the Dark World. Once the seven Maidens are freed, including Princess Zelda, they use their power to break the barrier around [[Ganon's Tower (A Link to the Past)|Ganon's Tower]], where Link faces Agahnim again. Link defeats him a second time, and Ganon rises from Agahnim's body and flies away. Link chases after him, finally confronting him inside the [[Pyramid of Power]] at the center of the Dark World. After a battle resulting in Ganon's demise, Link touches the Triforce and restores both the Dark World and Hyrule to their former state before Ganon intervened.\n\n==={{LA|-}}===\nIn {{LA|-}}, {{Term|LANS|Link}} is seen aboard his ship after leaving Hyrule; however, he is soon caught in a deadly thunderstorm which results in the destruction of his ship. His unconscious body is later found by {{Term|LANS|Marin|Link}} on a faraway island's shores. When he awakes, he discovers that he had miraculously been washed ashore on {{Term|LANS|Koholint Island|link}} and makes preparations to leave it by first finding his missing {{Term|LANS|Sword|link}}. A mysterious {{Term|LANS|Owl|link}} then approaches {{Term|LANS|Link}} and tells him about a sleeping being on {{Term|LANS|Koholint Island}}, the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish|link}}, and that {{Term|LANS|Link}} can only leave the {{Term|LANS|Koholint Island|display= Island}} once the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish}} has been awoken from its eternal slumber. To awaken the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish}}, {{Term|LANS|Link}} had to embark on a long journey and go through many {{Plural|LANS|Dungeon}} to retrieve the {{Plural|LANS|Instrument of the Sirens|link}}.  \n\n{{Term|LANS|Link}} is eventually instructed by the {{Term|LANS|Owl}} to go to the {{Term|LANS|Southern Face Shrine|link}} where he reads the {{Term|LANS|Writing on the Wall|link}} and discovers the startling truth about {{Term|LANS|Koholint Island}}. It is but a dream inside the mind of the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish}} which has been invaded by {{Plural|LANS|Nightmare|link}} and who is unable to awaken. If the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish}} awakes, {{Term|LANS|Koholint Island}} will disappear. {{Term|LANS|Link}} had been pulled into the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish}}'s dream world and is now the only one who can awaken it. He eventually acquires all eight {{Plural|LANS|Instrument of the Sirens}} and defeats all of the {{Plural|LANS|Nightmare}}, thus awaking the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish}}. As {{Term|LANS|Koholint Island}} fades away, {{Term|LANS|Link}} is forced out by a stream of water and awakens to find himself on a wooden board, back in the ocean. When he looks up, he sees the {{Term|LANS|Wind Fish}} flying overhead and smiles.\n\n==={{OoT|-}}===\n{{Image\n|image= Young Link Navi.png\n|type= caption\n|size= 170px\n|align= left\n|caption= Link as a child in {{OoT|-}}\n}}\nIn {{OoT|-}}, Child Link has been raised as one of the [[Kokiri]], the children of [[Kokiri Forest]]. Unlike the other Kokiri, Link does not have a [[Fairy]] companion and is thus shunned by their self-proclaimed leader, [[Mido]]. Link has a nightmare involving a princess fleeing from a man who then attacks him. The boy's life changes one day when the [[Great Deku Tree]], the forest's guardian, sends [[Navi]] the Fairy to Link with instructions to bring him immediately. A curse has been cast on the Great Deku Tree, and he asks Link to break it. While Link is successful in defeating the monsters inside the Tree, the Great Deku Tree was doomed to die before Link started.<ref>{{Cite|Though your valiant efforts to break the curse were successful, I was doomed before you started... Yes, I will pass away soon... But do not grieve for me... I have been able to tell you of these important matters... This is Hyrule's final hope...|Great Deku Tree|OoT}}</ref> He had been cursed by a man named [[Ganondorf]], as revenge for not giving him the [[Kokiri's Emerald]]. He warns Link that this evil man seeks the [[Triforce]], and fears a great calamity will befall Hyrule should he seize it. Before passing away, the Great Deku Tree directs Link to [[Hyrule Castle]] where he is to find [[Princess Zelda]].\n\n{{Image\n|image= Linkposeoot.png\n|type= caption\n|size= 180px\n|align= right\n|caption= Link as an adult in<br>{{OoT|-}}\n}}\nAt the [[Hyrule Castle]] garden, Link meets Princess Zelda. She believes that Ganondorf is seeking the Triforce. Zelda's description of Ganondorf matches that of the man who killed the Great Deku Tree, as well as the man from Link's nightmare. Zelda asks Link to obtain the three [[Spiritual Stones]] so that he can enter the [[Sacred Realm]] and claim the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it, and ultimately save Hyrule. Link collects the other two stones: the first from [[Darunia]], the leader of the [[Goron]]s, and the second from [[Princess Ruto|Ruto]], the princess of the [[Zora]]s. Link returns to Hyrule Castle, where Ganondorf is pursuing Zelda and her caretaker Impa on horseback, as in his earlier nightmare. Link attempts to stop Ganondorf, who warns him not to interfere with his plans. After Ganondorf rides off, Link retrieves the [[Ocarina of Time (Item)|Ocarina of Time]] that Zelda had left behind for him. Inside the [[Temple of Time]], Link uses the Ocarina of Time and the Spiritual Stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm. Through the door, Link finds the [[Master Sword]], a legendary sword forged to destroy evil. As he pulls the Master Sword from its pedestal, Link is sealed away, and Ganondorf appears and claims the Triforce for himself. Seven years later, an older Link is awakened as the [[Hero of Time]] by [[Rauru]], the [[Sage]] of Light.<ref>{{Cite|The Master Sword is a sacred blade which evil ones may never touch.... Only one worthy of the title of \"Hero of Time\" can pull it from  the Pedestal of Time.... However, you were too young to be the Hero of Time.... Therefore, your spirit was sealed here for seven years. And now that you are old enough, the time has come for you to awaken as the Hero of Time!|Rauru|OoT}}</ref> Rauru explains that Link's spirit was sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf, who is now the King of Evil. The seven Sages can imprison Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but five are not aware of their identities as Sages. Link is returned to the Temple of Time; there he meets the mysterious [[Sheik]], who guides him to temples under Ganondorf's control. Link defeats the evil lurking in each temple, thus awakening Saria, Darunia, Ruto, Impa and [[Nabooru]] as the Sages. Link also returns to the Kokiri Forest, where he finds that none of his friends have grown up, and most now no longer recognize him.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, have you seen your old friends? None of them recognized you with your grown-up body, did they? That's because the Kokiri never grow up! Even after seven years, they're still kids!|Deku Tree Sprout|OoT}}</ref> After awakening Saria as a Sage, Link also finds that the [[Deku Tree Sprout]] has sprouted as the successor to the Great Deku Tree. He reveals Link's hidden past and explains to him that he is not a Kokiri, but actually a [[Hylian]], orphaned in the [[Hyrulean Civil War|wars]] that raged before Hyrule was united. While in the [[Lost Woods]], [[Fado]] also references the fact that Link is not a Kokiri by asking Link if he is going to become a Stalfos.<ref>{{Cite|Except for the Kokiri, people who come into the forest end up lost. They all become Stalfos.|Fado (Ocarina of Time)|OoT3D}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Heh heh heh. Are you going to become one...too?

He was brought up as one of the Kokiri and knew no differently.<ref name=\"Kokiri\"/>\n\nAfter the five Sages awaken, Sheik reveals herself to be Princess Zelda in disguise and the seventh Sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf's heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to split into three pieces. Ganondorf acquired only the [[Triforce of Power]], while Zelda received the [[Triforce of Wisdom]] and Link the [[Triforce of Courage]]. Ganondorf then kidnaps Zelda and imprisons her in his [[Ganon's Castle|castle]]. The other six Sages help Link enter the castle, where he fights to the evil king's sanctum. There, Link frees Zelda and nearly defeats Ganondorf, but he destroys the castle in an attempt to kill Link and Zelda. After the duo escapes the collapsing castle, Ganondorf emerges from the rubble and engages Link. Using the Triforce of Power, he transforms from his human form into a boar-like monster named Ganon and immediately knocks the Master Sword from Link's hand. With Zelda's aid, Link retrieves the Master Sword and defeats Ganon. The seven Sages then seal Ganondorf into the Dark Realm. The battle now over, Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his original time to live out his childhood, at which point Navi departs. He is last seen when he encounters Princess Zelda again in the Castle Courtyard to warn her about Ganondorf and the future events that would unfold.<ref name=\"HH 110\">{{Cite Book|quote= |book= HH |publisher= |page= 110}}</ref>\n\n==={{MM|-}}===\n[[File:MM Link Razor Sword Artwork.png|left|150px]]\n{{MM|-}} occurs shortly after [[Ganondorf]]'s defeat, when Link is sent back to his childhood at the end of {{OoT|-}}, beginning a new history in which Ganondorf never rose to power. After leaving Hyrule and riding deep into a mysterious forest in search of [[Navi]],<ref name=\"HH 110\"/> he is ambushed by a [[Skull Kid]] who is possessed by {{MM|Object}}, who steals Link's horse [[Epona]] and the magical Ocarina of Time. Chasing the Skull Kid, Link falls into a crevasse and arrives in a world called [[Termina]]. He must save this land from the evil of Majora's Mask, which has drawn the moon into a decaying orbit, which will cause it to crash into Termina's capital city in three days. Link uses the [[Ocarina of Time (Item)|Ocarina of Time]] (reclaimed early on) and the [[Song of Time]], which sends him back in time when he plays it, to relive these three days again and again in order to prevent the disaster. Along the way, Link finds many magical masks of his own, a handful of which allow him to transform. Those masks can turn him into a rock-like [[Goron Link|Goron]], a petite plant-like [[Deku Link|Deku Scrub]], a graceful aquatic [[Zora Link|Zora]], or the powerful [[Fierce Deity Link]].\n\nEventually, Link succeeds in freeing the Four Giants, enigmatic deities who can halt the Moon's descent, and confronts the Skull Kid. At this point, Majora, the evil entity residing inside Majora's Mask, abandons its now useless host and retreats into the core of the Moon. Link give chase, and after a long and heated battle against the three incarnations of Majora, the entity is finally defeated and the menacing Moon disappears. Upon returning the now lifeless mask to the Happy Mask Salesman, Link leaves his new friends and continues his journey, while the people of Termina once more celebrate the dawn of a new day. It is unknown whether or not he returned to Hyrule.\n\nDuring his life after {{MM|-}}, up until and after his death, he lamented the fact that he was not remembered as a hero despite saving both Hyrule and Termina, and was unable to pass on his skills and teachings to the next generation. In order to ease his regrets and finally pass on his knowledge, he teaches the seven Hidden Skills to his descendant, the Link of {{TP|-}}.<ref name=\"HH 118\"/><ref>{{Cite|Although I accepted life as the hero, I could not convey the lessons of that life to those that came after.

Upon his arrival, he is cared for by a young girl named [[Din (Oracle)|Din]] who takes him to meet the troupe of performers that she's a part of; however, soon after, [[General Onox]] appears and captures Din, revealing that she is actually the Oracle of Seasons who was just disguising herself as a dancer. The seasons soon begin to go out of control now that Din has been kidnapped, and it is up to Link to return Holodrum back to normal. With the help of the [[Rod of Seasons]], Link acquires the eight [[Essences of Nature]] scattered all over the land in order to restore the [[Maku Tree]]'s power and enter [[Onox's Castle]]. After the young hero defeats the evil menace and rescues the Oracle of Seasons, peace returns to Holodrum and the order of nature is back to its normal state.\n\n==={{OoA|-}}===\n[[File:Oracle Series Link.png|120px|left]]\nIn {{OoA|-}}, soon after {{OoS|-}}, Link is again summoned by the Triforce to save the land of [[Labrynna]]. Upon landing, he hears a cry for help, and he soon finds that [[Impa]], Zelda's caretaker, is being surrounded by monsters. Link easily scares them off, and Impa asks that he help her search for a woman named [[Nayru (Oracle)|Nayru]]. After finding Nayru, it is revealed that [[Veran]], the Sorceress of Shadows, possessed Impa in order to manipulate Link into leading her to Nayru, who turns out to be the Oracle of Ages. Veran quickly takes over Nayru's body, which she uses to alter events in the past to ruin the future. It is Link who, with the help of the [[Harp of Ages]], travels through time in order to rescue the Oracle and restore the ages back to normal. After Link frees Nayru from Veran's possession, the Oracle of Ages teaches the young hero a [[Tune of Ages|song]] crucial to his quest in collecting the eight [[Essences of Time]] scattered over the land of Labrynna. Unfortunately, soon after, the Sorceress of Shadows possesses [[Ambi]], the queen of Labrynna in the past, and takes refuge in the [[Black Tower]]. Link, with all the Essences in hand, heads over to the sinister tower to defeat Veran once and for all. After this adventure, Link sets sail to an unknown destination aboard a ship.\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==={{FS|-}}===\n[[File:FS Green Link Bow.png|200px|right]]\nIn {{FS|-}}, when Link takes the Four Sword, he is divided into four different Links (Green, Blue, Red and Purple), each with their own style and personality. Working together, the [[Links]] must find 3 keys that lead to Princess Zelda, who was captured by [[Vaati]] the wind mage. Link travels with Princess Zelda to check on the Four Sword, a legendary blade said to seal Vaati, a powerful wind mage. As the two enter the Four Sword Sanctuary, Vaati breaks his seal, absconding with Zelda in order to make her his bride. As Link comes to, he is instructed by three Fairies to draw the Four Sword, which splits the hero into four copies of himself: one green, one red, one blue, and one purple. Together, the four Links journey across Hyrule to meet three Great Fairies, each of whom gives the Links a key necessary to enter Vaati's Palace. Inside, the four Links defeat Vaati after a fierce battle, sealing him inside the Four Sword once more.

It is the day that you become the same age as the young hero spoken of in all the legends.|Link's Grandma|TWW}}</ref> but an attack by the [[Helmaroc King]] in which his sister is kidnapped starts him on a whirlwind adventure. Link quickly sets sail and acquires the [[King of Red Lions]] in his quest to recover Aryll after she is kidnapped by the [[Helmaroc King]] and taken to the [[Forsaken Fortress]]. Instead of simply rescuing his sister, Link is drawn into a sequence of events that eventually puts the fate of all the islands of the Great Sea in his hands. Once again, [[Ganon]] has appeared with limited power. Link is pulled into the conflict between the island inhabitants and Ganondorf's increasing presence as he, with the help of the [[Wind Waker (Item)|Wind Waker]], races to recapture the ancient power of the [[Triforce]] and the [[Master Sword]] before Ganondorf's true power is realized.\n\nEventually, the King of Red Lions sees fit to grant Link the title '''Hero of Winds''' in honor of his ongoing struggle with the forces of evil.<ref>{{Cite|Surely from this moment on, you shall be known as the Hero of Winds...

However, Zelda and the other maidens are captured and imprisoned by [[Shadow Link]]. Despite the fact that it will release Vaati, Link is forced to draw the Four Sword from its pedestal in order to split himself into four and have the strength to go and rescue the maidens. The Links save all seven of them and collect the four Royal Jewels, which they use to reveal the Tower of Winds. When he followed Shadow Link down to the [[Four Sword Sanctuary]], he pulled the Four Sword splitting him into four like in the original Four Swords, but when he pulled the sword [[Vaati]] was released from the seal once again. After the Links saved Zelda and the maidens, got the four [[Royal Jewels]] from different heroes of Hyrule, and defeated Vaati, Zelda and the Links fought against the dark lord [[Ganon]] and, with the help of the Seven Maidens, seal him within the Four Sword and restored peace to Hyrule. The sword is then returned to its sanctuary and sealed there, and the Links are combined into one again. \n\nThis incarnation of Link is given the title \"'''Hero of Light''',\" due to the hero's courage and being the only one who can free Hyrule from darkness.<ref name=\"Hero of Light\"/>\n\n==={{TMC|-}}===\n{{Figurine|TMC|Ezlo and Link}}\n[[File:TMC Link Artwork.png|150px|left]]\n{{Term|TMC|Link}} is the grandson of {{Term|TMC|Smith|link}}, the blacksmith of {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Town|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|You got the {{Color|TMC Red|Smith's Sword}}!

He is fascinated by swordsmanship and horse riding.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= E |publisher= |page= 19}}</ref> His mentor, [[Rusl]], requests that Link go in his place to deliver a sword he has made for the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]]. Before Link can go on this journey, his village is attacked by [[King Bulblin]] and his band of [[Bulblin]]s, who carry off the village children. Pursuing them, Link encounters a wall of [[Twilight]] blocking the way. A [[Shadow Beast]] pulls him beyond the wall into the Twilight, where he is transformed into a [[Wolf Link|wolf]] and imprisoned in Hyrule Castle's dungeon. Link is soon freed by an imp-like [[Twili]] being named [[Midna]]. She agrees to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda in the castle tower. Zelda explains that [[Zant]], the King of Twilight, has stolen the light from three of the four [[Spirits of Light]] and conquered Hyrule. In order to save the kingdom, Link must first restore the Light Spirits by entering the Twilight-covered areas and, as a wolf, recover the Spirits' lost light. Accompanied by Midna, Link restores the light to the Light Spirit [[Faron (Spirit)|Faron]] and is returned to his Hylian form. During this time, Link also helps Midna locate the fragments of the [[Fused Shadow]], relics containing powerful dark magic. In return, she helps Link find Ordon Village's kidnapped children. Once Link has restored the Light Spirits and found all of the Fused Shadow Fragments, they are suddenly ambushed by Zant. After he relieves Midna of the Fused Shadow fragments, she ridicules him for abusing his tribe's magic, but Zant responds that his power comes from another source as he uses it to turn Link back into a wolf. He then leaves Midna to die from the world's light forced upon her, prompting Link to bring her to Zelda to help her. Link learns that he needs the Master Sword to return to human form. Zelda sacrifices herself to heal Midna with her power before vanishing mysteriously. Moved by her sacrifice, Midna agrees to help Link find the Master Sword. After finding the legendary blade, Link is cleansed of the magic that kept him in wolf form, transforming it into the [[Shadow Crystal]]. Using this crystal, Link is able to switch between both forms at will.\n\nMidna leads Link to the [[Mirror of Twilight]] located deep within the [[Gerudo Desert]], the only known gateway between the [[Twilight Realm]] and Hyrule. However, they discover that the mirror is shattered. The ghostly Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed. Assisted by an underground group called [[The Resistance]], they meet in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the mirror, defeating those they infected. Once the portal is restored, Midna is revealed to be the true ruler of the Twilight Realm, usurped by Zant when he cursed her into her current form. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that Zant's coup was made possible when he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for Zant's assistance in conquering Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows, but destroys Zant after learning that only Ganondorf's death can release her from her curse. Returning to Hyrule, Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle, with a lifeless Zelda suspended above his head. Ganondorf fights Link by possessing Zelda's body and eventually by transforming into a beast, but Link defeats him and Midna is able to resurrect Zelda. Ganondorf then revives, and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadow. However, as Hyrule Castle collapses, it is revealed that Ganondorf was victorious as he crushes Midna's helmet. Ganondorf engages Link on horseback, and, assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits, Link eventually knocks Ganondorf off his horse and they duel on foot before Link strikes down Ganondorf and plunges the Master Sword into his chest. With Ganondorf dead, the Light Spirits not only bring Midna back to life, but restore her to her true form. After bidding farewell to Link and Zelda, Midna returns home before destroying the Mirror of Twilight with a tear to maintain balance between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm. Near the end, as Hyrule Castle is rebuilt, Link leaves Ordon Village heading to parts unknown.\n\nThis incarnation of Link is given the title \"'''Hero of Twilight'''.\"<ref name=\"Hero of Twilight\"/>\n\n==={{PH|-}}===\n[[File:PH Link 01.png|150px|right]]\nLink appears yet again in his youngest form in Phantom Hourglass. The events of {{PH|-}} takes place months after Ganon's defeat at the end of {{TWW|-}}. Link is a child sailing with [[Tetra]] and her crew in search of the {{Term|PH|Ghost Ship|link}}. When they find it, Tetra jumps aboard but is kidnapped, so Link goes after her but instead falls into the sea.<ref>{{Cite|So you were following after her... And you got separated from your own ship, huh?|Ciela|PH}}</ref> Link is awakened on [[Mercay Island]] by a [[Ciela|fairy]], and they set out on a journey to find Tetra. Link and Ciela traverse the [[World of the Ocean King]], rescuing the Spirits of the Ocean King and Tetra, and forging the [[Phantom Sword]] which can slay [[Bellum]], the devil behind all this misfortune. At the end of the game, Oshus returns Link, Tetra, and [[Linebeck]] to their world, thanking them for their help.\n\n==={{ST|-}}===\n[[File:ST Link Artwork 2.png|170px|left]]\nIn {{ST|-}}, taking place many years after the Hero of Winds found the [[Hyrule|new Hyrule]], Link is a child who lives with [[Niko]] in [[Aboda Village]]. He is an apprentice of a master engineer, named [[Alfonzo]], who has helped him in order to become a [[Royal Engineer]]. When Zelda presents Link with a [[Engineer Certificate|certificate]] for this achievement,<ref>{{Cite|I hereby recognize our newest royal engineer... Link! Work hard, for we all rely on you, Link.|Princess Zelda|ST}}</ref> she also gives him a letter, telling him to meet with her, to discuss her suspicions over the mysterious [[Chancellor Cole]] as well as the disappearing {{Term|ST|Spirit Tracks (Object)|link}}. When Link sneaks Zelda out of the [[Hyrule Castle|Castle]], they meet up with Alfonzo, who escorts them to the [[Tower of Spirits]] by train. However, as the Spirit Tracks begin to fade, they crash, and are then ambushed by the chancellor, who attacks the trio. Link and his master are knocked unconscious while Zelda's spirit is separated from her body, which is seized by Cole's apprentice, [[Byrne]]. Link awakes back in [[Hyrule Castle]] to discover that Zelda is now a ghost and that Link is the only person who can see her. After visiting [[Anjean]] in the Tower of Spirits, he agrees to help her in defeating Chancellor Cole and recover her body in the process.\n\nAfter Link and Zelda travel up to the Tower of Spirits to recover a [[Rail Map]], a Phantom Knight attacks him, but Zelda charges at the Phantom just in time to take control of its body. After this, Link and Zelda begin their journey to restore the Tower of Spirits and the Spirit Tracks, traveling across the overworld using the [[Spirit Train]] that is granted to Link by [[Anjean]]. Whenever Link returns to the Spirit Tower to obtain another Rail Map, Princess Zelda possesses a Phantom's armor in order to aid the young hero. As the pair continues to travel, Link and Zelda establish a close friendship as the two get to know each other better.\n\nOnce Princess Zelda recovers her body from Malladus with the aid of Link, the two together face up against the Demon King, who has now taken over Chancellor Cole's body. Together, Link and Zelda deal the final blow on Malladus using the [[Lokomo Sword]], and shortly after, Anjean and the rest of the Lokomos depart towards the heavens. As they leave, Anjean entrusts Princess Zelda to watch over the land, asking Link to help her as well.<ref>{{Cite|Please watch over this land, my dear. And, Link... You must help her.|Anjean|ST}}</ref> Link and Zelda are then seen holding hands as they witness the departure of the Lokomos. Unlike other instances where Link departs from the land after having saved it, the young hero stays in Hyrule to fulfill Anjean's request, where he continues to be either an engineer or a warrior, depending on which Link chose. This is witnessed when Princess Zelda gets up from her seat in her office and waves out the window after having heard either a train's whistle or the clanking of swords.\n\n==={{SS|-}}===\n[[File:Link SS 3.png|right|160px]]\nIn {{SS|-}}, Link has lived his entire life on the floating island of [[Skyloft]], situated above the clouds. He is childhood friends with [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]], and they attend the [[Knight Academy]] together, where he is often bullied by rival student [[Groose]].<ref>{{Cite|You've been friends since you were kids? Big deal. It doesn't change the fact that you float through life with your head in the clouds.|Groose|SS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|He's a student at the academy, like all of us.|Zelda|SS}}</ref> Link and the other students prepare for the annual [[Wing Ceremony]], an important part of the initiation of new knights of Skyloft. After the ceremony, Link and Zelda go for a flight together on their [[Loftwing]]s, when Zelda and her Loftwing are pulled below the clouds during a sudden and unusual storm. That night, Link is visited by [[Fi]], a being sent by the goddess [[Hylia]] in order to help him search for Zelda on [[The Surface|the Surface]]. Fi leads Link to the [[Goddess Sword]], and the following day, he ventures to the Surface. On the Surface, Link meets an [[Impa|old woman]] in the [[Sealed Temple]] at the [[Sealed Grounds]]. This woman assures Link that Zelda is safe and has embarked on a quest of her own, and that he needs to continue to track her. While searching for Zelda, Link discovers that Zelda is also being followed by two other people: [[Impa]], a servant of Hylia sent to protect Zelda on her quest; and [[Ghirahim]], a self-proclaimed demon lord who claims responsibility for the storm that dragged Zelda to the Surface.\n\nEventually, Link finally catches up to Zelda with Impa at the ancient [[Temple of Time]], but their reunion is cut short when Ghirahim finds and attacks the duo. Impa holds Ghirahim at bay as Zelda grants Link the [[Goddess's Harp]]. He then holds off Ghirahim in order for Zelda and Impa to escape through the [[Gate of Time]], which Impa destroys as soon as she and Zelda are through. Back at the Sealed Temple, the old woman shows Link a similar portal that leads to the same place as the portal at the Temple of Time, and explains that Link needs to strengthen the Goddess Sword in order to use the portal. In order to strengthen the sword, Link must temper it in the [[Sacred Flames]] hidden in various places on the Surface. Before he can set out on his new quest, however, a giant beast known as [[The Imprisoned]], which was sealed in a pit outside the temple, breaks its seal and begins to climb toward the temple. With great effort, Link stops it and reseals it before it can reach the temple, and then sets out in order to find the Sacred Flames. After passing the three [[Silent Realm|trials]] of the goddess,<ref>{{Cite|This is the nature of places known as Silent Realms. They are domains of the spirit, accessible only to the goddess's chosen hero.

There can be no doubt. The sacred flames have purified this blade. Well done, Link. That sword holds tremendous power.|Impa|SS}}</ref> Link returns to the portal in the Sealed Temple. Before he can use the portal, the Imprisoned breaks its seal again. Link reseals the creature again with the aid of Groose, who had followed Link to the Surface on his second visit to the Sealed Temple. Link then enters the second Gate of Time and reunites with Zelda, who explains that Link is the goddess's chosen hero,<ref>{{Cite|You are the chosen hero, and I, Zelda... I am the goddess reborn as a mortal.|Zelda|SS}}</ref> before telling him that she, as Hylia's mortal reincarnation, must remain in a deep sleep to keep the demon king [[Demise]], the true form of the Imprisoned, sealed within his prison.<ref>{{Cite|We must stop him from freeing himself from the seal that imprisons him. At any cost... That is why I intend to remain here in this time and place... To sustain the seal as best as I can.

The little goddess is mine now! My master may have perished in this age, but in the past he lives yet! I'm taking the girl back through that gate to help me revive the demon king!|Ghirahim|SS}}</ref> Despite Link's attempts to stop him, Ghirahim sacrifices Zelda's soul to Demise, thus allowing Demise to break free of his seal. Link then challenges Demise, who is impressed with Link's courage, and thus accepts the challenge. Ultimately, Link defeats Ghirahim and Demise, and seals the remains of the demon king in the [[Master Sword]]. But before being sealed, Demise warns him that his hatred will be [[Ganon|reborn as a being]] to pursue domination of the world, as well as those with the [[Princess Zelda|blood of the goddess]] and spirit of the hero, in a cycle without end.<ref name=\"Curse\"/> Back in the present, Zelda decides to remain on the Surface, and wonders what Link plans to do.<ref>{{Cite|Look around us!

He is about to engage in battle, but [[Gulley]] comes into Link's room and wakes him up from his sleep. In the [[Blacksmith's Forge]], the [[Captain]] of the Guard comes to pick up the new sword that the [[Blacksmith (A Link Between Worlds)|Blacksmith]] forged for him. But he forgets it as he leaves, and Link is sent to return it to him. Shortly afterward, he encounters Yuga, who has transformed the Captain into a [[Painting]] on the [[Sanctuary (A Link Between Worlds)|Sanctuary]]'s wall after he tried to defend [[Seres]], the [[Priest]]'s daughter. He then traps Seres herself in a Painting. Using the [[Forgotten Sword]], Link attacks Yuga, but Yuga evades the attack by [[Wall Merge|Wall Merging]]. Link crashes into the wall and is knocked unconscious. After this, Yuga leaves with Seres' Painting in hand. Link eventually wakes up in his house and meets a mysterious person named [[Ravio]]. After telling Ravio about Yuga, Link is instructed to go see [[Princess Zelda]]. Asking if he can stay in Link's house, Ravio gives him a strange bracelet in exchange. When Link meets Zelda, she gives him the Pendant of Courage and tells him to go meet [[Sahasrahla]]. Once Link does this, he is then told to find [[Osfala]], who is in the Eastern Palace, and is a descendant of the [[Sage|Seven Sages]]. Sahasrahla worries that Yuga may go after him next. Link meets Osfala at the entrance to the Eastern Palace, but Osfala simply laughs off Link's warning about Yuga, telling the young hero that he is just as powerful as the Seven Sages were. He then leaves to confront Yuga. However, after traversing the Eastern Palace, Link runs into Yuga yet again, who turns Osfala into a Painting, just as he did Seres. Link battles Yuga, managing to best him with the help of the [[Bow]] he rented from Ravio. In a fit of rage, Yuga traps Link as a Painting and leaves. However, Link escapes with the help of [[Ravio's Bracelet]] and discovers he could now turn himself into a Painting and back at will with the bracelet. \n\nMeanwhile, having collected the Seven Sages, Yuga quickly takes over [[Hyrule Castle]]. Link meets Sahasrahla again, who instructs Link to obtain the Pendants of Courage, Wisdom, and Power. Only then will he be able to wield the [[Master Sword]] in order to access the castle. After completing this task, Link obtains the Master Sword and delves into the castle, where he finds Yuga with a Painting of Zelda. Yuga then escapes through a mysterious crack in the wall via his ability to Wall Merge. Link pursues Yuga to the other side, where Yuga has begun the process of reviving the evil Ganon, using the power of the Sages to do so. Once Ganon is resurrected, Yuga merges with him, becoming even more powerful. Link is saved by [[Princess Hilda]] and is told he is in the kingdom of [[Lorule]] - a counterpart of his own Hyrule. Link is then given a new task - to rescue and awaken the Seven Sages. Upon awakening all of the Sages, Link is granted the power of the [[Triforce|Triforce of Courage]]. After Hilda's failed attempt to steal the Triforce from him to save her kingdom, Link faces off against [[Yuga Ganon]] and defeats him. Afterwards, Link and Zelda are taken to the Lorulean version of the [[Sacred Realm]], through which they return home to their own Sacred Realm. There, they find Hyrule's Triforce and wish for the Lorulean Triforce to be restored. After the credits, Link returns the Master Sword to its pedestal.\n\n==={{TFH|-}}===\n[[File:TFH Link Green.png|right|50px]]\nIn {{TFH}}, Link passes through the kingdom of [[Hytopia]] on his travels after certain, undisclosed events.

Link learns that the kingdom's princess, [[Princess Styla|Styla]], has been cursed by a [[The Lady|witch]] to wear an irremovable, tacky outfit. Her father, [[King Tuft]], has sent an urgent request to kingdoms far and wide looking for heroes who match the description of the Tri Force Heroes, hoping that they can save his daughter and put a stop to the witch.

He is often depicted as a humble yet brave and courageous boy who steps up to the task of saving the kingdom of Hyrule (and many others),<ref name=\"Great Cataclysm\"/><ref name=\"Three Pieces\"/> a task to which he seems destined.<ref name=\"Curse\"/> As such, he is often associated with the [[Triforce of Courage]] and the goddess [[Farore (Goddess)|Farore]]: in {{TP|-}}, the Triforce of Courage activated when Link stepped into the [[Twilight]], and it protected him from becoming a lost soul, turning him into a [[Wolf Link|wolf]] instead.  He rarely shows signs of cowardice and is always willing to use his strength and valor to save and help those around him, as seen in {{TWW|-}} where he asks [[Tetra]] and her [[Tetra's Pirate Crew|pirate crew]] to allow him to go with them on their [[Tetra's Ship|ship]] in order to save his sister [[Aryll]].<ref>{{Cite|What?!? You want to come with us on our ship?|Tetra|TWW}}</ref>\n\n==Abilities==\nLink is depicted throughout the series as an impressive swordsman. He usually begins his adventure as an average boy with little to no swordsmanship skills. When trouble arises, however, Link demonstrates a natural aptitude for the ways of the sword and is able to best his enemies easily: in {{TWW|-}}, Link goes to [[Orca]] to learn how to wield a sword in order to help Tetra from the [[Forest of Fairies]].<ref>{{Cite|Oh!

However, despite this, Link is usually defenseless without a sword or an item. This is depicted in {{TWW|-}}, where Link loses his sword after being launched into the [[Forsaken Fortress]] and must use his stealth abilities to get it back: if he is spotted by an enemy, he quickly surrenders due to his inability to fight back.<ref>{{Cite|Listen up, Link...

All you have is a shield...|Tetra|TWW}}</ref> Although in some games Link is easily able to pick up large stones or push blocks many times his size, other games require him to use special bracelets or gauntlets to further increase his strength, such as the Power Bracelet or the [[Titan's Mitt]].\n\nAs seen in {{TAoL|-}}, {{ALttP|-}}, and {{OoT|-}}, Link is capable of using magic spells such as [[Din's Fire]] provided that he possesses a [[Magic Meter]], which is usually granted to him by a [[Great Fairy]]. \n\n\nLink is also talented in playing a wide variety of instruments. This is first shown in the original {{TLoZ}}, in which the young hero plays the [[Recorder]] to open up secret entrances or transport him to various parts in the overworld. Since then, Link has competently played other instruments such as the [[Ocarina]], a [[Spirit Flute|pan flute]], a [[Zora Guitar|guitar]], the [[Goron Drums|drums]], and a [[Goddess's Harp|Harp]], all of which play a major role in each of the respective games in which they appear. Not only is Link a proficient instrument player: he is also adept in using a [[Wind Waker (Item)|conductor's baton]] to conduct other players.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Main|Link/Other Appearances}}\nLink is also featured in other media, including comics and mangas based on the games, animated shows, and the {{ssb|Super Smash Bros. (series)|{{SSB|-}} series}}. Unlike the games in the main series, Link has actual dialogue in many of these appearances instead of being a silent hero. \n\nLink has also made several [[Cameos of The Legend of Zelda|cameo appearances]] in various games and other media.\n\n==Other Heroes of Hyrule==\nBesides the iterations of Link that appear in the games, the backstory to some of the games feature additional unnamed heroes of Hyrule who have a similar appearance to Link.\n\n===Goddess's Hero===\n{{Main|Hylia's Chosen Hero}}\nIn {{SS|-}}, it mentions that there was another hero a long time ago, who was [[Hylia]]'s chosen hero. It is only known that Her Grace gave the [[Sailcloth]] to her chosen hero long ago.<ref>{{Cite|You know, they say that the goddess gave the Sailcloth to her chosen hero long ago.|Zelda|SS}}</ref>\n\n===Hero from the {{Term|TMC|Minish Legend}}===\n[[File:TMC Stained Glass Sprite 2.png|right|110px]]\n{{Main|Hero of Men}}\nThe back story of {{TMC|-}}, tells of the {{Term|TMC|Minish Legend|link}}. In the {{Term|TMC|Minish Legend}}, the [[Hero of Men]], a hero clad in green clothes but lacking Link's traditional green hat, arose to fight the demons attacking the world. This {{Term|TMC|Minish Legend}} is depicted in a series of stained glass windows beneath the [[Elemental Sanctuary]]. One of the stained glass windows depicts the Hero of Men receiving the [[Picori Blade]] and the [[Light Force]] from the [[Minish]], while in the other, it shows the hero confronting the monsters that were attacking Hyrule.\n\n===Hero of the Four Sword===\n{{Main|Hero of the Four Sword}}\nThe back story of {{FS|-}} describes how prior to the events of the game, Vaati attacked Hyrule kidnapping young girls. The knights of Hyrule fought bravely against Vaati, but could not defeat him. A lone traveling boy appeared wielding the [[Four Sword]]. The boy's sword split his body into four and they defeated Vaati and sealed him away into the Four Sword.  After defeating Vaati, the boy vanished into the forest, leaving behind his sword. The people of Hyrule built the [[Four Sword Sanctuary]] protect the Four Sword and its seal on Vaati.\n\nAccording to {{HH}}, this hero is known as the Hero of the Four Sword and is not the same hero who appears in {{TMC|-}} or {{FS|-}}, but is another hero who appears in between the two games. {{HH|-}} describes him as someone about whom little is known, but he appears to be the descendant of the hero who previously defeated Vaati in {{TMC|-}}.\n\n===The Hero 10,000 Years Prior to {{BotW}}===\n[[File:BotW Wii U channel.jpg|300px|right]]\n10,000 years before the events of {{BotW}}, an incarnation of the Hero united with an incarnation of the Princess, the four [[Divine Beast]]s and numerous [[Guardian (Breath of the Wild)|Guardian]]s to seal [[Calamity Ganon]] away beneath Hyrule Castle.{{Fact}} This legend is told in the prologue and retold to Link separately by [[Impa]] and [[Kass]]. This version of the Hero is never seen directly, but appears in artistic form on an ancient tapestry design. The artwork depicts him with green eyes, fiery red hair and wearing a light blue [[Champion's Tunic]] like the one his successor wears in the distant future.\n\n{{Ambig|Start}}\n===Hero of Light===\n[[File:Hero of light.gif|right|130px]]\nIn {{AST}}, a game for the [[Satellaview]], the [[BS-X Avatar|avatar characters]] of the BS-X replace Link as the central heroes, who could be male or female depending on the player's settings, and become known as the [[Hero of Light]]. Six years after the events of {{ALttP|-}} and during Link's absence, Hyrule's long peace comes to a sudden end as Princess Zelda suffers from reoccurring dreams of evil to come. She and [[Aginah]] then witness a flash of light in the forest and upon arriving to investigate, find an unconscious youth and bring them to rest at Sahasrahla's old hideaway. Zelda senses that the youth may be endowed with the power of courage, and believes that they may be the Hero of Light. \n\nThe young hero was then given the task to locate several stone tablets and eventually learns that though Link had defeated Ganon previously in the last game, his spirit had lived on through his malice. Ganon had learned of and coveted the power of the Hero of Light, and had subsequently managed to summon the hero into Hyrule, hoping to obtain the hero's power to be fully reborn. Once Ganon was defeated, the Hero of Light returned the Master Sword they had used to its pedestal and returned to where they had come from in a flash of light.\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] has said that {{Term|Series|Link}}'s green tunic and hat were inspired by {{wp|The Walt Disney Company|Disney}}'s version of {{wp|Peter Pan}}.<ref>{{Cite person|quote= {{Exp|A l'\u00e9poque, qui disait personnage avec des oreilles pointues disait aussi Peter Pan, et comme j\u2019aime beaucoup Disney, nous avons commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 nous en inspirer.|At the time, who said a character with pointy ears said Peter Pan, and as I love Disney, we began to  get inspired.}}|name= Shigeru Miyamoto|url= https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/miyamoto-la-wii-u-et-le-secret-de-la-triforce-105550.html|title= MIYAMOTO, LA WII U ET LE SECRET DE LA TRIFORCE}}</ref>\n*In {{TAoL|-}}, {{Term|TAoL|Link}} appears to speak when he finds the {{Term|TAoL|Mirror|link}} in {{Term|TAoL|Saria Town|link}}, saying \"I found a mirror under the table.\" {{Term|TAoL|Link}} also appears to speak while inspecting the fireplace in the town of {{Term|TAoL|Kasuto|link}}, saying \"Looks like I can get in the fireplace.\" In {{BotW|-}}, he speaks when examining the cooked fish around the {{Term|BotW|Campfire|link}} in {{Term|BotW|Lurelin Village|link}}, commenting, \"These grilled fish look really good. I wonder if they were caught locally...\". This also occurs when he looks at [[Paya]]'s diary, saying, \"Must be [[Paya's Diary|Paya's diary.]] Must not look... Must not look... Must not look...\". Furthermore, in the Japanese version of {{BotW|-}}, the {{Term|BotW|Adventure Log}} is written entirely from {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s perspective.\n*In {{ALttP|-}}, {{LA|-}}, {{OoA|-}}, {{OoS|-}}, {{TMC|-}} or any other sprite-based game of the series when {{Term|Series|Link}} faces east, he swings his {{Term|Series|Sword|link}} as if he was right-handed, due to {{Term|Series|Link}}'s sprite being flipped horizontally; this also happens when {{Term|Series|Link}} performs a {{Term|Series|Spin Attack|link}} while facing east, spinning the opposite direction to what he normally would.\n*In {{ALttP|-}}, for unknown reasons, {{Term|ALttP|Link}}'s hair appears as pink; in official art for the game, it is a light brown.\n*Using the {{Term|OoT3D|Iron Boots|link}} in the pool in the {{Term|OoT3D|Lakeside Laboratory|link}} and comparing to the measuring graph, {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} stands 1.7 m (5'7\") tall as an adult in {{OoT|-}}.\n*Early screenshots of {{MM|-}} show {{Term|MM3D|Link}} with an item resembling a {{Term|MM3D|Mask|link}} of his adult face. This has led many to believe that an adult version of {{Term|MM3D|Link}} was originally planned to be in the game; however, the {{Term|MM3D|Mask}} is not present in the final version and was likely replaced by the {{Term|MM3D|Fierce Deity's Mask|link}}. Concept art for an adult {{Term|MM3D|Link}} also appears in the {{HH|-}} book, with the explanation that his inclusion may have been a prototype for the {{Term|MM3D|Fierce Deity|link}} form. {{Term|MM3D|Fierce Deity Link|link}}'s model and animations are based on {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} wielding {{Term|OoT3D|Biggoron's Sword|link}} as an adult in {{OoT|-}}.\n*Since the {{Term|TPHD|Hero's Spirit|link}} in {{TP}} is the {{Term|Series|Hero of Time|link}}, this makes {{TP|-}} the first game to feature a {{Term|Series|Link}} having proper conversations on his own as opposed to simple responses chosen by the player or utterances during gameplay, as well as having two {{Plural|Series|Link}} meet in canon content that are of different eras.<ref name=\"HH 118\"/>\n**The second instance of the latter is when {{Term|BotW|Link}} from {{BotW|-}} can summon the hero from {{TP|-}} in wolf form to aid him on his adventure.\n*The {{Plural|Series|Link}} featured in {{SS|-}} and {{BotW|-}} are the only {{Plural|Series|Link}} that are right-handed.\n**{{Term|Series|Link}} also appears as right-handed in the Wii version of {{TP|-}}, in {{OoT3D}}'s {{MQ}}, and in {{Term|TPHD|Master Mode|link}} in {{TPHD}}.\n**While the {{Term|SS|Link}} from {{SS|-}} is right-handed, his appearance in {{MK8|-}} is shown as left-handed, as he holds the {{Term|Series|Master Sword|link}} with his left hand when doing a trick. The same goes for {{BotW|-}} Link.\n*Though most characters in the series named Link are the protagonist, there are a few exceptions. Such as [[Link (Cat)|Sera's pet Cat]] from [[Twilight Princess]],  [[Link (Pig)|Abe and Rose's pet Pig]] in [[The Wind Waker]] and a [[Link (Goron)|Goron named Link]] in [[Ocarina of Time]] and [[Majora's Mask]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nAccording to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Link's name comes from the fact that, during development of {{TLoZ}}, he was the link between the past and the future, which was the original setting for the game.<ref>{{Cite person|quote= {{Exp|C'est une anecdote qui n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s connue, mais \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, quand on a commenc\u00e9 la conception de The Legend of Zelda, on s'imaginait que les fragments de la Triforce seraient en fait des puces \u00e9lectroniques !
