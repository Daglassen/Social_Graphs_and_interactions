Thadd is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Thadd is a cautious villager who guards Hateno Village's gate. Upon seeing Link, he will brandish his Farmer's Pitchfork and warily ask who he is. Realizing that Link is a Hylian, he will apologize and give him directions to Hateno Village's General Store and Inn.
If he is spoken to again, Thadd can answer a couple of questions. He will give a description of Hateno Village as a whole, though he is unable to give specifics. Thadd points out that the village is highly responsive to tourism. However, he advises Link against visiting the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab on the hill overlooking the village. 
Although Link can ask Thadd to show him the village, he will turn the hero down at once.  He will apologize afterward for his behavior, stating that although his work is important, it is not difficult. Still, he will adamantly refuse to use his time giving Link a tour, directing him to Seldon instead.
As night rolls in, Thadd continues to guard despite his sleepiness. He is at the village entrance no matter the hour, never sleeping.
