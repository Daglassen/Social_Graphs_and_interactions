Pokki is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Link can first encounter Pokki after discovering the Misae Suma Shrine in the East Barrens. Link cannot enter the Ancient Shrine because Pokki is collapsed over the pedestal where he must place his Sheikah Slate to gain entry. If Link speaks to Pokki, he will find out that she is dying of thirst and that only a drink called Noble Pursuit will save her. This gives Link the Shrine Quest, "The Perfect Drink", and he cannot enter the Shrine until he finishes the Quest. If Link speaks to Pokki after bringing ice to Furosa, he tells Pokki that there is a Noble Pursuit waiting for her in Gerudo Town. Pokki then stands up without hesitation and exclaims that she is leaving before running away toward town. After the Quest, Pokki can be found inside The Noble Canteen talking to the bartender, Furosa, about how great the taste of Noble Pursuit is.
