She is the school's cheerleading squad leader (in fact, the squad itself) who can multiply herself and make multiple clones to fight her enemies. She is also [[Royal Pain|Gwen Grayson]]'s best friend.\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Sky High]]''===\nPenny first appears as a cheerleading squad to celebrate the school's opening day and welcoming the freshmen.\n\nAfter Will becomes popular, she eventually shows her true colors being sarcastic, rude, arrogant, and mean. She then uses her clones to keep his \"Sidekick\" friends from sitting with them.\n\nDuring homecoming, she teams up with [[Royal Pain]], [[Lash (Sky High)|Lash]], [[Speed]], and [[Stitches]] to turn all participants into infants that reveals Penny and the boys were working for their master. She, along with Lash and Speed, later catch the six sidekicks in the hall, and chooses Layla as her opponent. Her ignorance of Layla's true power becomes her weakness when she punches her in the face. In anger, Layla defeats her and her clones by turning the cafeteria into a rainforest and immobilizing them. After this, Penny reveals Royal Pain's plan to sabotage Sky High and stop it from floating. However Layla and the others manage to foil her. She is later seen locked up in the detention room along with her group by Principal Powers to prevent them from escaping (since the detention room negates anyone from using his/her powers).\u00a0\n\nAt the end, it is revealed that Penny and the others are in prison.\u00a0She is seen still using her multiplication powers.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPenny's power is to replicate herself. Aside from replication, she is also very athletic, which serves as a trait in battle. She has enough power to create an entire cheerleading squad, which also works as a team.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\npenny Sky High.jpg\nCheerleader pose.png\nPenny trapping her own classmates.png\nGot them trapped boss.png\nSuckers.png\nGwen's minions ready to fight.png\nCome on sidekick You gonna fight back.png\nGwen and her gang in detetion.png\nPenny and Gwen.png\nGwen and her gang's defeat.jpg|Penny imprisoned with the rest of the gang\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sky High}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Sky High characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
