He is a karate student at [[Marco Diaz]]'s dojo, and regularly picks on him, despite being younger.\n\n==Background==\nJeremy comes from a rich family, and uses his immense wealth to buy fancy karate equipment and private lessons. Unlike Marco, Jeremy is a Tang Soo Do black belt. He is also not above cheating to get ahead in karate, as he brought a set of golden brass knuckles to a karate tournament in order to beat Marco. Unfortunately, he was found out by the Dojo Sensei, and was disqualified for cheating along with Marco.\n\nDespite the support of his parents, Jeremy appears to harbor childish resentment toward his mother.\n\n== Role in the series ==\nComing Soon!\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jeremy has a black belt in karate, outranking Marco's green belt, though it is likely he bought his way up the ranks due to his family's wealth.\n*In the show's opening sequence, Jeremy's hair is a darker shade of brown, and his headband is red instead of white.\n*Marco Diaz seems to be his arch-nemesis.\n*He is one of the few people that knows Marco has a crush on [[Jackie-Lynn Thomas|Jackie]].\n*In \"[[All Belts are Off]]\", Jeremy's final appearance.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nS1E5_Jeremy_walks_onto_the_mat.png\nS1E5_Jeremy_swung_into_trophy_shelf.png\nS1E5_I_wish_I_could_fight_you,_Mom.png\nS1E5 Sensei pretty cool right.png|\"Pretty cool, right?\"\nThe Banagic Incident.jpg\nFreeze-Day-30.png\nS2E37_Jeremy_Birnbaum_performing_a_high_kick.png|Jeremy doing a sidekick\nS2E37_Jeremy_sweeps_his_fellow_student's_leg.png|Sweeping a yellow belt\nS2E37_Jeremy_Birnbaum_in_the_spotlight.png|Fighting stance\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Birnbaum, Jeremy}}\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
