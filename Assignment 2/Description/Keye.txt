In his first dialogue with Link, he tells Link that his father forbade him to talk to strangers.\n\nAfter [[Divine Beast Vah Ruta]] has been calmed, Link can ask Keye what he's doing. Keye will respond that he's practicing his spear moves and will jab his stick towards the ground. He laments that he can't jump very high.<ref>{{Cite|But I can't even jump high enough to read Lady Mipha's {{Color|BotW Red|pedestal}}.|Keye|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hyruleans, Zora\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
