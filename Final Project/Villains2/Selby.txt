She is a criminal based in Madripoor. [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]], [[Sam Wilson|Sam]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] go to see her, to find answers on the creator of the new [[Super Soldier Serum|super soldier serum]]. She makes her only appearance in the [[Power Broker (episode)|third episode]] and is portrayed by Imelda Corcoran.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier]]''====\nAfter [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] and the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] cause commotion, in Selby's bar, ''Brass Monkey'', where she is based, she allows them to see her. They pair enter, along with [[Sam Wilson|Smiling Tiger]], and she informs him that people don't just come in and make demands. Zemo corrects her, and makes an offer. She warns him that a lot has changed since he last visited, and wonders how he escaped the German prison he was being held at. Zemo states she's probably figured out why they're here, but Selby cuts him off, and observes that Smiling Tiger is taller than she heard, and playfully purrs at him. She questions his offer, and Zemo inquires her knowledge about the [[Super Soldier Serum|super-soldier serum]], in exchange for the Winter Soldier, and the code words to control him. The offer delights Selby, and she expresses joy, at deciding not to kill him immediately. She notes they were right to come to her, and reveals that the serum is in Madripoor, recreated by [[Dr. Nagel|Dr. Wilfred Nagel]], on the Power Broker's orders, although things didn't go as planned. Zemo asks if Nagel is still in Madripoor, but Selby refuses to give an answer, without a cost. At that moment, Smiling Tiger's phone begins ringing, and she demands he answer it on speaker. As he talks to the [[Sarah Wilson|recipient]] of the call, it becomes clear, he isn't who he says he is, and when the caller refers to him as \"Sam\", she orders her men to kill them. Before they can make their moves, she is shot dead, by [[Sharon Carter]]. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Selby is portrayed by Imelda Corcoran, who also portrayed Dr. Goodman in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Falcon and The Winter Soldier characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]"
