this The Boomer stupidity and even worst stupidity boz and are cause Brady Seemengly believes him Brady shows sparkling intelligence Brady doubted him the first episode and the episode The Kings Beneath Wings Brady briefly doubted Lanny again Lannys evil nature and constantly manipulates this his own advantage also thinly hides his hatred towards the Kings with either morbid passive aggressive insults relinquishing anger punching dummies with Boomer and Boz faces stapled them Whereas Brady and Boomer are flawed rulers but care for the good Kinkow Lanny motivated purely self interest and should have become king would become tyrant amongst his people This displayed after believing the Kings dead instantly abuses his power sentencing several peasants imprisonment and even death for ridiculous reasons His sense self preservation times exceeds his need for self entitlement For example after officially becoming king Kinkow then being kidnapped Zadoc before was about

villainous schemes unknown what happened his pet fish after Season was not mentioned seen throughout Season Lannys megalomania seemed have unfettered around Season after becoming king his own personal island Lanada Instead either murdering the Kings and taking control Kinkow instead attempts drive the peasants into Lanada could rule them appears less cunning and more comedic and resorts petty theft
