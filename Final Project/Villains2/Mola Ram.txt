With two already in his possession, Ram believed all five would empower the Thuggee to destroy their\u00a0British\u00a0persecutors and establish his goddess\u00a0Kali's reign on Earth. In Pankot, he found a powerful ally in\u00a0Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister of\u00a0Pankot Palace. Ram poisoned Pankot's ruler,\u00a0Maharajah Premjit Singh\u00a0in\u00a01930\u00a0and with Lal's help, subdued the heir: Premjit's young son,\u00a0Zalim. The pair restored the palace's long-neglected\u00a0Kali temple, and set up a mining operation beneath the palace, with the intent of locating the remaining stones.\n\nAfter stealing one of the stones \u2014 known as the Shiva Linga \u2014 from the village of\u00a0Mayapore, Mola Ram's plans were thrown into disarray in\u00a01935\u00a0by the American archaeologist\u00a0[[Indiana Jones]]\u00a0and his companions\u00a0Willie Scott\u00a0and\u00a0Short Round. The trio freed the village children Ram had enslaved as miners, and stole the three stones in the high priest's possession. As the trio made their escape in a mine car, Mola Ram ordered his followers to flood the mine in hopes of drowning them, but they managed to escape.\n\nMola Ram and his followers pursued them to a narrow rope bridge, where they had the trio cornered. As one of Ram's henchmen held Willie hostage, Jones demanded she be released but Mola Ram refused, confident that he had the upper hand. Jones then threatened to drop the Sankara Stones into the river below. Ram called his bluff, declaring that the stones would be found, but Jones surprised Mola Ram by cutting the bridge, a move which sent many of the Thuggee warriors to their deaths in the\u00a0crocodile\u00a0infested waters. Mola Ram clung to the remnants of the bridge, however, and continued his battle against Jones, even going so far as throwing one of his own surviving men off the bridge in an attempt to dislodge the archaeologist. As Mola Ram and Jones struggled for control the stones, Jones' invocation of\u00a0Shiva\u00a0caused the stones to glow red hot. The move caught Ram off guard. As he tried to take one of the Sankara Stones, it burned his hand and made him lose his balance. He subsequently fell into the river and was torn to shreds by the crocodiles.\n\n===Legacy===\nFollowing Mola Ram's demise, people searched the river and found no signs of his body. Rumors began to circulate that his body had disappeared from the river and, despite statements by the British that the high priest was dead, they were unable to provide any evidence to prove it, moving to punish anyone who publicly said otherwise.\n\nMaharajah Singh also publicly declared Mola Ram deceased and offered $2,500 to anyone that could provide proof, or information on who might have taken the body.\n\nHowever, the stories circulating that Mola Ram haunted the ruins of the flooded \"Temple of Doom\" pleased both parties, as Singh and the British were keen to keep others away from the area.\n\n== Disney Parks ==\n\n=== Dok Ondar's Den of Antiquities ===\nMola Ram's headdress is an object in the collection of the alien [[Dok-Ondar]] in the Black Spire Outpost on the planet [[Batuu]].\n\n=== [[Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar]] ===\nThe three kryta dolls created in the likenesses of Indiana, Willie and Short-Round are on a shelf in [[Jock Lindsey|Jock Lindseys]]' bar.  One of the drinks is the Kali Ma-rgherita which is named for Mola's chant, \"Kali Ma\".  Mola is again indirectly referenced on a travel poster for Pankot depicting the temple of doom with the slogan, \"You'll leave your heart in beautiful Pankot\".\n\n=== [[Jungle Cruise]] ===\nMola Ram's headdress was hidden in the [[Headhunter Tribe|headhunter tribe]] during the ''Indiana Jones Summer of Hidden Mysteries'' event made to tie-in with ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' ([[2008]]).  In the backstory for this overlay, the headdress was amongst several artifacts accidentally left behind by Indy while on an adventure at some point after the events of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''.\n\n=== [[Trader Sam's|Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar]] ===\nThe kryta depicting Indiana Jones created by Mola Ram appears in this bar as part of [[Trader Sam]]'s collection.  Along with the doll is a letter from Short Round which details how Jones sent the kryta to Sam to be destroyed.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* When Mola Ram is eaten, the\u00a0Wilhelm scream\u00a0can be heard.\n* Though he is the main antagonist, he does not appear until an hour into the film.\n* In early drafts of the story, the burning Sankara Stones actually release Mola Ram from the same \"Black Sleep of the Kali Ma\" he inflicts on Jones before falling to his death, hinting that he may not have been in control of his actions. It was also intended that Mola Ram, after falling from the bridge, be killed by landing on the embankment below, followed by the crocodiles tearing apart his corpse.\n* Mola Ram is named after an\u00a018th-century Indian painter.\u00a0George Lucas\u00a0wanted Mola Ram to be terrifying, so the screenwriters\u00a0Willard Huyck\u00a0and\u00a0Gloria Katz\u00a0added elements of Aztec and Hawaiian human sacrificers, and European devil worship, to the character. To create his headdress, make-up artist\u00a0Tom Smith\u00a0based the skull on a cow (as this would be sacrilegious) with a latex shrunken head. Puri was chosen as Spielberg and Lucas did not want to cast a European actor and apply dark make-up. In the role, Puri resembles\u00a0Eduardo Ciannelli, who played the cult leader in\u00a0''Gunga Din'', an inspiration on the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7380.jpg|Mola Ram's first appearance.\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7395.jpg\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7473.jpg\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7493.jpg\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7556.jpg\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7712.jpg\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7721.jpg\nTemple-doom-movie-screencaps.com-7732.jpg|Mola Ram's evil laugh.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Indiana Jones}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Indiana Jones characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]"
