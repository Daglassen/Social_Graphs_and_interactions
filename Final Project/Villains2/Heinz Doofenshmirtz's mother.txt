If you don't go to sleep this instant Der Kinderlumper will come and Get you and put you in Gundersack|Mother Warning Heinz about the consequences of Der Kinderlumper}}\n\n'''Heinz Doofenshmirtz's mother'''\u00a0is the mother of\u00a0[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Heinz]] and [[Roger Doofenshmirtz]].\n\n==Background==\nHer early life is unknown, though she was probably born in [[Gimmelshtump]], [[Drusselstein]].\n\n==Past and Present life==\nShe was expecting her second child to be a girl and sewed dresses for several months in preparation for this, but the child turned out to be a boy (Roger). She made Heinz wear the clothes for a year because she had run out of material (\"[[Gaming the System]]\").\n\nHer \"love was always inexplicably linked to kickball,\" and Roger was an expert from the start, therefore earning her love. Heinz, however, did not share the \"feet coordination\". Instead, he was very coordinated with his hands. His mother did not care, however, so Heinz did not get to enjoy his mother's love (\"[[Thaddeus and Thor]]\").\n\nAccording to Heinz, Roger is her favorite of her two children (\"[[Tree to Get Ready]]\").\n\nShe never let Heinz swim in public pools (\"[[De Plane! De Plane!]]\").\n\nHer family was living happily, but one day their garden gnome was repossessed, so they dressed Heinz as a garden gnome and did not let Heinz do anything, not even eat or wave to the neighbor (\"[[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror]]\").\n\nInterestingly, she seems to want Roger and Heinz to spend a little more quality time with each other (\"[[She's the Mayor]]\").\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is never explained how she gave birth to Heinz Doofenshmirtz, as she was allegedly not there on the day of his birth (\"[[Raging Bully]]\").\n*She is quite strong as she can lift Roger, a fully grown man (\"[[Thaddeus and Thor]]\").\n*Heinz mentions that she currently lives in a \"singles hotel\" in Danville and owns a plasma TV (\"[[The Chronicles of Meap]]\" character commentary).\n*Her husband is alive, but it is unknown if they still live together.\n*Her first name is unknown.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror]]\"\u00a0(Flashback)\n*\"[[Gaming the System]]\" (Flashback)\n*\"[[Thaddeus and Thor]]\" (First appearance)\n*\"[[De Plane!
