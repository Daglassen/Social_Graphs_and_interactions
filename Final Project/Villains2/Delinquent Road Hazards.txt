They are a group of four cars that intentionally cause danger on the highway: Boost (purple neon/silver Nissan Silvia (S15) with a custom body kit resembling JGTC cars, voiced by [[Jonas Rivera]]), Devon \"DJ\" Montgomery Johnston III (blue customized/slammed Suzuki Sidekick/Geo Tracker three-door SUV, voiced by E.J. Holowicki), Wingo (green and purple 2004 Acura RSX, voiced by Adrian Ochoa), and Snot Rod (orange Dodge Challenger with a blower, voiced by [[Lou Romano]]).\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cars]]''===\nThe Tuner Cars catch [[Mack]] nodding off to sleep on the way to California. They amuse themselves by playing a prank on a drowsy Mack, by putting him to sleep with soothing music ({{WikipediaLink|Kenny G}}'s \"[[Wikipedia:Songbird (composition)|Songbird]]\"), and nudging him onto the rumble strips along the shoulder. The resulting vibration causes Mack's trailer door to open and a sleeping [[Lightning McQueen|McQueen]] to roll out of the trailer. When the chronically-sniffly Snot Rod sneezes, Mack is startled awake and the Tuner Cars accelerate away, leaving the still-sleeping McQueen behind out on the highway near [[Radiator Springs]], thus making the Tuner Cars mostly responsible for McQueen's disappearance.\n\nThe gang ultimately gets their comeuppance during the end credits of the movie when they make the mistake of speeding in Radiator Springs, causing them to be apprehended by the [[Sheriff (Cars)|Sheriff]] for reckless driving and destruction of property and remanded to the impound yard to do their time. It is then later revealed that [[Doc Hudson]] himself sentenced the Tuner Cars to messy roadwork of towing Bessie for their actions. It could be implied that they would be released from Radiator Springs for good behavior if they fixed the road.\n\n===Other appearances===\nThe Tuner Cars later appear in the short ''[[Tokyo Mater]]'' with the exception of Snot Rod. They did another reckless driving causing Sheriff to chase them.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Cars (video game)|Cars: The Video Game]]''===\nIn the ''Cars'' video game, two specific levels relating to the Tuner Cars are called \"'''Delinquent Road Hazards'''\" and \"'''High Speed Heist'''\".\n\nIn '''Delinquent Road Hazards''', McQueen tries to enter Tailfin Pass only to find them blocking the road. Boost tells McQueen that the road is closed but McQueen believes its okay. DJ then responds that its closed to McQueen, in which he finds out that the word meant to get lost. McQueen then challenges the tuner cars that if he wins, they let him pass.\n\n===''[[Cars 2: The Video Game]]''===\nThe Tuner Cars are downloadable playable characters.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:DJ Paint the Night.JPG|thumb|250px|DJ in Paint the Night Parade]]\nOut of the cars, only DJ appears in [[Cars Land]] at [[Disney California Adventure]], where he plays songs for the guests as part of hosting his daily dance activity, DJ's Dance n Drive. This show and DJ himself would be relocated to [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] as additional entertainment outside [[Lightning McQueen's Racing Academy]].\n\nDJ also appears in [[Paint the Night Parade]] in [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] and [[Disney California Adventure]] riding on [[Mack]]'s fold-deck spinning wild music.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nDRH.jpg\nBoostheader.jpg\nCars-disneyscreencaps.com-2384.jpg|The Delinquent Road Hazards harassing Mack\nSnot Rod in the junkyard.jpg|The Delinquent Road Hazards in the junkyard after illegal speeding in Radiator Springs.\nWingo and his minions working.jpg|The Delinquent Road Hazards pulling [[Bessie]] as pathetic, with hot tar splashed on them.\nDelinquent Road Hazards by JonnyDJ.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-04-18-11h47m56s73 774 588.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In Italy, Boost and DJ are voiced respectively by F1 racers Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli, while Wingo is dubbed by 24 Hours of Le Mans racer Emanuele Pirro.\n*Snot Rod was supposed to be in the unmade [[Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales|''Cars Toons'']] episode, ''[[Import Mater]]''. This episode was later remade into ''Tokyo Mater'', in which he didn't appear.\n**Snot Rod is the only delinquent road hazard that doesn't appear in ''[[Tokyo Mater]]''.\n**Snot Rod is the only delinquent road hazard to appear in ''[[Cars: Mater-National Championship]]''.\n**Snot Rod appears on a calendar in Andy's room in ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' as a normal car.\n*Wingo was the only Delinquent Road Hazards member that was playable in Arcade Mode in ''Cars: The Video Game'', despite Boost and DJ being playable in the High Speed Heist minigame.\n*A repainted, non-anthropomorphic version of Boost could be seen on a poster on the wall of [[Andy Davis|Andy's]] room in the trailer of ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. This poster was replaced in the final movie by a picture of [[Finn McMissile]].\n*While DJ's license plate states that his hometown is Treble Town,{{Citation needed}} he has come to visit Tokyo in ''Tokyo Mater'' depicts him as one of Tokyo's residents, making it unclear where DJ's true town of origin is.\n*If they haven't tricked Mack into falling asleep, McQueen would never end up in Radiator Springs where he would be taught humility and how friendship is more important in life than racing and winning.\n*DJ's original die-cast depicted him with blue stripes rather than green. This was corrected in [[2009]], but the incorrect striping returned on his [[2015]] re-release.\n*The song DJ plays in his introduction is \"Rollin' in the Rearview\" by Headbone and Jabu; he later plays \"Songbird\" by Kenny G to put Mack to sleep.\n\n{{Cars}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tuner Cars}}\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Cars characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
