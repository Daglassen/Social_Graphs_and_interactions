Cloyne is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Cloyne is a Hylian resident of Lurelin Village. He runs the All or Nothing Mini-Game. When Link first speaks to him, he beckons him close. He asks if he'd like to be rich without working for it. Link reacts with shock, but Cloyne assures him that what he's talking about isn't illegal.
Cloyne explains that Link can put a wager on the Treasure Chests in the shop. Then, he can open any Chest he picks and get all of the money inside. However, Cloyne reveals that only one will allow a profit. Link isn't allowed to play until he bets, and Cloyne explains the more he bets, the more he could win. He reasons that Link must have expenses, and getting some quick cash couldn't hurt.
When asking if Link wants to play, Cloyne says the only thing he could lose is his pride and his Rupees. He gives Link the option to bet 10, 50, or 100 Rupees. With a 10 Rupee bet, Cloyne states it's smart to just try it out. If Link chooses to bet 50 Rupees, Cloyne remarks that he's ready to make real money. Should he bet 100 Rupees, Cloyne congratulates him on living on the edge, stating that he reminds him of himself. After Link's bet, he sets up the Treasure Chests, telling him not to look.
Once he's done setting up, Cloyne tells Link to step up and take his chances. If Link tries to speak to him during the game, Cloyne reminds him to pay attention.
Should Link not win the game, Cloyne is unsympathetic and says he'll win next time. He asks Link if he's going to keep going or admit defeat. He's understanding when Link decides to stop, respecting that he knows when to walk away. If Link wins, Cloyne comments on his luck.
Armes, another resident of Lurelin Village, mentions that he goes to Cloyne's shop when it's raining.
