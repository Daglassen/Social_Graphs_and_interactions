Geggle is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Geggle is a Hylian worker at Tabantha Bridge Stable. Sometime prior to Link's arrival at the Stable, he and Chork went to investigate the platform at Washa's Bluff, but they couldn't figure it out.
Link can find Geggle on the cliff behind the Stable, staring up at the Gerudo Highlands. When Link first speaks to him, he asks what he needs. If Link wants to know what he's looking at, He points out a section of the cliff face that appears to be mane-made, He asks if Link can see it too, and while he would check it out if he could, he can't make it there on his own. This initiates the "Cliffside Etchings" Shrine Quest.
When spoken to again after this, Geggle recognizes Link. Once more, he points out the strange section of the cliff, claiming he would investigate if he had the energy of an adventurer.
Geggle returns to the cliff even after Link has finished the Shrine Quest, where he looks for something to pique his curiousity. However, he's disappointed when nothing happens, and he admits that he is trying to pass the time.
Throughout the night, Geggle sits inside the Stable. He wonders when he got so old, and if he was still young, he would be off exploring. He feels trapped by his age, as the only thing he can do is stare off into the distance.
