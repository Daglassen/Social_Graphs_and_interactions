She is a member of the [[Coven of the Eight]], who was cursed to live in [[Hyperion Heights (location)|Hyperion Heights]]. She debuts in the tenth episode of the seventh season, \"[[The Eighth Witch]]\".\n==History==\n===After the Fourth Curse===\nThe Hedge Witch lives in the [[Magical Forest]]. At some point, she is recruited into [[Mother Gothel|Gothel]]'s [[Coven of the Eight|coven]], along with [[Seraphina]], [[Blind Witch|Hilda the Blind Witch]], [[Drizella Tremaine]], [[Madame Leota]], and another witch. Together, their combined power allows them to perform feats of magic, any singular witch is incapable of. They become known as the \"worst of the worst\" witches.\n\nAt [[Lucy (Once Upon a Time)|Lucy]]'s birthday party, the Hedge Witch and the rest of the Coven of the Eight come to [[Tiana]]'s Palace to free Drizella from her petrified stone state she was placed in, eight years prior, before disappearing, with plans to cast the Dark Curse. The coven later capture [[Henry Mills|Henry]], who was attempting to escape the curse with Lucy, and poison him. The Hedge Witch and the rest of the Coven teleport to a mountain, where the Hedge Witch has given an ingredient for the curse. The heroes arrive and hold some of the witches with swords to their neck, only for Drizella and Gothel to reveal they have Henry as the eighth hooded figure and that the real eighth Coven member is to be Regina, who has the final ingredient. After Regina forcefully gives the final ingredient, the Hedge Witch and the rest of the Coven of the Eight are sent to [[Hyperion Heights (location)|Hyperion Heights]], with new cursed personas.\n\n===During the Fifth Curse===\nIn Hyperion Heights, the Hedge Witch now works as a doctor named '''Andrea Sage'''. She is the doctor presiding over Lucy Vidrio's case, and, after discovering the truth about Lucy's parentage, is killed by [[Jack (Into the Woods)|Hansel/Nick Branson]].\n\n==Background==\n===Powers and abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''Witchcraft:'''\u00a0As a member of a witches coven, she has the ability to cast spells and curses.\n**'''Teleportation:''' The ability to transport from one place to another.
