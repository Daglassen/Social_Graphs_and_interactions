Shaillu is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Shaillu is the manager of an Arrow shop inside the big building at the Kara Kara Bazaar. She sells every type of Arrow. Shaillu is always seen reading a book behind the shop's counter. When Link talks to her, her focus is broken from her book and she apologizes. Shaillu tells Link that if he is looking for something other than Arrows, he should look in Gerudo Town, but quickly remembers that men are not allowed there. If Link ends the conversation with Shaillu without asking for anything, she says that she is busy and asks Link to only speak to her if he needs something. If Link speaks to Shaillu while wearing the Gerudo Set, she comments that the clothes look good on him.
If Link speaks to Shaillu while searching for the man who discovered a way into Gerudo Town, he asks Shaillu if she has seen a sneaky guy around. Shaillu is unable to recall someone of that description, but does know of a Hylian girl who likes to relax on the roof.
