Cleff is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Cleff is a Zora shopkeep that runs the Coral Reef at the Marot Mart in Zora's Domain. Cleff has a serious demeanor, in contrast with his sister Tona's excitable personality. When he's first spoken to, Cleff will explain that the store sells Swift Violets, which can help one run faster. He also shares that they sell Arrows, encouraging Link to grab whatever he wants to buy.
If Link asks about the store, Cleff explains that Coral Reef is a General Store where one can buy fresh Fish. While they do sell Arrows, due to the Zora's weakness to electricity, they don't stock Shock Arrows.
When asked about business, Cleff will admit that things haven't been great. He initially tells Link that he's worried about the Coral Reef's business, since there aren't many travelers coming by to make purchases. After Divine Beast Vah Ruta has been calmed, Cleff will remark that business is improving, and he no longer believes that he will have to close his shop.
Cleff will accept Items that Link wants to sell. When Link ends their business at night, Cleff warns him to be careful going out after dark.


== Nomenclature ==
