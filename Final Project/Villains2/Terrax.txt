He has the power of the Earth. He was a Warlord before he became one of Galactus Heralds. He is the enemy of the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer.\n\n==Personality==\nTerrax seems to be very loyal to his master Galactus and will do anything to make him proud, he got jealous when Galactus chose She-Hulk to be his new herald.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nTerrax has the power of element earth strengthened by cosmic energy.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===\nTerrax was the first of the Heralds of Galactus to arrive and single-handedly took down the Avengers. The Avengers called in their allies to help fight the Heralds of Galactus as Captain America leads Iron Fist, Quake, Spider-Man, and War Machine to fight Terrax.\n\nHe was stripped off his battle axe by Spider-Man and then destroyed by Iron Fist and Captain America, and his tower was destroyed by Quake's Sonic Booms and War Machine's Missiles.\n\n===''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''===\nThe Herald of Galactus, Terrax went to Earth with the intention of summoning his master to devour the world. However, he was soon defeated by Hulk and the agents of S.M.A.S.H.\n\nDespite having apparently defeated him before he could summon Galactus, the planet eater appeared all the same, revealing his true goal. Due to his repeated failure, Terrax was sent to Earth, not to prepare it for the coming of Galactus, but to draw out the one Galactus considered fitting for a new Herald, the Hulk. The green Avenger refused, but Galactus accepted this, having found a suitable replacement in She-Hulk for not only besting Terrax, but attempting to stand up to him.\n\nLater, when the Hulks attempted to defeat Galactus, She-Hulk realised they were not going to succeed. Following Terrax out into the desert, she made a deal with the former Herald. The two would fight again, She-Hulk throwing the battle in order to make Terrax look good and convince Galactus to reinstate Terrax as his herald. In return, Terrax would not only lead Galactus away from Earth, but avoid leading him to planets inhabited by intelligent life in the future.\n\nFirelord mentions in his battle with the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. that Terrax has failed Galactus. It is implied by Firelord that he used his fire attack on Terrax.\n\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\nTerrax became a participant in the Contest of Champions a game between the Grandmaster and the Collector.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\ntumblr_mq3o68L5wN1rhgiwro1_1280.png\nTerrax.png\nTerrax_the_Tamer.png\nTerrax AEMH.png\nTerrax AEMH 3.png\nTerrax AEMH 2.png\nTerrax AEMH 1.png\nSpidy vs Terrax.png\nThe Bad Guys Won USMWW.png\nAttuma Terrax Annihilus USMWW.png\nTerrax  USMWW.png\nContest of the Champions, Part Four USMWW 1.png\nContest of the Champions, Part Four USMWW 2.png\nAttuma Terrax Annihilus USMWW 2.png\nAttuma Terrax Annihilus USMWW 1.png\nTerrax AOS 1.png\nTerrax AOS 2.png\nTerrax AOS 3.png\nTerrax AOS 4.png\nTerrax AOS.png\nTerrax USMWW 1.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
