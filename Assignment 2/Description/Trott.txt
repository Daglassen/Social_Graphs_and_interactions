It's late. We can talk later. Talk to our master Embry if you have needs, and ask the apprentice Trott if you need directions.|Myti|BotW}}</ref> Trott is a [[Horse]] enthusiast who dreams of owning his own [[Stable]].<ref name=\"Tired\">{{Cite|[You sound tired.] Is it that obvious... I'm...into horses... So I got a job with the stable association, which is great and all, but... They dispatched me here in the middle of nowhere, which I can handle... But they have me working around the clock. I feel so hazy all the time...|Trott|BotW}}</ref><ref name=\"Apprentice\">{{Cite|[You are?] I'm the stable apprentice here... I want my own stable one day, but I'm not sure I can handle working here until then...|Trott|BotW}}</ref> When Link first meets him, he can be seen pacing around the front of the Stable, having grown weary from being overworked and not eating any [[Raw Gourmet Meat]] as a consequence of the predominantly vegetarian diet that the [[Stable Association]] enforces.<ref name=\"Vegetarian\">{{Cite|[Sounds rough.] If only I could eat some meat for energy. But the stable meals are vegetarian for the most part. Ah, what I wouldn't do for some fresh-caught raw gourmet meat...|Trott|BotW}}</ref> To combat his weariness, Trott occasionally takes breaks by sneaking to the rear end of the Outskirt Stable and resting up against some wreckage. If Link speaks to him while he is resting, he will explain his situation and ask that Link keeps it a secret from [[Embry]], his boss.<ref>{{Cite|...I'm just on a little break here. Don't tell my boss.|Trott|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|[Bye.] Thanks! Don't tell anyone I'm taking a break, OK?|Trott|BotW}}</ref>\n\nBy speaking to Trott, Link can listen to his woes and desire for Raw Gourmet Meat, beginning the [[Side Quest]] \"[[A Rare Find]]\".<ref>{{Cite|Heyyyyyy... We-welcome...|Trott|BotW}}</ref><ref name=\"Tired\"/><ref name=\"Vegetarian\"/>{{Note|If Link bids farewell to Trott after remarking about his tired condition, Trott will force him to listen to his request for Raw Gourmet Meat.<ref>{{Cite|[Bye.] Ah, come on... You have time for this, don't you? Things have been pretty rough out here. If only I could eat some meat for energy. But the stable meals are vegetarian for the most part. Ah, what I wouldn't do for some fresh-caught raw gourmet meat...|Trott|BotW}}</ref>}} If Link returns with Raw Meat or Raw Prime, Trott will recognize its scent and inform him that he will accept nothing less than Raw Gourmet Meat.<ref>{{Cite|Ahh...what I wouldn't do for some fresh-caught raw gourmet meat... Oh... That aroma... You definitely have meat on you, but I'm really craving raw gourmet meat, not regular or even prime meat. And it's gotta be raw! I'm kind of a weird meat snob like that... Anything...else?|Trott|BotW}}</ref> If Link has [[Seared Gourmet Meat]], Trott will smell the aroma of the Gourmet Meat but complain that the Meat is cooked as he prefers his Meat raw and full of juice.<ref>{{Cite|Heyyyyyyyy... We-welcome... Ahh...what I wouldn't do for some fresh-caught raw gourmet meat... Oh... That aroma... It has that tinge of raw gourmet meat, but...cooked? Aww, man. I like my raw gourmet meat rare and juicy!|Trott|BotW}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning with Raw Gourmet Meat, Trott will grow excited over its scent and offer to pay Link for sharing it with him.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! That meaty aroma! You don't happen to have any raw gourmet meat on you, do you? I'm no freeloader, of course. I'll pay you well if you split it with me.|Trott|BotW}}</ref>{{Note|If Link lies to Trott and says that he has no Meat, Trott will dejectedly say that his cravings have caused him to hallucinate the smell of Meat.<ref>{{Cite|[No meat here.] Ahh... I want to eat meat so bad I'm starting to hallucinate smells...|Trott|BotW}}</ref>}} If Link agrees, Trott will give him a [[Silver Rupee]] in return and resolve to work hard now that his craving for Meat has been sated.<ref>{{Cite|[Sure thing.] For real?! Well, you don't have to tell me twice! I'll take one! Does {{Color|BotW Red|100 rupees}} work for you?|Trott|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Trott, a stable hand at the Outskirt Stable, found color returning to his cheeks for the first time in a while after a meaty dinner. From now on, he'll pay you {{Color|BotW Red|100 rupees}} out of his own pocket each time you bring him some raw gourmet meat.|N/A|BotW}}</ref> Trott also offers to pay Link for any more Raw Gourmet Meat that he has on hand.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks to you, I'm starting to feel better about this job. I'm going to really work my hardest. If you get ahold of any more raw gourmet meat, hook me up!|Trott|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter completing \"A Rare Find\", Trott's mood improves dramatically. He can be seen walking around and occasionally greeting and waving to guests.<ref>{{Cite|Welcome!|Trott|BotW}}</ref> As Trott promised, he will still purchase Raw Gourmet Meat from Link for a Silver Rupee apiece.<ref>{{Cite|[Have some meat!] Thanks! Is {{Color|BotW Red|100 rupees}} still good?|Trott|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|[Sure.] Thanks to you, I'm feeling better. If you get ahold of more raw gourmet meat, come see me|Trott|BotW}}</ref>{{Note|Trott's hopes will be crushed if Link changes his mind after originally offering to sell him some meat.<ref>{{Cite|[Eh, never mind.] No... Really?|Trott|BotW}}</ref>}} However, Trott will only accept three pieces of Raw Gourmet Meat per day and will tell Link to return tomorrow if offered any more.<ref>{{Cite|This is more than enough for today. If you get ahold of more raw gourmet meat, come see me tomorrow.|Trott|BotW}}</ref> If Link attempts to give Trott Seared Gourmet Meat, he will complain about how its value has diminished and refuse to buy it from him.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks! ...But you went and cooked your raw gourmet meat! That's criminal, man. The only way to eat raw gourmet meat...is raw! Get that cooked stuff out of my face.|Trott|BotW}}</ref> Additionally, if Link offers Meat to Trott without having any Raw Gourmet Meat in his [[Inventory]], Trott will get upset and tell him to return when he actually has something to offer.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks! Hey, wait a tick... You don't have any raw gourmet meat! You got my hopes up for nothing... Not cool, man. Talk to me when you actually have some raw gourmet meat.|Trott|BotW}}</ref> Trott will not react to [[Icy Gourmet Meat]].\n\nIf Link speaks to Trott before giving him any Raw Gourmet Meat, he can ask Trott who he is to learn of his aspirations to own a Stable of his own.<ref name=\"Apprentice\">{{Cite|[You are?] I'm the stable apprentice here... I want my own stable one day, but I'm not sure I can handle working here until then...|Trott|BotW}}</ref> Link can also inquire about Raw Gourmet Meat to learn that migrations occasionally take place atop [[Satori Mountain]], providing the perfect opportunity to hunt for Meat.<ref>{{Cite|[Raw gourmet meat?] Are you into it too? The stuff next to the bone is the BEST! If only I could take a break and go to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Satori Mountain}} area just in front of Hyrule Ridge to go hunting... Usually there aren't a lot of animals out there, but every so often a migration hits and it's {{Color|BotW Red|teeming with animal life}}. But I'm never off the clock, so I can't go myself...|Trott|BotW}}</ref> At any point, Link can ask Trott for information about the Outskirt Stable and its direct surroundings.<ref>{{Cite|[This place?] This is the {{Color|BotW Blue|Outskirt Stable}}. As you can see, we're out in the boonies... {{Color|BotW Blue|Hyrule Ridge}} is north of here. That's the quickest way to get to Rito Village. {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Desert}} is southwest of here, but there are some really nasty monsters on the way...|Trott|BotW}}</ref>{{Note|If Link asks after giving Trott some Raw Gourmet Meat, Trott will add that Link should be careful on the way to Gerudo Desert because of the amount of monsters.<ref>{{Cite|[This place?] This is the {{Color|BotW Blue|Outskirt Stable}}. As you can see, we're way out in the boonies. North of here is {{Color|BotW Blue|Hyrule Ridge}}. That's the best way to get to Rito Village. {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Desert}} is to the southwest, but there are a bunch of monsters out there, so be careful.|Trott|BotW}}</ref>}} After completing \"A Rare Find\", Trott can also tell Link about ideal hunting areas, citing Satori Mountain and the [[Lord of the Mountain]] who makes its home there. Following this, Trott begins to wonder what the flavor of its meat is like.<ref>{{Cite|[Hunting area?] There's this area just in front of Hyrule Ridge near {{Color|BotW Blue|Satori Mountain}} that's {{Color|BotW Red|teeming with animal life}} every so often. I hear the Lord of the Mountain makes its home around there. I wonder what its meat tastes like...|Trott|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Names\n|align= left\n|enBr= \n|enBrM= \n|ja= {{Romanize|\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8|Torotto}}\n|jaM= \n|zhS= \n|zhSM= \n|zhT= \n|zhTM= \n|nl= Trott\n|nlM= \n|fi= \n|fiM= \n|frC= \n|frCM= \n|frF= Trott\n|frFM= \n|de= {{De|Trond}}\n|deM= \n|hu= \n|huM= \n|it= Trott\n|itM= \n|ko= {{Romanize|\ud2b8\ub987|Teuleus}}\n|koM= \n|no= \n|noM= \n|pl= \n|plM= \n|ptB= \n|ptBM= \n|ptP= \n|ptPM= \n|ru= {{Romanize|\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0442|Trott}}\n|ruM= \n|esS= Trott\n|esSM= \n|esL= \n|esLM= }}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[A Rare Find]]\n\n{{Notes}}\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
