This version is the result of [[Morgan le Fay]] magically placing a jack-o'-lantern on the head of a security guard in her plans to bring about the end of the world, transforming him into a humanoid flaming pumpkin man. Jack O'Lantern attacks [[Spider-Man]], [[Jessie Prescott]], and the Ross Kids in the space exhibit. While Spider-Man handles Jack O'Lantern, Jessie and the Ross Kids hide out during the battle. After Morgan le Fay is defeated, Jack O'Lantern regresses back to the security guard.\n\n===''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''===\nJack O'Lantern appears in the four-part special \"Bring on the Bad Guys\", where he is one of the bounty hunters who was hired by the Chameleon to hunt down Spider-Man. He battles the web-slinger on the Brooklyn Bridge while Spider-Man was saving a bus of people from falling. Spider-Man follows him into a warehouse Jack concocts his weapons in. While looking for Spider-Man in the warehouse, Jack slips about the bounty placed on Spider-Man though he refuses to directly tell Spider-Man who his benefactor is. Seeing that he won't get more answers from the villain, Spider-Man then kicks Jack into a vat of caramel, encasing him for the police to arrive and arrest him.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition]]''===\nJack O'Lantern's Glider is a Power Disc in the game, The glider is a unique case in that it both a Pack and an air Vehicle at the same time.
