"\n[[File:Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit_figures.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Voltaire as shown at the far left from ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' figures.]]'''Voltaire''' is a scrapped character from the live-action and animation hybrid film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nVoltaire was originally [[Judge Doom]]'s pet vulture. The reason why he was cut out in the final film release is the interest of finishing the film on schedule and budget cuts. Despite his deletion, Voltaire still appears with the original Judge Doom action figure. He also appears in the NES game.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Voltaire is named after one of the French Enlightenment philosophers and a founding father of the ideas behind the French Revolution.\n* His design was based on one of the [[Vultures (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs)|vultures]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.\n* When he was removed from the film, the [[Toon Patrol]] became more major characters and filled in for several roles that Voltaire originally would've done. For instance, Greasy ended up dropping bricks on Roger Rabbit, and Smarty ended up getting dipped.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit figure back view.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
