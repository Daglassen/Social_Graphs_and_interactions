He is played by Chris Sullivan.\n\n==Background==\nTaserface is an advance scout for the [[Kree]], who resigned from his position and took leadership of [[Ravagers|the Ravagers]] away from [[Yondu Udonta|Yondu]]. His name is a cheeky reference to his cybernetic implants, which give him superhuman strength, superhuman speed, invulnerability, and the ability to shoots energy blasts from his arms.\n\n===Personality===\nTaserface is brutal, primitive, and aggressive, ideal traits to lead the Ravagers. He is also sadistic, reveling in the pain of Baby Groot, but his largest pet peeve is hearing other characters insult his name, which he believes is cool.\n\n==History==\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTaserface BTS.jpg\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 86.jpg\ntaserface_1024x1024.png\nWhat If...? - 1x02 - What If...
