This house isn't looking any less demolished despite all the effort... [Who are you?] I just started at Bolson Construction. Name is Karson!|Karson|BotW}}</ref> He can initially be found attempting to demolish [[Link's House]] in [[Hateno Village]].<ref>{{Cite|Mornin' there! Another day, another rupee! [What are you doing?] Workin', as you can see! This old house has been abandoned. Everyone in Hateno Village agreed we should demolish it.|Karson|BotW}}</ref> He tells [[Link]] that the former owner of the house left to serve at [[Hyrule Castle]] and never returned,<ref>{{Cite|The old owner apparently went off to {{Color|BotW Blue|the castle}} to report for service. Never came back, never wrote, so away it goes! [Hard work, huh?] Yep! And I wouldn't want it any other way, to be honest with ya.|Karson|BotW}}</ref> so he is carrying out the Village's collective decision to clear the land for development. If Link offers to buy the house, Karson will direct him to his boss, [[Bolson]].<ref>{{Cite|[I'd buy this place!] Well, I'm not into real estate, so I can't really help you out there. If you're really interested in this place, you're gonna need to talk to the {{Color|BotW Blue|boss}}.|Karson|BotW}}</ref>\n\nKarson will admit to Link that he was hired by Bolson Construction thanks to his name ending in \"-son,\" a requirement for all employees of the company.<ref>{{Cite|My trial period is done, and they finally hired me as an official member of the Bolson family! I'm so glad my name happens to end in \"son,\" y'know? [...Son?] Yep, you heard me right! Apparently, {{Color|BotW Red|your name}} has to end in \"{{Color|BotW Red|son}}\" to work at Bolson Construction.|Karson|BotW}}</ref> This inadvertently provides a hint for the [[Side Quest]] \"[[From the Ground Up]]\", a Quest to build the population of [[Tarrey Town]] in [[Akkala]].<ref>{{Cite|The boss there was saying he's really looking into expanding the business. But I'm wondering\u2014just how many folks are out there with {{Color|BotW Red|names ending in}} \"{{Color|BotW Red|son}}\"? Maybe lots?|Karson|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link offers to buy the house from Bolson, Karson will cease work on the house and sit underneath a tree nearby, awaiting Bolson's orders.<ref>{{Cite|I got the order to stop from the boss, so demolition is on hold for now... [That's great.] Hoo...it sure is.|Karson|BotW}}</ref> There, he will admit to Link that he finds his construction work to be hard and he idolizes Hudson's ability to work quickly.<ref>{{Cite|Demolition is seriously hard work. But there are folks like Hudson who could bust through a house in one day... The guy's my hero.|Karson|BotW}}</ref> He also expresses surprise at Link's initiative to purchase a house at his age.<ref>{{Cite|So... I overheard you talking to the boss. Are you really gonna buy the house? [Yep, buyin' it!] {{Big|Whoa! No way!}} That's incredible. And you even look younger than me... Not that it matters. We all have our own place to build. I'll just keep workin' hard the best way I know how!|Karson|BotW}}</ref> Upon the complete purchase of the house, Karson will begin to renovate the house alongside Bolson for a fee of 100 [[Rupee]]s per addition.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*If Link speaks to Karson while not wearing a [[Armor|shirt]], he will comment on Link's \"free\"-ness.<ref>{{Cite|Lookin' mighty free there, eh?|Karson|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe first half of Karson's name is a variation of the Scandinavian name Karr, which means \"reluctant\", \"curly haired\", and \"obstinate\". <ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.behindthename.com/name/ka10rr/submitted |site= behindthename.com |title= Given Name KARR}}</ref> \n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW_Karson_Concept_Artwork.png|Concept artwork of \n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n\n*[[Hylian Homeowner]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
