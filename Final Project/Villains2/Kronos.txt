Kronos is king of the [[Titans]]. He was first mentioned in the ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]'' animated series episode \"[[Hercules and the Drama Festival]]\". It is implied that Kronos favored [[Hades]]. It is also implied that Kronos is the reason why Hades is evil.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to [[Pain and Panic]], Kronos preceded his son [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] as ruler of the gods. After he found out one of his newborn children would overthrow him, he began swallowing them one by one \u2015 except for Zeus, who managed to escape thanks to his mother who instead tricked Kronos into eating a rock thinking it was Zeus. Later, Zeus returned and freed his brothers from his father's stomach, along with the rock Kronos swallowed. As an act of revenge, Kronos put a curse on the rock so that any God that comes near it will be placed in eternal sleep. He was then imprisoned in an unknown region of [[Tartarus]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''===\nThroughout the series, only minor mentions of him are made. In \"[[Hercules and the Visit from Zeus]]\", he is briefly mentioned when Hermes illustrates a difference on the relationship between fathers and their sons, comparing Hercules' relationship to Zeus, and Zeus' relationship to his own father. Zeus replies, \"That was different! He tried to swallow me whole!\"\n\nIn \"Hercules and the Drama Festival\", [[Pain and Panic]] reveal the Kronos Stone to [[Hades]] while singing the story of Kronos to him. They then tell him that he can use it to overthrow Zeus.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nKronos is only mentioned in the Underworld Storybook. He is also completely rewritten from the villainous Titan that ate his children, defeated by Zeus, and banished to Tartarus. Instead, he appears to be a loving father to both Zeus and Hades, and who was killed by the jealous latter.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being a minor Disney villain, Kronos is one of the few that has a song sung about them. The song in question is appropriately titled \"[[Kronos Stone]]\", and is sung by Pain and Panic.\n*The Romans adopted\u00a0'''Cronus'''\u00a0as the god\u00a0'''Saturn'''.\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Titans]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
