He was featured prominently in the episode featuring guest star Cindy Crawford, in which Bobo fell in love with Crawford and made a number of clumsy attempts to woo her.\nErnst Stavros Grouper insisted that Bobo changes his name to \"Whitley Nibbles the Television Elf.\" In another episode, Bobo claimed his name was \"Bizzo the Bat,\" in order to scam [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] out of food.\n\nBobo later appeared on ''Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony'' at movies.com, where he was seen auditioning for ''Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith''. Bobo performed parodies of [[Star Wars]] characters such as [[Yoda]]: \"'Careful you must be when sensing the future!' Geez, what is this guy, dyslexic or something?\"\n\nHe also appeared in \"The Muppets on Muppets,\" a bonus feature on ''The Muppet Show: Season Two''. Where he says his favorite place to visit is [[New Zealand]].\n\nOther appearances include portraying an airport security guard in ''[[A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa]]'' (working alongside [[Frank Meany]]), being one of the Wicked Witch's henchmen in ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', and starring in a series of videos on [[Disney Xtreme Digital]] called \"Better Living with Bobo,\" where he is paired with [[w:c:muppets:Beauregard|Beauregard]].\n\nIn ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'', Bobo serves a similar function to his appearances in ''Muppets from Space'' and ''Letters to Santa'', as the well-meaning, suit-clad assistant to the antagonist. In this case, Bobo is the \"less-helpful-than-you-might-wish assistant\" to [[Tex Richman]], with Bobo and [[Uncle Deadly]] apparently having gone to work for Richman after the Muppets broke up in the early 2000s.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Bobo puppet originally debuted as one of the bears that hibernated with [[Fozzie Bear]] in ''[[w:c:muppet:The Muppets Take Manhattan|The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' (where he was performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]). The puppet was slightly altered when it was used as Bobo. Also prior to becoming Bobo, the bear puppet would also be used in a promotional photo for the unproduced series ''W.I.L.D.'', as well as ''[[w:c:muppets:Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree|Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree]]'', and in one of the Muppet Time recurring sketches, Frog Scouts, as a customer who buys all the cookies from them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n830px-TheMuppets-(2011)-Finale-Bobo&Showgirls.jpg\nCindy Crawford Bobo.jpg|Bobo with Cindy Crawford\nGreentrailerbobodeadlycooperstatlerwaldorf.jpg\nJay leno.jpg|Bobo with [[Jay Leno]]\nKevin eubanks.jpg|Bobo with Jay Leno and Kevin Eubanks\nBobo KMUP security Prince.jpg\nQvc rick bobo 3.jpg\nQvc rick bobo 1.jpg\nQvc bobo rat.jpg\nQvc bobo rizzo stockroom.jpg\nKristen Bell and Bobo.jpg|Bobo with [[Kristen Bell]]\nToday Bobo Lawyer.jpg\nLost-slapdown1.jpg\nBohemianbobo.jpg\nEpisode 101 (23).jpeg\nEpisode 104 (21).jpeg\nEpisode 104 (15).jpeg\nTheMuppets-S01E08-SweetumsCueCards.png\nTheMuppets-S01E08-Fozzie'sFanFun.png\nTheMuppets-S01E08-BearHug.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n[[nl:Bobo the Bear]]\n[[pt-br:Bobo, o Urso]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:The Muppets characters]]\n[[Category:Muppets Most Wanted characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
