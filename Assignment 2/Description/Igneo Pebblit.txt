They are fairly easy to spot at night, as they glow brightly, seemingly from the veins of lava that run through their bodies. {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} will be burned if he comes into contact with one unprotected.\n\nThe main attack of Igneo Pebblits is moving toward Link and swiping at him with an arm. They can be defeated by throwing [[Remote Bomb]]s, cooling them off with a cold-based weapon such as [[Ice Arrow]]s to allow them to be safely touched, or wearing a full set of [[Flamebreaker Armor]] that has been enhanced twice by a [[Great Fairy]] for the [[Fireproof]] [[Set Bonus]]. Igneo Pebblits explode if Link holds them for too long or if they're thrown.\n\nOnce killed, each one will drop a single piece of [[Flint]], {{Term|BotW|Amber|link}}, or {{Term|BotW|Amber|link}}.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Stub|HWAoC}}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Frost Pebblit]]\n* [[Igneo Talus]]\n* [[Stone Pebblit]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Fire-Related Enemies, Taluses\n |enemies= BotW, HWAoC\n}}"
