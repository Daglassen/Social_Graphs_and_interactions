The {{Term|ALttP|Magic Cape}} is necessary to obtain the {{Term|ALttP|Cane of Byrna|link}}, as it is preceded by a number of {{Plural|ALttP|Floor Spikes}} that {{Term|ALttP|Link}} would be unable to traverse safely otherwise.\n\n==={{LA|-}}===\n{{Stub|LA}}\n\n==={{OoT|-}}===\nMany {{Plural|OoT3D|Floor Spikes}} are found inside the {{Term|OoT3D|Water Temple|link}} in {{OoT}}, typically blocking passage until the water level rises. In the {{Term|OoT3D|Shadow Temple|link}}, certain {{Plural|OoT3D|Floor Spikes}} are invisible, requiring that {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} use the {{Term|OoT3D|Lens of Truth|link}} in order to see them. The {{Term|OoT3D|Hover Boots|link}} can also be used to walk above {{Plural|OoT3D|Floor Spikes}}, momentarily avoiding damage, while the {{Term|OoT3D|Goron Tunic|link}} causes {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} to take damage less frequently from them.\n\n==={{OoS|-}}===\nIn {{OoS}}, in order to defeat {{Term|OoS|Dodongo|link}}, the {{Term|OoS|Boss|link}} from the {{Term|OoS|Snake's Remains|link}}, {{Term|OoS|Link|link}} must toss it onto the {{Plural|OoS|Floor Spikes}} found in the center of the room after stunning it with a {{Term|OoS|Bomb|link}}.\n\n==={{OoA|-}}===\n{{Stub|OoA}}\n\n==={{TWW|-}}===\n{{Plural|TWWHD|Floor Spikes}} appear in the {{Term|TWWHD|Forsaken Fortress|link}} and the {{Term|TWWHD|Wind Temple|link}} in {{TWW}}, though in the former they are unable to damage {{Term|TWWHD|Link|link}} and serve only to obstruct his path. In both {{Plural|TWWHD|Dungeon|link}}, the {{Plural|TWWHD|Floor Spikes}} can usually be retracted once a certain puzzle is solved or all enemies in the area have been defeated.\n\n==={{FSA|-}}===\n{{Stub|FSA}}\n\n==={{TMC|-}}===\n{{Plural|TMC|Floor Spikes}} appear in {{Plural|TMC|Dungeon|link}} and other {{Plural|TMC|Cave|link}} across {{Term|TMC|Hyrule|link}} in {{TMC}}, both while {{Term|TMC|Link}} is regular-sized and {{Term|TMC|Minish|link}}-sized. They will damage {{Term|TMC|Link|link}} if he touches them, though they can be leapt over by using {{Term|TMC|Roc's Cape|link}}.\n\n==={{TP|-}}===\n{{Plural|TPHD|Floor Spikes}} appear within the {{Term|TPHD|Arbiter's Grounds (Dungeon)|link}} in {{TP}}, where they emerge from holes in the floor when {{Term|TPHD|Link}} approaches. Several of their locations are also concealed by {{Term|TPHD|Quicksand|link}}, making it difficult to judge their position and maneuver around them. When they are above the ground, however, {{Term|TPHD|Link}} is able to destroy them permanently using {{Plural|TPHD|Bomb}}.\n\n==={{PH|-}}===\n{{Plural|PH|Floor Spikes}} appear inside {{Plural|PH|Dungeon|link}} in {{PH}}, where they serve to impede {{Term|PH|Link|link}}'s progress and will damage him on contact. {{Term|PH|Link}} can usually deactivate them by defeating enemies and solving puzzles. {{Plural|PH|Phantom|link}} are able to move over {{Plural|PH|Floor Spikes}} without taking damage. Some {{Plural|PH|Floor Spikes}} move up and down intermittently, forcing {{Term|PH|Link}} to pass over them quickly while they are briefly inactive.\n\n==={{ST|-}}===\n{{Plural|ST|Floor Spikes}} appear inside {{Plural|ST|Dungeon|link}} in {{ST}}, where they serve to impede {{Term|ST|Link|link}}'s progress and will damage him on contact. {{Term|ST|Link}} can usually deactivate them by defeating enemies and solving puzzles. As {{Plural|ST|Phantom|link}} are unaffected by {{Plural|ST|Floor Spikes}}, {{Term|ST|Princess Zelda|link}} can also harness this immunity when she gains the ability to possess {{Plural|ST|Phantom}}, and use it to cross over the {{Plural|ST|Floor Spikes}} and help solve puzzles normally out of {{Term|ST|Link}}'s reach.\n\n==={{SS|-}}===\n{{Plural|SS|Floor Spikes}} appear within a single room inside the {{Term|SS|Lanayru Mining Facility|link}} in {{SS}}, where they are stealthily concealed by large amounts of sand. They activate quickly when {{Term|SS|Link|link}} draws near. This requires {{Term|SS|Link}} to work his way through the maze-like room by using the {{Term|SS|Gust Bellows|link}} to blow away the sand and find a safe path.\n\n==={{TFH|-}}===\n{{Plural|TFH|Floor Spikes}} appear in the {{Term|TFH|Frozen Plateau|link}} level of the {{Term|TFH|Drablands|link}} in {{TFH}}. Here, fireballs can be bounced across them using the {{Term|TFH|Fire Gloves|link}}, which are used to light {{Plural|TFH|Torch|link}} and defeat enemies that are otherwise out of reach.\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\n{{Stub|BotW}}\n{{Plural|BotW|Floor Spikes}} are typically found within {{Plural|BotW|Ancient Shrine|link}}.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n==={{ZA|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n{{Stub|ZA}}\n{{Plural|ZA|Floor Spikes}} appear in {{ZA}}.{{Where}}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==={{CoH|-}}===\n{{Ambig|Start}}\n{{Stub|CoH}}\n\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Names\n|align= left\n|enBr= \n|enBrM= \n|ja= \n|jaM= \n|esS= Suelo de pinchos {{Exp Game|ST}}\n|esSM=  Floor of Spikes\n|esL= Suelo de p\u00faas {{Exp Game|ST}}\n|esLM= Floor of Spikes\n|frF= \n|frFM= \n|frC= \n|frCM= \n|de= \n|deM= \n|it= Pavimento appuntito\n|itM= \n|ptP= \n|ptPM= \n|ptB= \n|ptBM= \n|nl= \n|nlM= \n|ru= \n|ruM= \n|ko= \n|koM= \n|zhT= \n|zhTM= \n|zhS= \n|zhSM= }}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:OoT Floor Spikes Model.png|Invisible {{Plural|OoT|Floor Spikes}} from {{OoT|-}}\nFile:OoS LinkCarryingDodongo.png|{{Term|OoS|Link}} tossing {{Term|OoS|Dodongo}} into {{Plural|OoS|Floor Spikes}} from {{OoS|-}}\nFile:Gust Bellows SS.png|{{Plural|SS|Floor Spikes}} from {{SS|-}}\nFile:TFH Floor Spikes.jpg|{{Plural|TFH|Floor Spikes}} from {{TFH|-}}\nFile:ZA Floor Spikes.jpg|{{Plural|ZA|Floor Spikes}} from {{ZA|-}}\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Enemies}}\n{{Categories\n |Traps\n |enemies= ALttP, LA, LADX, LANS, OoT, OoT3D, OoS, OoA, TWW, TWWHD, FSA, TMC, TP, TPHD, PH, ST, SS, TFH, BotW, ZA\n}}"
