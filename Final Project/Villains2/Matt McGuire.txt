He is the minor antagonist in ''Lizzie McGuire'' portrayed as a scheming, witty, cheeky, young prankster who goes to extreme lengths to continuously annoy and irritate his older sister Lizzie, and sometimes his mom and dad.\n\nAt school, he is known to be the stereotype of the class clown. He is shown to be lazy, and, although he does have many potential talents, he doesn't use them much. He has a best friend named [[Lanny Onasis]], who did not speak on-screen, but Matt was able to understand him, anyway. Matt is also being menaced by a bully named Haywood Biggs. Matt is clever, wily and has a reputation for getting into trouble. He also never liked [[Kate Sanders]] and has also pulled pranks on her. Matt and Lizzie shared a typical brother-sister relationship. They fooled around and annoyed each other, but were always there for each other at the end of each episode. Matt is also rather intelligent and creative, and knows how to humor people.\nHis birthday is September 13.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Matt started kindergarten in 1996.\n*Matt once got his head stuck in the banister, and Gordo helped free him.\n*In the episode \"Election\", Matt pretends to have an imaginary friend, Jasper in order to get attention and gifts from his parents.\n*Matt and Lanny form a rock band, with Rick Marotta as a drummer, but get tired of it after one backyard concert (in Facts of Life).\n\n{{Lizzie McGuire}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGuire, Matt}}\n[[Category:Lizzie McGuire characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
