In the game's story, she kidnaps [[Minnie Mouse]] in an attempt to drain away her youth, beauty and life force as well as assume her physical shape. As a result, [[Mickey Mouse]] has to venture through her castle to rescue Minnie and save her from death.\nShe later returned as the main antagonist of ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]''. In that game, she was sent to [[Cartoon Wasteland|Wasteland]] (due to her becoming a forgotten character, along with the ''Castle of Illusion'' game) and ended up kidnapping other still-popular characters so she could steal their hearts and escape from Wasteland.\n\nIn ''Castle of Illusion'', Mizrabel notably bears some resemblance to [[the Evil Queen]], both in her Queen form and in her Hag form. In ''Power of Illusion'', she is shown shape-shifting into various Disney villains before settling on taking the form of [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.\n\nIn the ''Castle of Illusion'' remake, her true form appears to be a combination of the Queen and Maleficent; she wears a dress similar to that of the Queen's as well as a robe and a crown, but her face bears much greater resemblance to Maleficent's and has her skin color. Also, her cape, though it connects to the sleeves like the Queen's, is ragged and torn like Maleficent's.\n\nAt the end of both versions of ''Castle of Illusion'', Mizrabel reforms after she is defeated by Mickey Mouse (in the remake, it is explained as her learning that Mickey had a far greater magic, which turns out to be the magic of love; Mickey's love for Minnie gives him the strength and courage to go and save her).\n\n==Trivia==\n*When she faces Mickey in ''Power of Illusion'', Mizrabel quotes Maleficent's lines to [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]] and near-quotes Maleficent's lines to [[Prince Phillip]]. This may either be by her choice or that taking on Maleficent's form may have influenced her.\n*Oddly enough, the place in the ''Castle of Illusion'', where the player confronts Mizrabel, is the Forbidden Mountain, Maleficent's home.\n*When Mizrabel appears before Mickey in ''Power of Illusion'', she takes on the forms of villains who AREN'T found in the castle.\n*When Mizrabel is defeated in the remake, she shifts into a second witch form that resembles a recolored version of [[Witch Hazel]].\n**When Mizrabel is defeated in the original, she takes on the form of a female mouse like Minnie and, reformed, guides the two back to safety.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nPower of Illusion..jpg|Mizrabel taking on Maleficent's form in \"Power of Illusion\" promo artwork.\nCastle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse Mizrabelmodel.jpg\nMizrabel.png\nEpic Mickey Power of Illusion artwork.jpg\ndisney-epic-mickey-power-of-illusion-6.jpeg\nCastle-of-Illusion-Starring-Mickey-Mouse-Wallpaper-002.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse]]===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nMickey Mouse vs Queen Mizrabel.jpg|Mickey battling Mizrabel at the end of ''Castle of Illusion''.\nMizrabel cutscene.jpg\nOld Mizrabel.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse (2013 video game)]]===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMisrabelHD.png\nMizrabel attacks.jpg\nMickeyVs Mizrabel.jpg\nMizrabel hagform.jpg\nMizrabelHD.png\nCastle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse Mizrabel.jpg\nCastle-of-Illusion-Starring-Mickey-Mouse-REVIEW-003.jpg\nCastle-of-Illusion-Starring-Mickey-Mouse-REVIEW-004.jpg\nMizrabel end.png|Mizrabel after her defeat\nMIZRABEL1 zps817f80dc.png\nScreenshot 2014-09-25-13-37-59.jpg\nCOL MM7.jpg\ncastle illusion screens 9.jpeg\nCastle-of-Illusion-Tips-and-Tricks-7.jpg\nmaxresdefault232.jpg\nmaxresdefault390.jpg\n227600 screenshots 2014-03-02 00022.jpg|''\"NOOOOOOO!!! - But I wanted to be the fairest of them alllllll....\"''\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nscrn epicMickey3DS dragon.jpg|Mizrabel in the form of [[Maleficent|Dragon Maleficent]] in ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]''.\nMizrabel defeat- Power of Illusion.jpg\nmizrabel 610a.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Epic Mickey}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey Bosses]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]"
