They were some of [[Bellwether]]'s minions.\n\n==Role in the [[Zootopia|film]]==\nWoolter and Jesse arrive at [[Doug (Zootopia)|Doug]]'s\u00a0lab-converted subway car\u00a0to deliver a latte to Doug. Just as Doug demands to know if the latte has extra foam,\u00a0[[Judy Hopps]]\u00a0suddenly shoves Doug out of the train car, locking the three rams outside. After failing to get the rabbit cop to open the door, Jesse contacts [[Bellwether|his superior]] and says that they have a situation at the lab, but upon realizing Judy and\u00a0[[Nick Wilde]]\u00a0are stealing the train car, he and Woolter give chase to the moving train car and climb onto it.\n\nUpon realizing Judy and\u00a0Nick Wilde\u00a0are stealing the train car, he and Woolter give chase to the moving train car and Jesse manages to break through the front window, getting stuck halfway through. As Jesse attempts to grab Judy, Nick tries to push the ram away but gets knocked back. Jesse briefly manages to grab Judy until he is accidentally knocked off of the train (losing his grip on the bunny) by Woolter after the latter charges through a door that was quickly opened by Nick and runs on the tracks, begging Judy and Nick to stop the train.\n\nNarrowly avoiding getting run over, he jumps to the side against a wall and gets the wool on his belly sheared off by the force of the train brushing up against him, much to his complete horror.\n\nAfter Woolter regains consciousness, he notices Judy hanging on to his horns and immediately shakes her off, sending her flying onto the roof of the train car. He then proceeds to try to free himself from the window until he notices Nick driving the car and punches through the glass of the window next to him to get at the fox. As another train is about to collide with them, Nick speeds up the train car at Judy's urging, and Woolter, noticing the other train, panics, and screams for him stop the train. As he continues panicking, Judy kicks him off of the train car and he lands on a track switch, changing the train car's direction.\n\nIt's completely unknown what became of Woolter and Jesse afterwards, but it's likely that they were arrested by the ZPD after Bellwether's plot was exposed, though it could be possible that they could have also flee from Zootopia before that could happen.\n\nDuring the end credits, Jesse is last seen in jail patting on his lap along with Doug watching a live stream of [[Gazelle]]'s concert performance in prison.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Woolter's and Jesse's names respectively are references to the characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman in the crime drama series\u00a0''Breaking Bad''.\n**Additionally, Jesse's eye patch could be a reference to when Jesse Pinkman once had a swollen eye after being beaten.\n*Woolter's shirt says \"Double Ewe\", as a homage to the\u00a0''Double Deuce''\u00a0bar from\u00a0''[[Wikipedia:Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]''.\n\n{{Zootopia}}\n[[Category:Sheep]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]"
