"{{Infobox character\n|image = Dr.Gevaarlijk.jpg\n|shows = ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''\n|voice = [[Jennifer Grey]]\n|occupation = Scientist\n|alignment = Bad}}'''Dr. Gevaarlijk'''\u00a0is a professor of evil science from [[Drusselstein]]. She is a minor character form the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.\n\n==History==\nShe is very short with blonde hair and wears glasses. She was a teacher of Dr.\u00a0[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]]\u00a0when he took Evil Science 101. She hated and tormented him when he was her student. The doctor openly despised him, yet Doofenshmirtz still wanted to impress her.\n\nDoofenshmirtz wrote her a letter inviting her to [[Danville]] to impress her with the enormity of his evil schemes. He tried to show off his inventions and his nemesis,\u00a0[[Perry the Platypus]], who did not do anything. Also in honor of her visit, he planned to blow up the moon with an unnamed laser device to stop all songs about it. She approves of this plan since she, too, despises moon-related songs. Unfortunately, the plan backfires when he leans on the laser and redirects it towards a nearby dam. Because she enjoys a good toe-tapping dam song, she is even less impressed with Doofenshmirtz's schemes.\n\nIn the end, she tells Doofenshmirtz that evil doesn't always have to be on a large scale. He could just spread evil in the little things he does everyday, but that he can't even do that. (\"[[Oil on Candace]]\")\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gevaarlijk is a Dutch word meaning \"dangerous.\" This, plus her accent, means she is likely Dutch. However she also has an accent in the Dutch episodes of Phineas and Ferb, The accent is German-like.\n*When subtitles\u00a0are on during the episode, Gevaarlijk is spelled '''Hevarlick'''.\n*It is unknown if Dr. Gevaarlijk failed Doofenshmirtz because she hated him, or she hated him because he failed. \u00a0\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gevaarlijk}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:European characters]]"
