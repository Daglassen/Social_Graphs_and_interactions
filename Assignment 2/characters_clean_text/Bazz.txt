== Biography ==
Bazz is the captain of the guard of Zora's Domain. He wields a Silverscale Spear. When he was a child, he was the leader of the Big Bad Bazz Brigade, which included himself, Rivan, Gaddison, and Link. Link taught Bazz swordsmanship when he was young.<ref="Blade">"A hundred years ago, you frequently trained me in the art of the blade. Remember?" â€” Bazz (Breath of the Wild)</ref>
While Bazz does find Link to be familiar at first, he has trouble placing where they've met before. When he does finally recognize Link, he decides to test him with the Big Bad Bazz Brigade password to make sure he's correct. He starts with, "Fluffy white clouds! Clear blue..." After Link successfully guesses the word "Zora", Bazz will be convinced that the person he's speaking to is Link. He asks Link what he's been doing for the past 100 years, but doesn't believe Link when he reveals he was sleeping.
Once Bazz has confirmed Link's identity, he'll answer questions for him. Asking who Bazz is causes him to introduce himself, revealing that Link trained him when he was younger. Due to Link's training, Bazz was able to become the captain of the guard. He considers himself to be in Link's debt because of this.
When asked about King Dorephan, Bazz explains that he's the father of Mipha and Sidon. He also reveals that things have been difficult for the Zora.
Bazz is shocked to hear that Link has forgotten Mipha. He shares that Mipha was a princess and was admired and beloved by the Zora. He starts to elaborate on Mipha and Link's relationship, but decides it would be better if he heard it from King Dorephan.
After the "Divine Beast Vah Ruta" Main Quest has been completed, he thanks Link for doing so. While he believes that calming Divine Beast Vah Ruta should have been his job as the captain of the guard, he's unable to handle Shock Arrows. However, even though the trouble has passed, he still plans on protecting Zora's Domain. He can also be seen in the Throne Room as King Dorephan thanks Link.
