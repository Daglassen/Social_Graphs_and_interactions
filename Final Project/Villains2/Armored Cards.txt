Patrolling under the forces of the [[Red Queen]], she sends one of her Cards to arrest one of the [[Frog Servants]] for stealing her tarts. Later when the Knave of Hearts is sent to find Alice, he asks [[Bayard]] to find her to earn his freedom just as a group of cards follows Bayard to where he is leading.\n\nDuring the conversation between [[Tarrant Hightopp|the Mad Hatter]] and the [[Thackery Earwicket|March Hare]] at the tea party while talking about Frabjous Day, Chessur, Mally, Thackery, and Tarrant notice the Knave of Hearts arriving with a group of Armored Cards to which after Bayard approaches the Hatter, telling him to stay away, thinking he is working for the Queen. After Tarrant explains to Alice about his tragic flashback, Bayard, followed by the Cards to which the couple manages to avoid them. Later when Alice is taken to the Red Queen's throne, the Cards take the Hatter to her to which the Cards lower their weapons to prevent the Hatter from escaping.\n\nHaving retrieved the [[Vorpal Sword]] after giving the Bandersnatch her missing eye, the Knave sends the Cards to arrest Alice for unlawful seduction to which the Hatter manages to thwart the two of the Cards. As Alice runs away and arrives at the area where the Bandersnatch's stable is at, to which the Cards, alongside the Knave, surround her and prepare to arrest her. The Bandersnatch comes to the rescue and knocks over the cards preparing to arrest her. Alice, riding to the Bandersnatch, manages to escape and arrive in Marmorea to get help from the [[White Queen]]. They are later seen present attending the execution to which it is suddenly disrupted when Chessur appears, tricking the Executioner. As the Mad Hatter tells all the slaves of the Red Queen's castle to fight against the Red Queen and all the people who used to work for her celebrate, the Queen sends the Cards to release the Jub Jub bird to fight back, followed by the Knave summoning the [[Jabberwocky]] for battle. Later in a plan to slay the Jabberwocky, the Red Queen and the Armored Cards march for battle alongside the White Queen and her Chess Pieces who also prepare for battle. Suddenly, the Cards and the Chess Pieces halt just as the Red Queen and the White Queen face off against each other. As the Red Queen plans to summon the Jabberwocky to go after Alice, the Armored Cards clear the way to make way for the Jabberwocky on the battlefield to which Alice engages in confrontation with him. Later as the Hatter begins to interfere, the Knave of Hearts engages in a confrontation with him just as the Cards and the Chess Pieces clash with each other during the Frabjous Day battle.\n\nDuring the final battle, they clash against the [[Armored Chess Pieces]], alongside Alice's friends while Alice herself faces the Jabberwocky during a violent battle. Throughout the battle, the Tweedle Boys knock out two Armored Cards while Mallymkun, riding on Bayard, is being chased by the Jub Jub Bird. As the Dormouse attacks the Jub Jub Bird, the Bandersnatch barges through a line of Cards causing a domino effect to which the effect stops when a group of Armored Cards are readying a catapult by placing a boulder on it to which it triggers the catapult launching the boulder on the Jub Jub Bird's head. With the Jub Jub Bird crushed by the boulder, the Cards and Chess Pieces continue fighting with each other as the Hatter fights against the Knave just as Alice continues to fight against the Jabberwocky. Ultimately, Alice manages to slay the Jabberwocky to which the Armored Cards stop fighting against the White Queen's allies after noticing what Alice did to the Jabberwocky.\n\nIronically, after Alice slays the Jabberwocky, they despise the Red Queen (though this is not known until later in the movie) and their loyalty to her is solely because she was the ruler at the time, the instant she loses the crown their will to fight for her ceases; one of the soldiers (after the final battle, in which the Red Queen was overthrown) called the Red Queen \"Bloody Big Head\" (an insulting name that the Red Queen despises being called), to which he explains to her that he and the other Cards no longer trust her. Afterward, the Red Queen and the Knave are arrested for their crimes, tyranny, and betrayal. Following the arrests of Iracebeth and Stayne, the Armored Cards and the Armored Chess Pieces drop their weapons in peace.\n\n===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===\nNone of the Cards make a physical appearance in the current Underland timeline. When Alice tries to find evidence of the disappearance of Tarrant's family, it is revealed that they were captured by the Armored Cards under the Red Queen's orders.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBb4401508ba11b483005e024ac4d4bfa.jpg\nArmoured Cards-0.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
