Molo is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Molo is a regular at the Woodland Stable. During the day on clear weather, he sits out at the Stable's patio drinking from a mug. When Link speaks with him, he complains that he is conflicted coming up with a decision. He claims that the only way to get through life is by raiding, and says that Hyrule Castle is rumored to be brimming with abandoned treasure. The only obstacle he faces are the monsters swarming the area. He asks Link for his input, who can either advise that he pursues it, takes it easy, or ignore him and bid him farewell. No matter what advice Link gives, Molo is certain about raiding the Castle. He tells Link that he can enter the Castle through its northern Docks. He also adds that an Ancient Shrine is supposed to be somewhere around there, referring to the Saas Ko'sah Shrine.
Molo is completely blind to the dangers that lurk in Hyrule Castle, believing that the reason why no one who went there has ever returned is because they struck rich and are now living lavishly.
