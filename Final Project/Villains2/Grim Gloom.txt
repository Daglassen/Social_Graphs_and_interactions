As shown in \"The Itsy Bitsy Spider Fighters,\" he has a fear of spiders and ladybugs. His ancestor once ruled [[Jollywood]] until the Seven Founding Fathers defeated him.\n\n===Personality===\nGrim isn't the brightest spark in Jollywood. He doesn't always comprehend situations as quickly as Hildy does. He can also be a bit dim-witted, especially when he steals a goose from a giant and has no idea it's the one that lays golden eggs.\n\nHowever, what he lacks in intelligence, Grim compensates for in love for his wife. Often going to great lengths to please Hildy, Grim seems to live only to please her. He seeks her approval, and while he isn't always successful, he never stops trying. The pair are clearly dedicated to one another. Their signature \"nose-kiss\" is a perfect example.\n\nGrim is often exploited by Hildy. She often loses her patience with Grim when he cannot grasp her brilliant plans to take over Jollywood. However, it has been shown that she cannot live without him. In the episode, \"Grim the Genius,\" Hildy becomes devastated when Grim becomes smart enough to think for himself. When his sweet disposition goes sour, Hildy allows the 7D to take back the Smarty-Pants Stone. She whimpers that \"I just want my Grimmy-whimmy back.\"\n\n<big>''Physical Appearance''</big>\n\nGrim is a slender young man with blue hair with a lightning bolt, pale lavender skin, and a mole on the right side of his cheek. He wore a gray trenchcoat over a purple dress shirt, a blue tie, black pants, and purple tennis shoes.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Grim and Hildy's names are derived from Grimhilde, [[the Evil Queen]]'s alternate name that was given in early publicity materials.\n*Grim was originally going to have green hair instead of blue, a green shirt instead of purple, a black tie instead of blue and green shoes instead of purple.\n\n{{The 7D}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gloom, Grim}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The 7D characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Warlocks]]\n[[Category:Ostrich]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Skunks]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
