He only appears in a few episodes assisting Brad with [[Pantsy]]. He is a Japanese/American person (just like Kendall). His hair is covering his eyes,he has yellow rotten teeth,he wears an orange wrist band and he is 1/3 dumb. He and Pantsy sometimes are appearing as cameos. Nothing much is known about him,but he was a life guard in Pool Daze. As a life guard,he took his job way too serious (just like Pantsy at the Megaplex),but he is a life guard only on training,along with Pantsy and Brad. He was voiced by [[Greg Cipes]].\n\n\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
