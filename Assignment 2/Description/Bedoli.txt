She and {{Term|BotW|Laissa|link}} live together in a home near {{Term|BotW|Akh Va'quot Shrine|link}}. During the day, she can be found walking around {{Term|BotW|Revali's Landing|link}}.\n\nWhen spoken to initially, Bedoli asks if {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} has seen [[Divine Beast Vah Medoh]], admitting everyone in the village is unsure what to do.<ref>{{Cite|I take it you've seen {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Medoh}}? Everyone is at a loss as to what to do...|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> Every time she looks up, she can't help but sigh, and she wonders when the village will be able to relax again.<ref>{{Cite|I can't help but sigh every time I look skyward. When will we be able to go back to living a relaxed life here?|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter Vah Medoh has been appeased, Bedoli becomes so excited she doesn't realize that she's started singing an old song.<ref>{{Cite|I heard that {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Medoh}} has been appeased. It just sends my heart soaring! I didn't even realize I had started singing this old song.|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> She asks Link if he heard her sing.<ref>{{Cite|Did you hear me singing it?|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks Bedoli to teach him, she claims that's embarrassing.<ref>{{Cite|[Teach it to me!] Huh? Well that's embarrassing...|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> However, while Bedoli sings the song for Link, she doesn't remember all of it.<ref>{{Cite|*ahem* The pride of the Rito, pillar in the sky, its heart lights up, when the sun is high. ...Uhhh. There's more to the song, but I forget the rest of the words.|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> She directs Link to find Laissa, which initiates the {{Term|BotW|Shrine Quest|link}} \"[[The Ancient Rito Song]]\".<ref name=\"Sister\"/>\n\nSpeaking to Laissa, she comments that Bedoli's memory is terrible.<ref name=\"Memory\"/> Once Link has learned the second half, he can return to Bedoli, who claims she remembers the rest of the words.<ref>{{Cite|So you asked {{Color|BotW Blue|my sister}}, {{Color|BotW Blue|Laissa}}, to recite the rest of the song? I also remembered the rest of the words. Do you want to hear them?|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> She's able to recite the whole song,<ref>{{Cite|The pride of the Rito, pillar in the sky, its heart lights up when the sun is high. The heart shines upon a path not whole, but a warming flame can stir its soul.|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> and she's not sure what it means.<ref>{{Cite|But still... What does it all mean? Not knowing bothers me...|Bedoli|BotW}}</ref> At any time afterwards, Link can approach Bedoli to have her recite the song again.<ref>{{Cite|The song I've been humming is one that's been passed down in this village.
