It is on a little world, a human world. They would wield its power, but [[Loki Laufeyson|our ally]] knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead, and our force, our [[Chitauri]], will follow. A world will be his, the universe [[Thanos|yours]]. And the humans, what can they do but burn?|The Other|The Avengers }}\n\n'''The Other''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appears in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]] ''and reappears in'' [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. He is a servant of [[Thanos]] who provides\u00a0[[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] with the [[Chitauri]] and is killed by [[Ronan the Accuser]].\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Physical appearance ===\nThe Other is a diminutive, hooded figure wearing a decorative cloak. His flesh is blue and gaunt, with long fingers and small, round yellow eyes with small black pupils reminiscent of a hawk.\n\n=== Personality ===\nThe Other's personality is mysterious and arguably under-developed, what is known is that he is extremely loyal to Thanos, has a high vocabulary, and is good at mimicry and intimidation. He considers humans \"cowering wretches\" and the might of planet Earth \"meager\".\n\n=== Powers and abilities ===\nThe Other possessed super speed, which he used to help him intimidate Loki.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]''===\nThe Other serves [[Thanos]], who is helping [[Loki Laufeyson]]. When Loki has arrived on Earth, Thanos is contacted by him, and after Loki successfully swipes the [[Scepter]], the Other threatens the God of Mischief, declaring that if he fails in defeating the Earthlings, Thanos will make him know a new kind of suffering.\n\nWhen eventually Loki is defeated, the Other complains to Thanos that the Earth's inhabitants are not as weak as they were supposed to be, he declares that challenging [[Avengers|the Earth's heroes]] would be to court Death. To this, Thanos simply smiles.\n\n===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''===\nThe Other still serves Thanos, who has enlisted the aid of\u00a0[[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]],\u00a0[[Korath]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Nebula]]\u00a0to find the\u00a0[[Orb]]. Thanos promised Ronan that he will help Ronan destroy Xandar in exchange for his services.\n\nWhen [[Gamora]] is captured by the [[Nova Corps]], The Other communicates with Ronan to inform him Thanos wants to have a meeting with him. Already in the Sanctuary of Thanos, Ronan blames Gamora for the loss but The Other disagrees and blames him, Ronan, tired of being bossed around by both Thanos and the Other, eventually snaps the Other's neck, killing him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the comics, \"The Other\" was an alias of [[Wikipedia:Chthon|Chthon]] the Elder God. However, the Marvel Cinematic Universe portrays the Other as a separate character.\n*The Other is one of few major antagonists in the MCU not to be killed in their debut appearance, the others being [[Abomination]], [[Leader]], [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], [[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]], [[Vulture (Marvel)|Vulture]], [[Thanos]], [[Ghost]], and [[Agatha Harkness]]\n*The first and last lines of ''The Avengers'' are both spoken by The Other.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n====''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]''====\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nTheAvengers-0030.jpg\nThe Other Avengers.jpg\nTheAvengers-1195.jpg\nTheAvengers-1205.jpg\nTheAvengers-1219.jpg\nTheAvengers-1225.jpg\nLokiwithTheOther.png\nTheAvengers-5306.jpg\nTheAvengers-5308.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n====''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''====\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nTheOtherHologram-GOTG.png\nTheOther-Nebula-Ronan-Thanos.jpg\nRonanTheOtherArguing-GOTG.png\nTDW1106_comp_v005.1075.jpg\nTheOtherFace-GOTG.png\nTheOtherDeath-GOTG.png|The Other's death\n</gallery>\n\n===Concept and Production===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nNebula,_Gunn_and_The_Other_BTS.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{MarvelMoviesWiki}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Other, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Guardians of the Galaxy characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
