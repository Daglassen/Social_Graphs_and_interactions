Yiga Footsoldiers will often teleport around the area, levitating and shooting {{Term|BotW|Link}} with a {{Term|BotW|Duplex Bow}}. If wielding either a {{Term|BotW|Vicious Sickle}} or a {{Term|BotW|Demon Carver}}, they will teleport above {{Term|BotW|Link}} and {{Term|Series|Down Thrust|link}} into the ground with their weapon, telegraphing the attack with a glowing red ring of nine {{Term|Series|Hylian Language#Sixth Hylian Script|link|display=Hylian letters}}. These letters parallel the nine {{Term|BotW|Sheikah Language|link|display=Sheikah letters}} preceding some of {{Term|BotW|Monk Maz Koshia|link}}'s attacks.\n\nWhile infiltrating the {{Term|BotW|Yiga Clan Hideout}}, {{Plural|BotW|Yiga Blademaster|link}} will summon two {{Plural|BotW|Yiga Footsoldier}} if {{Term|BotW|Link}} is spotted. When defeated, {{Plural|BotW|Yiga Footsoldier}} will teleport away, dropping their weapon and leaving behind a random amount of {{Plural|BotW|Mighty Bananas}} and {{Plural|BotW|Rupee}}.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n==={{SSBU|-}}===\nThough Yiga Footsoldier's do not appear directly in {{SSBU}}, items resembling the attire worn by Yiga Footsoldiers known as the [[Yiga Clan Mask]] and the [[Yiga Clan Outfit]] appear as a [[Mii Headgear]] for all [[Mii Fighter]]s and a [[Mii Outfit]] for [[Mii Swordfighter]]s respectively. Mii Swordfighters disguised as Yiga Footsoldiers appear in [[Sheik#Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Sheik]]'s and [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]]'s [[Classic Mode]] Routes, \"[[Masquerade]]\" and \"[[Wisdom Prevails]]\", with the latter appearance referencing the Yiga Footsoldiers' goal of assassinating Zelda in {{BotW}}.\n\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Stub|HWAoC}}\n{{Plural|HWAoC|Yiga Footsoldier}} retroactively debut in {{HWAoC}}, now having voice acting and are fought both in {{Term|HWAoC|Gerudo Town|link}} and the {{Term|HWAoC|Gerudo Desert|link}}, and several other scenarios. They appear as the weakest soldiers of the Yiga Clan.  Two {{Plural|HWAoC|Yiga Footsoldier}} are also seen kneeling before [[Astor]] in the {{Term|HWAoC|Lost Woods|link}}. On top of that, there is a new variant that stands at about twice the size of a regular {{Term|HWAoC|Yiga Footsoldier}}. Each can switch between their {{Term|HWAoC|Vicious Sickle}} and {{Term|HWAoC|Duplex Bow}} at will and can sustain much more damage; they act as {{Term|Series|Captain (Hyrule Warriors)|link|display=Keep Bosses}}. Later in the game, they are sacrificed to revive the Blight Ganons [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|after they failed to kill the Champions]], causing the Yiga Clan to join their former enemies to take down Astor and later, Ganon. They disguise themselves as Hylain Soldiers during \"{{Term|HWAoC|The Yiga Clan Attacks!|link}}\" and even slip into their old Sheikah professions to infiltrate the [[Royal Ancient Lab Ruins|Royal Ancient Lab]] in an attempt to stop [[Robbie]] and [[Purah]] from learning the full results of analyzing [[Terrako]].<ref>{{Cite|I was too careless.
