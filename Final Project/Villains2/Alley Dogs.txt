When the alley dogs spot Oliver, they begin to chase him, so as to eat him. Luckily, Oliver escapes by jumping over a fence while the dogs remain behind the fence. They aren't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this until somewhere in the climax when Oliver is with his dog friends singing ''[[Streets of Gold]]'', another vicious alley dog jumps into the scene and chases Oliver until he is scared off by [[Dodger]] and the gang's growling and runs away like a yellow cowardly dog. He isn't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTumblr_n83xwloReh1qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg|Alley dogs noticing [[Oliver]]\nOliver-disneyscreencaps.com-270.jpg|Alley dogs No. 1\nOliver-disneyscreencaps.com-275.jpg|Alley dogs chasing Oliver\nOliver-disneyscreencaps.com-292.jpg|Alley dogs, behind the fence, trying to catch up with Oliver/Alley dogs' defeat\nOliver-disneyscreencaps.com-3256.jpg|Alley dog No. 2\nOliver-disneyscreencaps.com-3257.jpg|Alley dog chasing Oliver\noliver-disneyscreencaps.com-3260.jpg|Alley dog spooked by [[Dodger]] and the gang's growling\noliver-disneyscreencaps.com-3266.jpg|Alley dog running away scared/Alley dog's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Oliver & Company}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Oliver & Company characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
