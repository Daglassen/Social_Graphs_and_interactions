He also lives with his overbearing mother [[Edna]], who is a dragon. Carl is always trying to find a way to impress his face and out-do his brother [[Brother Herman the Evil Ant|Herman]]. Despite the differences between Carl and Herman, they have worked together on occasion, making a deadly force against Yin and Yang. It was shown in the episode \"[[Mission Yinpossible]]\" that his heart's desire was for his mother to love him more than Herman (even though he himself believed that it was to rule the world), but after realizing how she was suffocating him with love, he no longer yearns for it. A bit of a priss, it was shown in \"[[Get Off My Back]]\" that he is an excellent cook, and a great groomer.\n\nCarl seems to have a thing for blocking out the sun anywhere, as shown in episodes like \"[[An Inconvenient Tooth]]\", \"[[Too Much Yangformation]]\" and \"[[Yin Yang You!|Yin Yang You]]\" (which is accurate for a cockroach, as most cockroaches hate the sunlight). His idea was stolen from Herman and the [[Night Master]] himself, which still irritates him to this day. In \"[[Cat Smash Fever]]\", Carl seems to have created an Ad that reads \"Desperate Cockroach Seeks Soulmate\", in which he even admits was desperate.\n\n==Biography ==\n==Background ==\n==Information ==\n==Personality==\n==Powers and Abilities==\nCarl has displayed sorcery on many occasions. Carl is stronger than Yin and Yang in power, but if someone criticizes him, he easily loses focus. Such an example could be seen in \"[[Night Fall]]\", where he was able to wipe out a good portion of the [[Night Master]]'s Army all by himself. It is revealed in [[Yin, Yang, Carl]] that he could defeat Herman in a fight (Master Yo demonstrated this while he was in Carl's body and acquired his powers).\n\n==Paraphernalia ==\n==Appearance ==\n==Appearances==\n==Notes==\n==Trivia==\n\n*Because of the 2nd opening of Yin Yang Yo, many fans believed that Carl would've been the new Night Master of the new season.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCarl crystal ball.jpg\nOverlord Carl.jpg\nHuman Yin Yang.png|Carl as a human\n</gallery>\n\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
