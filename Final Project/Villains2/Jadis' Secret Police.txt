The wolves part of the Secret Police follow and obey their ruthless captain. Due to their high intelligence, they are capable of using their powerful senses of smelling, sight, and hearing whenever it comes to Jadis' enemies.\n\nAccording to Mr. Tumnus, it is also said that some of Jadis' spies part of the Secret Police not only consist of wolves, but also include trees, which watch anything that goes around Narnia. It is also nearly impossible to know which trees work for Jadis or which ones are not affiliated with her, since the trees are usually seen immobile.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAfter [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] arrives in [[Narnia]] and meets up with [[Tumnus]] to which during night time, Tumnus takes Lucy back to the entrance to the real world where he warns Lucy that Jadis may have known that Lucy entered Narnia. Tumnus then warns her that the forest is filled with spies, in which according to Tumnus, some of the trees are even followers of the White Witch part of the Secret Police.\n\nAs the Pevensies arrive at Narnia via wardrobe, they enter Mr. Tumnus' house as [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] looks at a warrant which reads: \"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged with High Treason against Her Imperial Majesty, Jadis, Queen of Narnia, for comforting her enemies and fraternizing with humans. Signed [[Maugrim]], Captain of the Secret Police. Long Live the Queen\", followed by a wolf paw print marked on it as it is linked to Maugrim. Susan explains to Peter that the wolves mentioned on the note are part of Jadis' police force. Later during a conversation with the beavers at their dam, [[Mr. Beaver]] explains to the Pevensies about Tumnus' arrest and the Secret Police to which it is known that the beavers are talking about a prophecy in defeating the White Witch and saving Narnia to restore peace.\n\nAs [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] arrives at Jadis' Courtyard, he encounters Maugrim, followed by [[Jadis the White Witch|Jadis]] and [[Ginarrbrik]] in a plan to ask her for Turkish delight while Jadis sends in Maugrim to send in the Secret Police to destroy the beavers' dam. Maugrim then howls to summon the wolves part of the Secret Police to do Jadis' task as they run across the forest to destroy the dam.\n\nAs the wolves arrive at the beavers' dam, they begin to cause damage to their home just as Peter, Susan, Lucy, and the beavers escape the dam via tunnel. Having escaped the beavers' home and encountered a [[Fox (Narnia)|talking fox]], the wolves then surround him just as the Pevensies and the beavers watch the Fox attacked by the wolves to which when Maugrim asks the Fox to know where the fugitives are, he explains to the wolves that they ran north to which the wolves then arrive north thanks to the Fox who escaped from them. Jadis then arrives back to Edmund and explains to her that her police force destroyed the beavers' dam, much to Edmund's concern.\n\nThe next day, Peter, [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], Lucy, and the beavers arrive at the Great River while Edmund is captured by Jadis to which they hear wolves howling from a distance just as the group notices the wolves leaping down at the glacier as they surround the three to which Peter prepares to kill Maugrim to which Maugrim tells him to put away his sword just as the ice begins to crack to which Peter is troubled by Maugrim, Susan, and Mr. Beaver's sayings while on the glacier. As the ice begins to melt, Peter uses his sword to crack the ice to lose the wolves. As the season of spring arrives at Narnia, the Secret Police arrives to their master, explaining that they found the Fox rallying his allies at the Shuddering Woods to which Jadis petrified the Fox by turning him into stone just as she tells the wolves to rally against Aslan if it was a war Aslan wants.\n\nWith Maugrim dead at the hands of Peter during his first fight, the Secret Police lost its captain as the surviving wolves retreat. The wolves are later present during Aslan's sacrifice at the Stone Table to which during the sacrifice, Aslan gets his mane shaved as he is placed on top of the Stone Table. As the sacrifice begins, the wolves then howl as the other minions celebrate. After Aslan dies during the sacrifice, the wolves howl again as the other minions continue to celebrate, much to Lucy and Susan's sadness to Aslan who died during this tragic event.\n\nDuring Jadis' plan to take over Narnia, the wolves part of the Secret Police then participate in battle with the rest of the evil creatures part of Jadis's army. Just as Aslan's army charges across the battlefield and clashes with Jadis' army, the wolves part of the Secret Police fight against Aslan's army as a violent battle rages across Beruna. After Jadis dies during battle at the hands of Aslan, the battle ends with the Secret Police being disbanded and the Pevensies become kings and queens of Narnia.\n\n==Video game appearances==\n===[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game)|''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (video game)]]===\nWolves part of Jadis' Secret Police appear as enemies in the video game adaptation of the Disney film. They are capable of attacking the Pevensies under orders of the White Witch. Additionally unlike in the film, members of Jadis' Secret Police join battle in \"The Great River\" level where they begin attacking the Pevensies across Aslan's Camp during the battle against Maugrim.\n\nThere are two special abilities that are related to wolves. For Lucy, the Wolf Tame ability allows her to ride on wolves after striking a wolf three times. The Wolf Bane ability allows Peter or Edmund to defeat a wolf in one hit.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The extended version of the film adds more footage of the Secret Police destroying the beavers' dam, which was not present in the original theatrical release.\n\n{{The Chronicles of Narnia}}\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
