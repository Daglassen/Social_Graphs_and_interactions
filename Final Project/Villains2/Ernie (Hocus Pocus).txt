Like Jay, he addresses Max as \"Hollywood\".\n\n==Role in the film==\nIce steals Max's shoes when Max says he does not have cash or bud for either him or Jay. \n\nLater, Ice is stealing candy from trick-or-treaters with Jay when they confront Max again. This time, they ask him about his costume which happens to be a \"Little Leaguer\" as referred by Max's sister, [[Dani Dennison|Dani]]. At that moment, Ice forces her to pay a toll in order for her to pass by him, but Max stops him by giving them his candy.\n\nLater at 3am, the bullies are trying to think of some other activity to do (due to most of the Halloween activities having ended) when they encounter the [[The Sanderson Sisters|Sanderson sisters]] due to [[Mary Sanderson|Mary]] having smelled Max's scent on the shoes Ice took from him earlier. The sisters abduct Ice and Jay and lock them up in cages hanging from the ceiling of [[The Sanderson Sisters' Cottage|their cottage]] after Jay refers to them as \"ugly chicks\", which offends them. When Max and Allison later arrive to rescue Dani, whom the sisters have abducted, Ice and Jay beg to be saved, to which Max responds by stealing back his shoes from Ice and leaving them there as payback for their bullying.\n\nAfter the Sanderson sisters disappear off the face of the Earth at dawn, Ice and Jay are still in their cages and singing songs including \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" to fill in the time before any citizen of Salem will find and release them from their imprisonment.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIce is a stocky and short medium teenager. He has brown hair and is of moderately muscular but weak build. \n\nHis clothing consists of a dark beige trench coat, long orange pants, a green T-shirt underneath, a bowler hat, a gold chain, and originally simple brown shoes. After their first meeting, he wears the Nike basketball shoes of Max.\n\nAfter retrieving his tennis shoes, Ice is shown wearing white socks with holes in one of his heels.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nHocus-pocus-disneyscreencaps.com-1894.jpg|Ernie shows his nickname, Ice, shaved on the back of his head.\nErnie with Jay.png|Discussing with Jay before the sister's appear.\nHocus-pocus-disneyscreencaps.com-8069.jpg|Ernie locked in his cage.\nErnie Nike shoes.png|Ernie wearing the sneakers of Max.\nHocus-pocus-disneyscreencaps.com-11096.jpg|Ernie and Jay in their cages in the cottage.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hocus Pocus}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Hocus Pocus characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
