Max knocks on his window again and he said there was no circus and not closed, but they're always to be closed from this moment on. He asked and told Pistol, P.J. and Max that if they're not out of here in ten seconds, he's going to have Giblet the Clown sit on them. He threatens to turn a group of Pistol's circus animals (including Kitty the lion, Annie the elephant, Kong the monkey, Puppy the seal, and Boris the bear) into puppy chow. After Pistol freed the circus animals, the Ringmaster and Giblet the Clown followed them in hot pursuit. When the circus truck was accidentally crashed over a bridge, her animals helped Pistol to safety.\n\nHaving overheared The Ringmaster and Giblet's plot to turn the animals into puppy chow, Pete stood up to the Ringmaster by grabbing him by the suit and warning him that he is not gonna turn the animals that saved Pistol into dog food, and shoving his money into the Ringmaster's mouth. He told the Ringmaster that they are now his animals, ordering him to get his cage and his truck out of his sight, but the Ringmaster reminded him that his truck was down in the moat after spitting the money out. Pete kicked both him and Giblet in their butts and send them falling off a bridge and into the moat below. It is unknown what happened to them afterwards.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRingmaster from Goof Troop - 3.jpg|\"Good!\"\nRingmaster from Goof Troop - 1-1.jpg|\"What do you kids want?\"\nRingmaster from Goof Troop - 1.jpg|\"Yes!\" The Ringmaster yelled at Max from knocking his ticket window again.\nRingmaster from Goof Troop - 2.jpg|\"But there is no, not closed.
