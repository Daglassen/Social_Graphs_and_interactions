At one point, however, Cain reveals that he has had feelings for Leah and wanted her\u00a0all\u00a0to himself, but\u00a0she rejects him. Akela and Leah then decide to leave the pack. When Cain and his pack give chase, Akela and Leah manage to escape and seek refuge in the [[Ancient Ruins|lair]] without knowing it belongs to the cubs. After [[Colonel Hathi|Hathi]] panics at the sight of the two wolves and flees, Akela and Leah laugh awkwardly and decide to rest where they are.\n\nSometime later, the cubs\u00a0have a falling-out with Akela and Leah, who both eventually decide to leave. However, when Cain and his pack arrive at the lair and plan to attack, Akela and the cubs all stand up to him. Akela and Cain then engage in a brutal fight over Leah. In the aftermath, Akela defeats Cain and then orders him to leave the cubs' lair and never return.
