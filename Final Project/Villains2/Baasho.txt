He is the prince - [[Banagi]]'s - assistant, and also his tool. In ''King of the Jungle'' [[Banagi]] bites of a section of [[Simba]]'s tail and leads [[Mufasa]] to his doom at the paws of [[Scar]].\n\n==Appearance==\nBaasho is a milky brown hyena with darker brown spots, his tail, muzzle, and ears tipped in black. His mane is also a darker brown. At night his eyes are a bright red.\n\n==Personality==\nBaasho is so loyal to [[Banagi]] that he doesn't seem to have much a personality that one could call his own. He is rather blank. However, once [[Mufasa]] is dead and [[Scar]] is upon the throne, his loyalty, like his mind, begins to waver.\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baasho}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Hyenas]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion King characters]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lieutenants]]\n[[Category:African characters]]"
