She has the same powers of her father and known as the villain '''Sandgirl'''. She is voiced by [[Sofia Carson]] in ''[[Spider-Man  (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[Sandman|Flint Marko]] took Keemia everywhere he went. One night he took her to a factory in [[New Jersey]] where she was ordered to stay in the car. After sitting alone for some time, she got scared, left the car, and entered the factory, where she saw her father get covered in sand. She was later covered in the same sand. When [[Hammerhead]] started to leave, he found her buried in sand. He saved her and trained her to control her powers.\n\nLater, a monstrous sand creature attacks her while she was at the [[Coney Island]] fair where she is later saved by [[Spider-Man]]. From there she left and met up with Hammerhead. The next time she appeared, she was at Hammerhead's estate, where she took on and defeated her father Sandman. She was winning against Spider-Man when the [[Symbiotes|Symbiote]] took control and saved the hero's life. From there she was easily defeated by the black suit Spider-Man. She jumps through a window and escapes into the night.\n\n==Powers==\nShe has the same powers of [[Sandman]]. She was able to stabilize her sand molecules much more easily than the original Sandman, yet she still has a piece of her face missing.\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
