She was imprisoned inside a magical locket and was found by [[Prisma]].\n==Background==\nVor was the first villain to come to be in the [[EverRealm]]. The physical embodiment of evil, she used the power of her magic ring to spread evil throughout the world in an attempt to conquer it. However, she fell foul of the Protectors who ganged up on and managed to defeat her, destroying her physical body and imprisoning her spirit inside a locket.\n\nBefore she was defeated by the Protectors, however, Vor split her magic ring into pieces and placed them inside the [[Wicked Nine]], nine magical objects that would fall into the hands of history's most [[Disney Villains|devious villains]]. Because these objects would unleash unspeakable power when brought together, the Protectors scattered these nine objects all over the EverRealm. As for Vor herself, the locket containing her consciousness was locked away in a Crystal Lock-fitted safe in the Terrible Tower section of the Protector Fortress in the [[Mystic Isles]], where it remained for many years.\n\n===Personality===\nVor is basically described as conniving,\u00a0vain, crafty and completely evil with absolutely no redeeming qualities.\u00a0She is very sly and manipulative as she played\u00a0[[Prisma]]\u00a0like a fiddle when using her\u00a0to find\u00a0the  [[Wicked Nine]]  to release her from her locket.\n\nOnce she is freed from the locket, she drops her calm facade and reveals her nature as a twistedly\u00a0evil\u00a0and psychopathic tyrant who\u00a0will not hesitate to hurt or even kill those who get in her way--including children and even other innocents\u00a0who've done nothing to her.\u00a0\n\nVor is also extremely sadistic as she states that she wants for Sofia to suffer in the worst way possible by taking everything she owns and loves.\n\nYet, despite Vor's success in conquering\u00a0Enchancia and the EverRealm, she can never seem to be satisfied with her\u00a0tyrannical\u00a0conquests as she reveals that she has future plans to extend her reign even further.\u00a0\n\nAll in all, Vor's overconfidence and pure dark heart is what ultimately does her in (both figuratively and literally).\n\n==Role in the [[Sofia the First|series]]==\nVor first appears in \"[[The Mystic Isles: The Falcon's Eye]]\". After Prisma's capture, she was locked into a cell next to where Vor's safe is. This proves to be a mistake: Prisma recognizes the Locket for what it is and sees it as the key to her freedom. After a strangeling named [[Twitch (Sofia the First)|Twitch]] shows up, Prisma tells him how to get the Locket for her since she knows about Crystal Locks due to the fact she and her sister Azurine made them all the time. After Twitch gets it, Prisma opens the Locket and awakens\u00a0Vor. She tells Prisma about the Wicked Nine and how, if the objects are brought to her, she will get her powers back. Twitch goes to get the first one for Prisma. When he returns with a Necessi-Key, Prisma breaks out and goes to get them herself.\n\nWhat Prisma doesn't know however, is that Vor plans to take the power of Wicked Nine for\u00a0herself and be free from her accursed locket. The objects all contain fragments of Vor's ring, which is the source of her evil magic - the key to her release.\n\nIn the series finale ''[[Forever Royal]]'', Vor succeeds in bringing all of the Wicked Nine together and reforms her magic ring, releasing her from the locket that the Protectors trapped her in long ago as well. In need of a corporeal form, Vor's spirit possesses Prisma and becomes a physical entity. Seeking revenge and power, Vor enlists Wormwood and Twitch as her minions and traps the Protectors with a powerful spell they cannot break, then uses a mind control spell to force [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]]'s mentor, [[Chrysta]], to lure the princess to the Mystic Isles under false pretenses so as to eliminate her as a threat. Vor then seals the gates of the Isles and takes off to conquer the Ever Realm, starting with Sofia's home of [[Enchancia]]. With shards of crystal from her former prison, Vor creates an army of Crystal Minions and sets off to conquer Enchancia Castle. Sofia rallies her friends from the village\u00a0to stop her, but Vor easily subdues them with her mind control magic, forcing them to tell her where the princess is.\n\nVor appears before Sofia at the castle bridge and attacks her, causing the princess lose her balance and\u00a0fall off the bridge before [[Minimus]] manages to catch her. Vor watches the two fly into the distance, intending for Sofia to helplessly watch as she steals everything she owns and loves. Vor then invades the castle, where she places King [[Roland II|Roland]] and his family under her mind control spell to force Roland surrender his crown (which she then incinerates into a pile of ash) and then imprison themselves.\n\nVor then plunges Enchancia into darkness and prepares to conquer all the other kingdoms, with future plans on taking over [[Neverland]]\u00a0(and later [[London]]\u00a0and possibly all of Earth) once she is done there. Having freed her family, Sofia invokes her [[Amulet of Avalor]] to trap the wicked sorceress inside it, like it had done with [[Princess Elena]]. But\u00a0Vor manages to snag Sofia's ankle with her magic, and drags her inside as well despite the efforts of her sister Princess Amber to stop it.\n\nInside the Amulet, Vor\u00a0gloatingly taunts the princess with the fact that there are no friends who can help her inside the Amulet, while repeatedly striking her away with her dark magic. However, Sofia sees the spirits of the\u00a0[[Disney Princesses]]\u00a0who helped her in her times of need. She uses them and the love she feels for her family and friends to overcome Vor's dark magic, causing the wicked sorceress to dissolve into nonexistence once and for all, also releasing a repentant Prisma from her control.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Vor's spirit form has a similar appearance to the spirit of the Evil Queen's [[Magic Mirror]]. In her human form, she appears to be a combination of the [[The Evil Queen|Evil Queen]] and [[Maleficent]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nLocket of Vor.png|The spirit of Vor inside the locket\nVor's spirit appears by shocked Prisma.jpg|The spirit of Vor appears before Prisma\nVor appears before Prisma.png|\"Open your hand.\"\nGhost of Vor hands Prisma her ring, explaining she's freed.jpg|\"My power is restored, and I'm freed from the locket!\"\nVor reincarnated.png|Vor reincarnated as she takes full control of Prisma\nFR Vor claims herself as Wormwood & Twitch's new master.png|\"You have a new master now, my pets.\"\nFR Vor's Evil Grin.jpg\nFR Vor and Her Evil Companions.png\nFR Vor reveals herself to the Protectors.png|\"Why, hello, everyone.
