Carter is submissive and cautions while Trygstad is determined and aggressive.\n\nCarter is portrayed by Gabriel Casseus and Trygstad is portrayed by Jack Conley.\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Ben asked the FBI was here, Terrell referenced them as the ''[[Wikipedia:Men in black|Men in Black]]''. It also shows similarities with their position within the government, with the FBI searching for \"genetic guinea pigs\" as the MIB covers up UFO conspiracy theories.\n**It also shows similarities with two agents yet differences with their personalities: Carter represents [[Wikipedia:Agent J|Agent J]] and Trygstad represents [[Wikipedia:Agent K|Agent K]].\n*During the chase sequence, there is somewhat an error; in the first scene Carter and Trygstad drive a Ford Expedition MAX, though it is later switched to a Chevrolet Suburban.\n{{G-Force}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:G-Force characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]"
