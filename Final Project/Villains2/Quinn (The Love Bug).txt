Just when they are about to get on their way, an orphaned pickpocket named [[Paco]] steals their wallet containing some important film that would help them find the lost city. They begin a manhunt for him but fail to get to him after Herbie helps him escape and get aboard a cruise ship to [[Panama]].\n\nIn Panama, Quinn and Prindle are waiting for Paco while he's being escorted off the ship but manages to escape. However, they soon find him and make him get back their missing film otherwise they will cut up [[Herbie]]. Showing they mean it, Quinn lights a blowtorch and aims it at him. Paco succeeds in getting the film back but double-crosses them. This soon leads to chase out of Panama and into a bullring where a bull knocks their car onto its side and they lose Paco and Herbie. (In this sequence its shown he has a fear for bulls when an angry bullfighter leaves his red cape hanging on his side of the car.)\n\nThey regroup with Shepard and continue their search for Paco and Herbie by plane. They manage to find them and trick Paco into picking up a passenger. They capture him and fly off leaving behind Herbie to go for help. Prindle, Shepard, and Quinn find the Inca ruins and to their delight an antique gold disc. They lose the gold when Herbie captures it and drives away into the dark jungle. They succeed in getting the gold back and try to escape in their plane but due to the extra weight, they have problems taking off giving Herbie and Paco a fighting chance. While trying to escape, Quinn has trouble keeping the heavy gold under control as it rolls back and forth inside the plane. In the end, he and his partners are arrested and lose the gold.\n\n{{The Love Bug}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
