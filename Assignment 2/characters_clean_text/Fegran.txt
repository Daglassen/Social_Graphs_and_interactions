Fegran is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Fegran is a Gerudo who can be found standing just past the front entrance of Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to Fegran, she congratulates him on making it to Gerudo Town with the Divine Beast Vah Naboris roaming the Gerudo Desert. Fegran goes on to explain that the Gerudo chief assures the Town that everything is alright, but the Divine Beast still makes her feel uneasy.
If Link asks about the chief, Fegran explains that Lady Riju became chief after her mother, the previous chief, passed away. Fegran says that Riju inherited the throne because she was their previous chief's only child. Fegran heard that the Town's troubles have been causing Riju and her advisors to worry.
If Link asks about the Divine Beast, Fegran says that Link must have seen it on his way there. She explains that it suddenly appeared a few weeks ago and that it strikes lightning at those who come near it. Fegran also recounts a story that Naboris was once a god who protected the Gerudo Desert 100 years ago, but she is not sure whether to believe the story or not. Before finishing speaking, Fegran warns Link not to get too close to the Divine Beast Vah Naboris.
After Link calms Naboris, Fegran will say that she is relieved that the Divine Beast is calmed, but she is still worried that it will start stomping around again.
