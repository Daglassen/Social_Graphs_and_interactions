He is a light brown anthropomorphic wildcat wearing a cowboy outfit. He is voiced by Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\n==Background==\nThe Milk Bandit makes his first appearance in the episode, \"[[The Pie Thief]]\". After [[Sheriff Callie]] and [[Deputy Peck]] head out of town due to a fib made by [[Priscilla Skunk]], the bandit enters [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] to steal all the town's milk. The Bandit ends up running into Priscilla, who believes he is just a visitor. After showing him the way to [[Ella Cowbelle]]'s milk saloon, the Bandit sets his plan in motion. Priscilla tries to find Callie and Peck, only to find they still aren't there since they're chasing the pie thief she made up. Trying to think of a way to keep the Milk Bandit at bay, Priscilla resorts to using the pies from the contest. Once the Bandit has tied up the townsfolk with yarn and is about to make off with the pilfered dairy products, Priscilla emerges with the pies in hand. She convinces the Bandit to try out the pies until Callie and Peck return (and confesses to the townsfolk about making up the pie thief story). By the third pie, however, the Bandit finds himself with a stomachache and sets off with the milk. At that point, however, Callie and Peck return and spot the Milk Bandit getting away. Callie captures the Bandit with her lasso and sends him flying into the air, and also manages to stop the now riderless wagon. Deputy Peck then proceeds to jail the Milk Bandit, who landed in the leftover pies.\n\nThe Bandit later returns in the episode, \"[[Lost Popcorn Cavern]]\", where he poses as a prospector and manipulates the townsfolk into digging a hole into [[Farmer Stinky]]'s milk cellar so he can swipe the barrels of milk. Once the townsfolk reach the stash of milk barrels and load them onto the Bandit's wagon, the Bandit seals them inside and reveals his identity. The Bandit then attempts to make his getaway, but Callie manages to catch up with him along the edge of a chasm. The wagon runs over a rock, causing the milk barrels to fall off the wagon. The Bandit manages to grab the last barrel but ends up going over the edge. Callie lassoes him and saves his life. After Farmer Stinky's milk barrels are returned, Callie arrests the Bandit and puts him in jail where there's nothing to drink except water.\n\nThe Bandit appears yet again in the episode, \"[[Tunnel of Trouble]]\", during the annual Milk Day festival. The Bandit digs a hole leading in and out of the jail cell and conceals both ends. He then steps out into the open and allows Callie to jail him. Once Callie is away, the Bandit slips through the tunnel and then proceeds to set his plot in motion, singing a [[I'm Gonna Get Me Some Milk|sneaky song]] while doing so. He finally empties all the milk into a balloon and loads it onto his escape wagon. After that, the Bandit sneaks back inside the jail cell before anyone notices him missing. However, Callie spots a trail of milk leading to the back of the jail cell and discovers the tunnel. She enters the tunnel, hoping to figure out where it takes her. The Bandit then emerges, and plugs the tunnel with a barrel, trapping Callie underground while he takes off. With no other way to go, Callie follows the tunnel and catches onto the Bandit's plot. After Peck takes Callie out of the cell, the two chase after the Bandit. The Bandit spots the sheriff and the deputy pursuing him and tries to shake them. The wagon hits a rock, launching the Bandit and the balloon full of milk into the air. Callie manages to save the milk balloon from getting popped by a field of cacti and then lassoes the Bandit. When the Bandit ends up back in the jail cell, he finds out that his tunnel has been sealed by a set of metal bars.\n\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Milk Bandit, The}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Bandits]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
