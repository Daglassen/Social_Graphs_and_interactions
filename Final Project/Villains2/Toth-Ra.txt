Based on scriptures, he appeared benevolent to his people by rewarding them with the sun's light; even after his death, the society he built continued life underground and modeled themselves after mummies in honor of Toth-Ra. A prophecy spoke that one day Toth-Ra would rise again, thus his followers remained within the pyramids; his personal guard however worried that they would lose hope, so they constructed a contraption to puppeteer Toth-Ra's body making Toth-Ra appear immortal and extend his rule.\n\n==Role in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|series]]==\nToth-Ra was the subject of the Season 1 episode \"[[The Living Mummies of Toth-Ra!]]\", where his personal guard's descendant [[Sabaf]] was in charge of using Toth-Ra in present day, controlling the other followers by bestowing them the rays of the sun temporarily. The conspiracy ends up uncovered by [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Louie]] while [[Scrooge McDuck]] and the other McDucks lead the servants to revolt. However, when Louie uses the puppet contraption, Toth-Ra's body falls to the ground and beyond the heart of his chamber; this activates the curse and revives Toth-Ra as a mindless undead mummy.\n\nDespite his former followers' attempts to fight, they fail to stop Toth-Ra who sees Louie wearing his treasure. Chasing Louie out of the pyramid, he corners the young duck. Louie surrenders and tries to atone his crime to a Toth-Ra, however Toth-Ra only desires him to die for his actions. Just then, Webby uses the light to blind Toth-Ra while Scrooge trips him; together, the followers catch Toth-Ra in a blanket, wrap him up and pass him back to his throne. When placed back in his chambers, the curse is waived and Toth-Ra's spirit is released.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Toth-Ra is featured as one of the monsters in the show's [[DuckTales Theme|intro]].\n**Additionally, a CGI version of Toth-Ra was featured in Glomgold's version of the ''DuckTales'' theme song as part of the Theme Song Takeover series, where a CGI version of [[Flintheart Glomgold|Glomgold]] punches him, causing the head of Toth-Ra to fly off during the verse \"C-C-C-CG, it's so fancy\". This was also seen in the intro of the Season 2 episode, \"[[GlomTales!]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nS01 Intro Toth-Ra 1.jpg|Toth-Ra in the show's opening\nS01 Intro Toth-Ra 2.jpg|Toth-Ra chasing Scrooge McDuck's gang in the show's opening\nDuckTales Toth-Ra.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Charactes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Falcons]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Mythology]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
