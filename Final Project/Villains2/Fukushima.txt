He was a student at the [[Yamanouchi Ninja School]] and [[Master Sensei]]. He betrayed them when he allied himself with [[Monkey Fist]], whom he told the location of the [[Lotus Blade]].\n\nHe had this rivalry with [[Ron Stoppable]], who was an exchange student at the Yamanouchi Ninja School, frequently calling Ron \"Outsider\".\n\nWhen he allied himself with Monkey Fist, they were able to steal the Lotus Blade and capture [[Yori (Kim Possible)|Yori]]. After Yori was captured, Fukushima agreed to help Ron in rescuing her, but it was a trap, which he was purposely leading Ron into. Ron then defeated Fukushima by tapping into and channeling his own Mystical Monkey Power for the first time.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n260204.jpg\nFuku.png\nvlcsnap-2015-06-04-23h10m20s162.png|Fukushima's defeat.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ninjas]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
