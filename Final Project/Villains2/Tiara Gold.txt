She acts as [[Sharpay Evans]] assistant during Sharpay's senior year at school. She is portrayed by Jemma Mckenzie-Brown.\n\n==Role in the film==\nShe is a foreign exchange student from [[London]] who goes to\u00a0[[East High School|East High]]\u00a0where she meets\u00a0[[Sharpay Evans]]. Tiara asks Sharpay if she could be her assistant (after Sharpay put posters everywhere). Tiara proves to be hardworking by memorizing Sharpay's entire class schedule, and organizing her books for her. Sharpay hires her, and tells her to throw away all of her orange clothes to prevent clashing outfits.\n\nShe shows interest in musical theater but initially tries not to upstage Sharpay. Later on in the movie, she is made Sharpay's understudy. [[Jimmy Zara|Jimmie]], who is chosen as Troy's understudy hits on her. Tiara coldly declines.\n\nTiara overhears [[Gabriella Montez|Gabriella]] telling Taylor about her going to college early and tells Sharpay. After being humiliated in the stage Sharpay arrives to see that Tiara was wearing her costume. Tiara then tells her that she is from London School of Dramatic Arts and that next year it will be her drama department and that she was just acting all along. When Tiara begins performing \"[[A Night to Remember]]\", Sharpay crashes her performance.\u00a0[[Ms. Darbus]]\u00a0later announces that next year Sharpay will be helping in the drama department and Tiara angrily smirks.\n\nIn the deleted scenes, it is revealed that after Sharpay graduated, her locker was Tiara's. The locker was the same, with the exception that the locker had the British flag on it instead of Sharpay's pink one.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gold, Tiara}}\n\n{{High School Musical}}\n[[Category:High School Musical characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Actors]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
