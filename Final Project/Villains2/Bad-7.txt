Unlike the Ultraheroes, these villains are not the alter egos of their original selves and are actually who their name states, with the exception of Rockerduck who takes the name and identity Roller Dollar.\n\n==Formation==\nThey were assembled by [[Emil Eagle]] to find and retrieve the Ultrapods, which can be combined to create the Ultramachine, a super-powerful weapon that can give its owner enough power to take over the world.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Emil Eagle]]\n*[[Inquinator]]\n*[[Pete]]\n*[[Phantom Blot]]\n*[[John D.
