Frost Taluses are recurring Enemies and Sub-Bosses in the The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Frost Taluses are icy variants of Stone Taluses. They can be found in cold, snowy areas throughout the Hebra and Gerudo Regions. They are coated in ice and will freeze Link upon contact, making it impossible for Link to climb them normally. Link can climb a Frost Talus with the upgraded Snowquill Set or Zant's Helmet for the Unfreezable Set Bonus, or by melting its frozen coating with Fire Arrows before attempting to climb it. The rock chunks that they launch at Link will always be coated in ice.
Link can defeat a Frost Talus the same way as every other variant of Talus, inflicting damage to their Ore Deposits through melee attacks, firing Arrows, or by using Urbosa's Fury.
By defeating all Taluses in Hyrule Kingdom, including Frost Taluses, Link will receive the Medal of Honor: Talus from Kilton. However, this can only be done after defeating Calamity Ganon.
