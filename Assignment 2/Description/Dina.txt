The two teachers are twins named Tina and Dina.|Figurine|TMC}}</ref> Throughout the game, she stands in front of the {{Term|TMC|Funday School|display=School}} and will not let {{Term|TMC|Link|link}} through,<ref>{{Cite|Well, if it isn\u2019t {{Color|TMC Green|Link}}! It IS good to see you again.

We are studying Hyrulean Literature right now. It\u2019s a very important subject!|Dina|TMC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|We\u2019re studying math right now, but once we\u2019re done, that\u2019s it for the day!|Dina|TMC}}</ref>\n\nAfter {{Term|TMC|Link}} obtains the {{Term|TMC|Water Element|link}} from the {{Term|TMC|Temple of Droplets|link}} and sees the spirit of {{Term|TMC|Gustaf|link}} for the first time, {{Term|TMC|Funday School}} lets the children out for recess and the building becomes accessible.<ref>{{Cite|Recess is almost over...|Dina|TMC}}</ref>\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\nDina is a young {{Term|BotW|Gerudo|link}} who attends {{Term|BotW|Ashai|link|display=Ashai's}} classes in {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Town|link}} in {{BotW}}. She considers all the learning she does to be a pain in a neck but asks {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} not tell anyone she said so.<ref>{{Cite|It's about time for Ms. Ashai's class to begin. To be honest...I think learning all this is a real pain in the neck. But don't tell anyone I said that!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> One her way to the {{Term|BotW|Cooking|link}} class, she insists that she needs to pay attention this time.<ref>{{Cite|The cooking class is about to start. I really need to pay attention this time...|Dina|BotW}}</ref> She asks Link to try taking it with them.<ref>{{Cite|How about you try taking it along with us?|Dina|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Dina in the classroom in the barracks before or during Ashai's relationship class begins, she asks Link for his opinion of her lipstick.<ref>{{Cite|What do you think of my lipstick? I think it'll bring me good luck!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Dina then explains that the color of lipstick is important in bringing good luck.<ref>{{Cite|You know that the color is especially important in bringing good luck, right?|Dina|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks how the color affects luck, Dina stutters nervously and says that she is learning that next.<ref>{{Cite|Umm... I-I'm planning on learning about that next...|Dina|BotW}}</ref> If Link says it looks good on her, Dina exclaims that she can feel the lipstick working already.<ref>{{Cite|I know, right?! Oooh, I can feel it working already!|Dina|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring the relationship class, Ashai asks the class what to do when a \"handsome voe\" approaches them on the street.<ref>{{Cite|Now then... You're walking down the street on your way somewhere, and a handsome voe you've never met approaches...|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Dina is the second to stand up and share her solution, saying that she would enthusiastically greet the man and approach with her hands empty.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would enthusiastically greet him, approaching with a smile and with my hands clearly empty!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Ashai praises Dina for her optimistic approach,<ref>{{Cite|Wow, Dina, that's a very optimistic approach to take!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> adding that friendliness is a great way to relax others.<ref>{{Cite|Being overtly friendly is an excellent way to put the stranger's mind at ease!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nNext, Ashai asks her class what they would do if they found an injured man lying on the ground.<ref>{{Cite|In your travels, you come upon an injured voe lying on the ground. What do you do?|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Once again, Dina stands second, claiming she would make a medicine to treat him with.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would determine what was the matter and make a medicine on the spot to treat him!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Ashai considers this a great answer, though she reminds her to check for allergies.<ref>{{Cite|Great answer, Dina! Just be careful that the voe doesn't have some sort of allergy to the ingredients in your medicine!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAshai's final scenario for her class is what they would do if they're approached by a man whose attention they've sought.<ref>{{Cite|You are suddenly approached by a voe whose attention you've sought, and he abruptly engages you in conversation.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Dina states she would try to determine his social standing based on his clothing.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would take the up-close opportunity to determine his social standing based on the clothes he's wearing!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Ashai thinks this is a good idea but reminds her that people may wear more casual clothes if their good ones are dirty.<ref>{{Cite|Ah, good thinking, Dina. Just remember that sometimes all of someone's good clothes are dirty, so they might wear something more casual.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Dina while she is attending Ashai's cooking class at night, she complains that she is only able to cook [[Dubious Food]].<ref>{{Cite|Sav'saaba! This class is absolutely critical for me! I've tried to cook up some great meals, but I only ever make {{Color|BotW Blue|dubious food}}...|Dina|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks her about Dubious Food, she explains that adding insects or monster parts to a meal causes it to become Dubious Food.<ref>{{Cite|When you're cooking, if you add {{Color|BotW Blue|insects}} or {{Color|BotW Blue|monster materials}}, you'll end up with {{Color|BotW Blue|dubious food}}.|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Dina feels that there is nothing dubious about how inedible Dubious Food is.<ref>{{Cite|Though if you ask me, there's nothing dubious about how absolutely inedible it is...|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Dina says that the quickest way to someone's heart is through their stomach.<ref>{{Cite|The quickest way to someone's heart is through their stomach! At least, that's what the teacher says...|Dina|BotW}}</ref> If {{Term|BotW|Link}} attempts to read {{Term|BotW|Chef Aurie Taamu, Vol. 2|link}} while {{Term|BotW|Dina}} is at the class, she will notice that the book is too high up for him to read and offer to read it for him.<ref>{{Cite|That book was written by an amazing chef, Aurie Taamu. {{Small|Just between us...
