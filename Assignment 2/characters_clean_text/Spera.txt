Spera is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Spera is a Gerudo who manages a General Store in Gerudo Town. Her store sells Cooking ingredients, including Rock Salt, Tabantha Wheat and Hylian Rice.
Like many of the vendors in Gerudo Town, Spera is married to a man who lives outside of the town's walls and returns to the town in order to sell her wares. She and her husband are newlywed and seem to be close despite how little they see each other, with the two of them agreeing that voe from other places are tiny, and that the best meals are made with the best ingredients. While Spera runs the store her husband supplies the stock and does all the Cooking.
If Link speaks to Spera, she will make different remarks depending on the time of day. In the morning, she asks him if he has already eaten and wonders if people who are not Gerudo eat enough due to their small size. In the afternoon, she mentions her and her husband's views on fresh ingredients, and at night she will tell him that Gerudo Town never sleeps and that as a result her store is always open, meaning that she often cannot go home to her husband. Regardless of the time of day Spera will end their conversation by explaining that although they can get by with less sleep than most people, given how dangerous the desert can be it is important for Link to rest when he is tired. Spera will also apologise to Link that her shop does not samples of the ingredients, but guarantees that he will like the flavor. If Link buys all her stock she will give him thanks from both her and her husband.
