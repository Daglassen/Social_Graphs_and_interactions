A member of Jadis' Secret Police, it is possible that he was [[Maugrim]]'s second-in-command and may have become ranked as captain.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAs the Pevensies arrive at the Beavers' Dam, Vardan and the rest of Maugrim's pack arrived at the spot where the Pevensies are at just as Vardan and the wolf pack plan to kill them. Everyone escaped before the wolf packed arrived.\n\nVardan and the wolf pack followed the Pevensies to a waterfall where [[Maugrim]] attacked [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], but ended up being foiled after the ice broke when the season of spring arrived at Narnia during a river flow. Most of the wolves part of Maugrim's pack either died or were separated from Maugrim where the surviving wolves returned to Jadis.\n\nMaugrim and Vardan continued following the children to Aslan's Camp as they prepared to attack [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]], but the assault was prevented when [[Aslan]] arrived to stop the fight. Peter arrived and both of the wolves attacked, but Aslan stopped Vardan during Peter's first fight against Maugrim. After Maugrim's death, Vardan runs away with the surviving wolves who report to Jadis, unknowingly leading [[Oreius]] and his centaur soldiers to Jadis' camp where they saved Edmund in danger.\n\nWhat happened to Vardan's fate in the final version of the film was unknown, whether or not he died being killed by Oreius and his henchmen or fought alongside Jadis during the final battle. Whether he survived or not during the battle is also unknown.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The name \"Vardan\" was only used for the end credits of the Disney/Walden Media adaptation of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and in the size comparison chart of Jadis' Army.\n*Vardan is likely inspired by a singular wolf that noticed Maugrim dead at the hands of Peter. After it told the White Witch of what happened to Maugrim, the lone wolf was summoned to bring in her army of evil creatures to meet with her.\n*Though his fate in the final version of the film is unknown, the answer to Vardan's fate was only in an early screenplay of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' where the wolf was wounded during the rescue of Edmund as Jadis runs him through with a sword.\n\n{{The Chronicles of Narnia}}\n\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
