"[[File:Mary_Ann_01.jpg|thumb]]'''Mary Ann''' is a Tarantula Girl who came to the light side to destroy King Boz before his coronation. \u00a0She later attempted to obtain the Bat Medallion from the Kings. She speaks human language. Mary Ann uses her beauty and flirtatious personality to cause problems for Boz and Boomer, but she\u2019s also a cunning warrior and a dangerous enemy. Even Mikayla, one of the toughest and strongest girls in the world, was briefly trapped and held prisoner by her. She\u2019s also known for hungrily devouring entire animals, either living or dead.\n\n==History==\nShe was given [[Brady Parker|Brady]]'s King Ring by her father, the Tarantula Shaman. She then went to the light side looking like a beautiful girl, but Boomer kept Boz from going near her because the 10th Bromandment was to never let a girl come between them. Mary Ann then got Boomer to hug her and Lanny let Boz see it which caused them to fight in the coronation and Boz revealed Boomer's ballet secret.\n\nAfterwards, Mary Ann lured Boomer to a waterfall and ambushed him with an army of Tarantula People. She threw Brady's King Ring off the cliff, but Boz saved him and Boomer defeated the Tarantula People with his ballet skills. Mary Ann then left, telling Boomer he won this one.\n\nMary Ann later returned to track down the Bat Medallion. \u00a0She and two of her best warriors followed Boz, Boomer, and Mikayla to Chicago when they went to meet Rebecca's father. \u00a0Mary Ann and her men captured Mikayla and tried to force Boomer to hand over the medallion. \u00a0Fortunately, Mikayla escaped and Mr. Dawson used Tarantula powder as a former Tarantula shaman to defeat Mary Ann by turning her into a Tarantula. It is unknown what has become of her since she is last seen being put into a pot in Tarantula form.\n\n==Trivia==\n\nMary Ann has the ability to change her hairstyle instantly, from straight to crazy and vice versa, although this is a normal Tarantula girl power.\n\nShe can also eat whole animals in minutes or possibly seconds, leaving only bones. She claims that the brain is her favorite part.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ann Mary}}\n[[Category:Pair of Kings characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
