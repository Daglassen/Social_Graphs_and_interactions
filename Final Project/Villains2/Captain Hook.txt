He is a bloodthirsty pirate that commands ''[[The Jolly Roger]]''. Hook has long since abandoned sailing the high seas in favor of having revenge on [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] for cutting off his left hand and feeding it to a [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]], who has since been in constant pursuit of the captain. While a worthy opponent for Peter, Hook is destined to fail\u2014sometimes because of Peter Pan's ability to fly, but more often through the bumbling incompetence of his first mate, [[Mr. Smee]].\n\nHook's frustrations are understandable; he lost a hand to his opponent, is constantly pursued by the crocodile, and is unable to fly. These factors arguably make him one of the most sympathetic Disney villains. His antics with the crocodile are considered by many to be the funniest animated scenes ever created by Disney, according to [[Frank Thomas]] and [[Ollie Johnston]] in the book ''The Disney Villain''. \n\nAs one of the most recognizable and popular villains in Disney's animated library, Captain Hook is also a primary member of the [[Disney Villains]] franchise.\n\n==Background==\n''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]'' reveals that Hook had a rather miserable childhood. As a young buccaneer, he was trained in the ways of piracy by his mother, [[Mama Hook]], though he was pitiful at the craft. It was also revealed that James was heavily ostracized as a child, with his birthdays being particularly lonesome. Despite his negative upbringing, James saw occasional joy in the form of his stuffed bear (which he dubbed \"Captain Cuddly Bear\u201d), his prized trumpet, and his childhood babysitter, [[Nanny Nell]].\n\nIn ''The Pirate Fairy'', James mentions that he was educated at Eton College in [[England]]. The film also revealed that James once commanded a diverse crew, who were bent on sailing to various regions of the world to plunder national landmarks and wealthy cities. During an escapade involving the attempted theft of [[Pixie Hollow]]\u2019s blue [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]], James lost his crew and became stranded at sea, just off the shores of [[Neverland]]. He would eventually be rescued by a kindly man named Mr. Smee.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Smee, James came into the possession of ''[[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]]'', of which he would command as captain with Mr. Smee as his first mate. With a [[Pirate Crew (Peter Pan)|new crew]] at his disposal, James would plunder and pillage the seas with pride. He would eventually cross paths with [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]], a young boy from Neverland with the [[Pixie Dust|ability to fly]]. As a \"childish prank\", Peter cut off James's left hand and fed it to an enormous [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]]. James would replace his lost hand with an iron hook, but the crocodile enjoyed the taste of the captain so well that it followed the ''Jolly Roger'' ever since, hoping to devour the rest of James. Infuriated by the loss of his hand and the ongoing threat of the crocodile, a vengeful James\u2014now known as \u201cCaptain Hook\u201d\u2014vowed to never leave Neverland's shores until he has killed Peter Pan.\n\n===Development===\n{{Quote|Maybe with the crocodile and Hook - the crocodile is waiting for him - then have a funny chase - the last you see is Hook going like hell. That's better than having him get caught... the audience will get to liking Hook and they won't want to see him killed.|[[Walt Disney]] in a story meeting}}\nAt the beginning of the story development stage for ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'', the story department wrote an analysis of Captain Hook for the film, suggesting that he be a fop, but mean to the point of being murderous; one of the directors, however, imagined him as a ''complete heavy'', considering any foppish traits to distract the audience from his villainy. The character was only completely pinpointed long into the animation stage, as it proved difficult to create a menacing villain whose character would not be diminished by the scenes with the Crocodile. Eventually, the character settled on was a black-hearted man who tried to put on airs and pretended to be a gentleman of good taste and style. It was realized that Hook would become likable to the audience, and as a consequence, it was decided that the character should not be killed in the film.\n\n===Personality===\nCaptain Hook is emotionally vulnerable. Due to this, he has made a fool of himself quite often. On the contrary, he typically acts as a menacing and cunning villain who never gives up on his pursuits particularly his desire to get revenge on Peter Pan. He is also a murderous character, almost to an extreme extent, as at one point in the film, he callously shot and killed one of his crew members because of his annoying singing. Later in the film, he viciously threw one of his pirates overboard using only his hook. While comically and occasionally bumbling, Hook is a force to be reckoned with, both physically and mentally. With his temper extremely fragile, those around him are often at risk, with Peter Pan being the only individual truly skilled enough to take on the villainous captain.\n\nHook is extremely intelligent and manipulative and aided by his charming and suave personality. He is able to trick anyone even those who are more than aware that he is not to be trusted. Captain Hook also seems to have a tendency to find loopholes in agreements or contracts, or show obedience to the letter of the law, rather than the spirit of the law. For instance, when Hook was made to promise that he would not lay a finger or a hook on Peter Pan, he agreed, but instead he planted a bomb disguised as a present in Peter's hideout.\n\nCaptain Hook is one of few villains that view their sidekick as not only a minion but as a friend. While Hook is incredibly cruel, deadly, short-tempered, and shows no care for his crew, he seems to only tolerate the bumbling actions of Mr. Smee. It has been shown that Hook murders his crew members out of irritation and aggravation, but despite the constant annoyance from Smee, Hook has never shown any desire to kill him (though he has attempted to pummel Smee for his stupidity, but he is always interrupted). Aside from this, Captain Hook also views Smee as his confidant, sharing personal thoughts with Smee as well being the first person he turns to when scared which is not common for a villain of Hook's acclaim.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nCaptain Hook is a thin man with long black hair, a large hooked nose, a thin black handlebar mustache that angles upward sharply, and a large chin. He is usually clean-shaven, but sometimes (even in the same movie) he sports a stubble beard which makes his chin look gray. He wears a frilly white cravat underneath a red coat with gold lining and red cuffs. Each of these cuffs sports two gold cufflinks. Beneath his coat, it was a pink turtleneck with white frills in each sleeves. He also wears an orange sash over his right shoulder that holds his sword scabbard at his left hip. He wears rose pants and white knee-high socks, as well as black boots with a pink circle decorating each one. The tongues of his boots are enormous, reaching halfway up his shins. He wears a large crimson hat with a huge lavender feather stuck in it. He carries a rapier with a gold hilt and guard as a weapon. He has a hook on his left-hand, made of silver or gold depending on the occasion.\n\nIt is rumored that Captain Hook's appearance is based on that of his animator, [[Frank Thomas]]. The actor [[Hans Conried]] not only provided Hook's gravelly voice but also performed extensive live-action reference for the character. [[Kathryn Beaumont]], who voiced and performed live-action reference for Wendy Darling, enjoyed working with him, admiring his ability to be both comical and marvelously evil at the same time. Also, Hook's climatic scenes with the Crocodile were animated by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] in ''Peter Pan''. Conried was later asked to do the same kind of work as [[King Stefan]] in ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', but he did not get the choice in voicing Stefan because the late [[Taylor Holmes]] was given the choice for the voice role instead, possibly resulting in the voice mystery of the [[The Duke|herald]].\n\nWhen he was nearly eaten by either a crocodile or an octopus in both movies, Hook's outfit is always in shreds and sometimes losing one of his boots and his pants or being barefoot.\n\nIn ''Return to Neverland'', Hook's appearance remains largely the same, but only his pink turtleneck underneath became brighter in coloration. When he was given a foot massage by Smee, he was seen wearing a classic sleeping attire which is a light green jumpsuit.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Swordsmanship:''' Captain Hook is a skilled swordsman, rivaled only by Peter Pan. He is light on his feet and stealthy, making him a dangerous adversary. The use of his hook during duels tends to give him an occasional upper hand, as well.\n*'''Fluency in Fairy Language:''' Hook is one of the few characters to exhibit the ability to understand and speak to fairies. In ''Peter Pan'', he was able to communicate directly with [[Tinker Bell]], while in ''The Pirate Fairy'', he is seen conversing with [[Zarina]] as though she were speaking English, and translating for the rest of his crew.\n*'''Flight:''' James briefly harnessed the power of pixie dust in ''The Pirate Fairy'', allowing him to soar through the air. Though rocky at first, he got the hang of it fairly quickly, even being able to sword fight while in midair.\n*'''Super Strength:''' Despite his thin build, James appears to possess incredible physical strength, demonstrated when he lifts Smee and holds him upside down solely with his hook, and when he uses one arm to throw Mr. Starkey overboard.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''===\n[[File:Captain-hook1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Captain Hook in the original ''Peter Pan''.]]\nIn the original film, Hook plays the main antagonist and is first seen on his ship, ''[[The Jolly Roger]]'', trying to find the hiding spot of Peter Pan using a map. Hook suddenly gets the idea to kidnap the Indian [[Tiger Lily|Princess Tiger Lily]] and tells the idea to his faithful first mate, [[Mr. Smee]]. He plans to force her into revealing the location of Peter's hideout or be killed. While Hook is trying to concentrate on his scheme, he becomes annoyed when one of his crew members starts singing. Mr. Smee points out that what he did was not good form, Hook lashes out at him, reminding him of how Peter Pan cutting off his hand and throwing it to the crocodile wasn't \"good form\". Just then, Hook hears the sound of a ticking clock, causing his eyes and mustache to twitch in rhythm (with the music of \"[[Never Smile at a Crocodile]]\"). When he turns to see that the [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]], who had eaten his hand, has come to taste more of him, he begs Smee to get rid of the creature, which Smee does. A little moment later, Hook receives a word from a pirate on a lookout that Peter is on approach. He orders Smee to rally up the pirates, then looks through the telescope to see Peter and three others, the Darling children, in company of him standing on the clouds. He and the pirates then set up the cannon and fire cannonballs up at Peter Pan.\n\nLater, Captain Hook and Smee are seen rowing past [[Mermaid Lagoon (Neverland)|the Mermaid Lagoon]] in a rowboat with a captive Tiger Lily, whom they take to [[Skull Rock]]. Unbeknownst to Hook, Peter Pan spots them and follows them to the cave, plotting to rescue Tiger Lily. Hook also doesn't notice that the crocodile who had stalked him earlier is following him. As Captain Hook forced Tiger Lily to reveal Peter's secret hideout to the point of shouting directly to her face, Peter spooks Hook by imitating a spirit. Captain Hook goes on an investigation to find out where the strange voice (Peter's imitation of Hook) is coming from.\n\nHe finds Peter on the rocks and is about to lay his hook on him, but thanks to Wendy's warning, the captain's hook only catches Peter's hat as Peter slips away. Captain Hook engages Peter in a duel, eventually pushing him off the cliff's ledge. Upon realizing that he is standing on thin air, he struggles to keep himself from falling and manages to hang onto the ledge with his hook. Just then, Captain Hook hears the sound of a ticking clock, causing his eyes and mustache to twitch in rhythm (with the music of \"Never Smile at a Crocodile\") again; the crocodile arrives and attempts to eat Hook as it pulls him into the water. Captain Hook escapes from the crocodile's jaws and frantically swims back to his ship with the crocodile in hot pursuit.\n\n[[File:Peterpan-disneyscreencaps-6985.jpg|thumb|250px|Captain Hook sings \"[[The Elegant Captain Hook]]\".]]\nBack at the ''Jolly Roger'', Hook sits in his room, sick and injured from the previous battle with Peter. He is bothered by Smee hammering up a sign asking to not disturb the captain. But when Hook tries to attack Smee, he is accidentally smacked on the head with the hammer, causing him to briefly lose consciousness. When Hook gets a visit from Smee, Smee tells Hook that Pan has banished Tinker Bell. This shocking news gives Hook an idea, so he orders Smee to capture her. He does so and Hook uses her jealousy of Wendy to his advantage (whom she thinks Peter is in love with) to get to Peter's hideout. As Captain Hook thanks Tinker Bell for her help, he locks her in a lantern, then he, along with Smee and the pirates, goes to [[Hangman's Tree]] to capture Wendy, [[Michael Darling|Michael]], [[John Darling|John]] and [[Lost Boys|The Lost Boys]]. As the pirates take them to the ship, Captain Hook and Mr. Smee set a time bomb (disguised as a gift of love from Wendy) in the hideout, since Peter is still there.\n\nCaptain Hook tries to convince the captured children to join his crew, but they all refuse. Wendy believes Peter will save them but Hook reveals his plan to blast Peter away from Neverland forever, prompting Tinker Bell to struggle to break free from the lantern, which she manages to do so, and flies off to warn Peter. Peter and Tinker Bell are caught in the explosion anyway, but they both quickly recover and leave the destroyed hideout to rescue Wendy and the boys. Just as Hook, who has had sent Wendy off the plank (but she is rescued by Peter), is about to select the next person to follow her, Peter reveals himself and engages Hook in another duel. While dueling on the ship's deck, Peter launches himself from the ship's rope ladder like a slingshot and kicks Hook backwards, sending Hook flying to one of the ship's cannons, which (in a similar fashion to Smee's hammer from earlier) hits him hard on the head, knocking him unconscious.\n\n[[File:Hookchase.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hook fleeing the jaws of the crocodile.]]\nAfter Hook recovers, he climbs up the rope ladder to confront Peter on the mast, calling him a coward for his tendency to fly away from the duel. Hook makes Peter promise not to fly and gains the upper hand by disarming Peter. Hook corners Peter at the edge of the mast and is about to stab him, but Peter, having noticed a ''Jolly Roger'' flag right above Hook, uses it to blind the captain and disarm him. Hook pleads for his life, declaring that he will leave forever and do anything Peter says. Peter orders him to shout that he's a codfish; Hook does so, making Wendy, John, Michael, and the lost boys cheer and sing \"Hook is a codfish\", to which the crocodile dances in the sea. Peter then allows Hook to leave and never return, but when his back is turned, crowing in triumph, Hook sees his chance and is about to lay his hook on Peter in revenge for cutting off his left hand as well as humiliating him. Thanks to Wendy's warning, Peter jumps out of the way, and Captain Hook loses his footing as he falls to the sea, where the crocodile is waiting to catch him. Captain Hook ends up being chased away from Neverland by the crocodile.\n\n===''[[Return to Never Land]]''===\n[[File:Peterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-1915.jpg|thumb|250px|Captain Hook in ''Return to Never Land''.]]\nCaptain Hook plots to murder Peter Pan once again and gain his treasure all at the same time. His first part of the plan is to kidnap Wendy to lure Peter to his doom and thus he travels via his ship (which still had some of Tink's pixie dust) to [[London]] during the Second World War. Likely having lost the concept of the passage of time/aging due to his time in Neverland, he mistakenly takes Wendy's daughter, [[Jane (Peter Pan)|Jane]].\n\nFortunately for Hook, Pan arrives and Hook summons an undersea giant [[Octopus (Peter Pan)|octopus]] to kill both Peter and \"Wendy\". Peter dives down to battle and is seemingly killed. Just as Hook begins to celebrate, Peter reveals to be alive and by using pixie dust, Tinker Bell boards the octopus onto Hook's ship. After accidentally swallowing Hook, the Octopus develops a taste and becomes another \"crocodile\" problem for the Captain. The Octopus pulls him out of the ship, into the water, and then accidentally throws him back onto the ship, after which Hook gently asks Smee to fix the broken plank so he can \"make him walk it!\".\n\nLater on during a massage, the Captain is again attacked by the octopus, who is shooed away by Smee. This encounter angers Hook (who laments how he must now deal with the octopus after somehow getting rid of the crocodile) even more to the point where he gathers the pirates to sail to the island to find and kill Peter. While searching, they witness the girl they kidnapped is not Wendy but her daughter Jane and that she is desperate to return home, giving Hook yet another plan. That night, he tricks Jane into working for him; if she can find his treasure, he'll give her a ride home on his ship. He also gives Jane a brass whistle to alert him once the treasure is found. Jane then finds and manipulates Peter and the Lost Boys into assisting her via a game of \"treasure hunt\". Eventually, the treasure is found but she changes her mind, having gradually warmed up to the boys throughout the course of the game, and throws the whistle to summon Hook into the waters. It is however found by Lost Boy [[Lost Boys|Tootles]] who curiously blows it, accidentally calling the pirates. An ambush follows resulting in Peter and the boys being captured and taken to The Jolly Roger, but not before Hook sadistically reveals to Peter Jane's involvement in the boy's capture.\n\nBack in the ship, Captain Hook prepares to watch Pan's death, but he and the pirates are interrupted by Jane and Tinker Bell. A battle follows and in during which Pan is set free. Hook's anger and frustration are targeted for Jane who is the cause of his failure. Just before he is given the chance to murder her, Peter saves the day by cutting the rope in which Hook is holding on to, sending him falling through the ship with his anchor and into the ocean. The anchor hits the octopus on the head, attracting him. The octopus than chases Hook up and through the ship, which is now sinking. In the end, Hook and the pirates are all chased away in their remaining small boat by the octopus.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:Image 0018.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Captain Hook in ''Mickey's House of Villains''.]]\nCaptain Hook regularly made cameo appearances in the animated series ''[[House of Mouse]]''. At the opening of the show, Donald was seen being rather reluctant on shaking Hook's hook at the club's entrance. He was also one of the leading villains in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', where he was [[Jafar]]'s second-in-command. Hook was also one of the few villains to appear in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'', where he was seen with Jafar and [[Hades]] during the [[The Best Christmas of All|finale song]].\n\nIn \"[[Dining Goofy]]\", Goofy innocently told Hook about Donald's constant jokes centering the captain, putting Donald in an awkward position.\n\nIn the episode \"[[House of Genius]]\", Hook was shown to get very frustrated upon hearing Goofy say the word \"Pan\".\n\nIn \"[[Pluto vs. Figaro]]\", Hook mistakenly thought he and his crew were under attack and fired a cannon into the kitchen, landing in Goofy's mouth.\n\nIn \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\", Hook assisted Mickey and friends in an attempt to prove that [[Ludwig Von Drake]] cannot know everything. In that same episode, Hook was seen alongside Smee during [[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|the headcount of all the guests]].\n\n===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===\n{{Quote|[[Captain Hook is a Cranky Crook]]|The theme song for Captain Hook in the series|Jake and the Never Land Pirates}}\n[[File:Screen-shot-2012-10-06-at-12-25-03-pm.png|thumb|250px|Captain Hook as he appears in ''Jake and the Never Land Pirates''.]]\nIn this Disney Junior series, Captain Hook is the primary antagonist. After Peter and Tinker Bell left Neverland for outside adventure, Hook stayed behind in hopes of dominating Neverland in Peter's absence. To keep Hook at bay, Peter left a young crew of pirates behind as Neverland\u2019s guardians and protectors. Hook's crew is greatly downsized, consisting only of himself, Smee, and two new pirate musicians known as [[Sharky and Bones]].\n\nAs mentioned, Hook's main objective throughout the series is to collect as much treasure as possible, even if it means stealing it from someone else. To achieve this goal, Hook often uses one (or more) of his special [[Captain Hook's Hooks (object)|hooks]], created for treasure hunting. Some of the hooks include a propeller hook to give the captain flight, a plunger hook to grasp treasure, and even a butterfly net hook. Hook's mother, known as [[Mama Hook]], made a special appearance in the series, later becoming a recurring character. The episode \"[[Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty]]\" introduced [[Red Jessica]], a swashbuckling pirate gal with whom Captain Hook fell in love, though she is apparently unaware of his affections (until he helped her find a heart-shaped treasure in the episode \"Hooked\"). Whenever something goes wrong, Hook would exclaim \"Blast!\"\n\nIn the episode ''[[Mama Hook Knows Best!|Mama Hook Knows Best]]!,'' it's revealed that Captain Hook's full name is Captain James Bartholemew Hook.\n\nThroughout the series, it is also revealed that Captain Hook is rather infamous throughout the seven seas (harking back to the lyrics in his trademark song, ''[[The Elegant Captain Hook]]''). Several guest characters tend to have some history with Hook, typically of the negative variety. Various other pirate characters such as the daring [[Captain Flynn]] and the regal [[Pirate Princess]] all have shown to have a hatred for Hook proceeding their respective debut episodes. Interestingly enough, Hook himself never seems to recognize them. Hook is also given a rival villain known as [[Beatrice Le Beak]], a French pirate gal who plunders and pillages citizens of the NeverSea, including villainous pirates such as Hook.\n\nDespite being villainous, Hook is often shown as a supporting character in subsequent episodes, a most notable example would be in \"[[Battle for the Book]]\", where Hook helps Jake and his crew rescue the final page in Wendy's storybook.\n\n===''[[The Pirate Fairy]]'' ===\n[[File:James The Pirate Fairy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|James in ''The Pirate Fairy''.]]\nSet some time before the events of ''Peter Pan'', a young Captain Hook, then known as simply James, meets a roguish, talented pixie-dust fairy named [[Zarina]] that ran away from [[Pixie Hollow]], the homeland of Tinker Bell and the fairies of Neverland, and left to live amongst the pirates, befriending James once she does. James, himself, poses as a benevolent lad who appreciates Zarina, unlike the rest of her former friends. Zarina is known to be one of the most intelligent fairies in Pixie Hollow, and despite being a dust-keeper fairy (a fairy who harvests and nurtures fairy dust for other fairies to use) she proves to be an amazing innovator, figuring out ways to make various colors of pixie dust each with its own unique magical properties, such as the powerfully dangerous ability to switch fairy talents, as well as create her very own pixie dust tree, though that trick requires the use of the powerful blue pixie dust. Zarina steals the blue dust and brings it to James and his crew as part of a plan to create their own Pixie Dust Tree, thus giving the pirates an endless supply, enabling them to fly and plunder the Seven Seas to become fabulously rich.\n\n[[File:CaptainJamesPF.jpg|thumb|250px|Captain James after revealing his true colors.]]\nHowever, though she's able to incapacitate most of Pixie Hollow, including the wise [[Queen Clarion]], Tinker Bell and her friends ([[Silvermist]], [[Fawn]], [[Vidia]], [[Iridessa]], and [[Rosetta]]) travel to James' ship and are nearly able to foil Zarina's plot, but the pirate fairy is able to outwit her former friends, and the plan is set back into motion. Eventually, at their Skull Rock home base, a replica of the Pixie Dust Tree is created, and James, as well as his crew, soon find themselves with an endless supply of dust, thus completing the first part of their scheme. With that done, James no longer has any use for Zarina, leading him to double-cross and imprison her in a lantern, revealing himself to be a ruthless villain who only looks out for himself and also the real captain of the pirate crew. With Zarina and her friends captured, James and the crew prepare themselves for the voyage. Tink and the others manage to escape and grab the blue pixie dust, but before they fly out of Skull Rock, James arrives, threatening to drop Zarina into the sea if the fairies don't return the dust; Tink, who still cares about Zarina, hands it over. James soon covers the ship with the golden fairy dust, enabling its flight and setting off to the Second Star to the Right to enter the mainland in order to begin their plundering. He puts Zarina's teardrop-shaped vial full of blue pixie dust around his neck and throws her into the sea anyway, despite his promise to Tink. Tinker Bell and the others save Zarina, reconciling and teaming up with her; they eventually catch up with the ship and challenge James and his crew to battle. James accepts and he and Zarina engage in a duel.\n\n[[File:JamesscreencapSmee.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A washed up James grumpily demands Smee's assistance, foreshadowing the relationship the two will soon share.]]\nAfter a swordfight, the ship falls sideways, causing James' crew to fall overboard into the sea and the pixie dust is released into the ocean. James falls, tries to savor the dust, only to plummet to his apparent death. However, he survives and with the ability to fly, no less. With his new powers and a grappling hook (similar to the one he would eventually wear), he battles Zarina once more, but it again ends in the captain's humiliation. Zarina overuses the dust on James, making him to fly uncontrollably. James then flies into a wave which washes the pixie dust off him and falls into the water. His ship is then stolen by Zarina, Tink, and the others. As James curses the fairies for their heroic efforts, a baby crocodile begins snapping at him, believing he's a codfish, causing him to swim away in fear, leaving his crew behind, although they're amused of their captain's misfortune. Little did James know that baby crocodile would one day grow up to become his nemesis [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile]].\n\nSome time afterward, James finds himself stranded at sea, only to eventually be rescued by a fellow by the name of [[Mr. Smee]], meeting his soon-to-be most trusted assistant for the first time, who compliments his hook, to which James angrily replies by demanding him to rescue him.\n\n===Other appearances===\nHook made a guest cameo at the end of the second episode of ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', in which [[Don Karnage]] was hosting a segment on treasure hunting. When Karnage finds the treasure chest in question, Hook appears and claims it as his own. They then engage in a swordfight, which Hook wins by pinning Karnage to a tree.\n\nHook makes a brief appearance in the animated short ''[[Electric Holiday]]'', watching in the crowd as Cruella De Vil walked down the runaway in a fashion show.\n\nA portrait of Hook can be seen in the [[Evie's Explosion of Taste|first episode]] of the mini-series ''[[Descendants: Wicked World]]''.

Before becoming Captain Hook, he was known as Killian Jones. Originally a guest, Hook soon became one of the show's primary characters. Colin O'Donoghue portrayed Hook from Season 2-6. In Season 7, he portrayed the Wish Realm version of Hook and his cursed counterpart, Rogers.\n\nKillian Jones is a pirate who formerly worked for a King with his brother [[Liam Jones|Liam]]. The two were sent to [[Neverland]] to retrieve the plant [[Dreamshade]]. Killian is reluctant to follow orders after [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] informs them it is poisonous. A stubborn Liam is ultimately killed by the plant, leading Killian to become his own captain of the Jolly Roger. Some time after, he seduces away [[Rumplestiltskin]]'s wife, [[Milah]]. Milah, who was tired of the then cowardly Rumple's persona, gladly left both the feeble peasant and her son behind in order to live a life with Jones. After becoming the master of black [[magic]], Rumple confronts Killian and Milah; killing the latter and removing the hand of Jones as revenge. which he replaces with a hook, thus receiving his alias as Captain Hook. He once again travels to Neverland, where he finds and takes care of Rumplestiltskin's son [[Neal Cassidy|Baelfire]] after he is separated from his father Rumplestiltskin. He forms an unlikely friendship with him, until Bae learns that Hook took Milah from his father. He hands Bae over to the [[Lost Boys]] who take him to Peter Pan. Returning from Neverland, Hook is enlisted by the [[The Evil Queen|Evil Queen Regina]] to dispose of her mother [[Queen of Hearts|Cora]] in [[Wonderland]], though Hook and Cora form an alliance. When the Dark Curse is activated, Cora protects them both and part of the [[Enchanted Forest]] with a barrier spell, frozen in time for 28 years. After this time period, Hook follows [[Emma Swan|Emma]] and [[Snow White|Mary Margaret]] to [[Storybrooke]] with Cora, through a magic bean obtained by Hook. When Mr. Gold (Rumplestiltskin) finds a way to leave Storybrooke without losing his memories, Hook shoots his love [[Belle]], causing her to fall across the town's border and lose her memory again. After Gold travels to Manhattan to locate Baelfire, Hook poisons him, but is captured by Neal Cassidy (Baelfire)'s fianc\u00e9 [[Tamara (Once Upon a Time)|Tamara]], to be used in her and [[Greg Mendell]]'s plot to destroy magic in Storybrooke. He originally leaves Storybrooke with a stolen magic bean for himself, but returns to help Emma, Mary Margaret, [[The Prince|David]], Regina, and Mr. Gold travel to Neverland with his ship, after Henry Mills is transported there. In Neverland, Hook becomes the group's guide for directions as he knows both Neverland and Peter Pan better than anyone. Eventually, they are able to retrieve Henry from the sinister Peter Pan and journey back to Storybrooke, where Pan enacts the original curse again.\n\nHook, along with the other inhabitants, are taken to their original worlds, while Emma and Henry escape to New York City with new memories. A year later, Hook arrives in the city and eventually restores Emma's memories with a potion, returning to Storybrooke with both Emma and Henry to break the new curse by [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West]].\n\nDuring the second and third season, he grows a liking towards the main heroine, Emma Swan, whose strong, feisty, and independent personality catches the captain's eye. This liking eventually becomes a deep, passionate love, and throughout the first few seasons, he is showcased going through great lengths to protect and proclaim his love for Emma, though he was constantly rejected. However, after Hook and Emma are dragged into Zelena's time portal, Emma and Hook officially started a relationship with each other after learning he sacrificed his most valuable possession ([The ''[[the Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]]'') in order to save her, thus Emma finally accepted Hook's affections, and a relationship officially blossomed.\n\nDuring the start of Season 4, Hook's love for Emma would be put to the test after discovering that Gold was still in control of the [[Dark One's Dagger|dagger]] and has not changed. When he threatened to tell Belle and later Emma about using the knife, Gold in turn threatened Hook into doing his bidding by vowing to reveal Hook's dark side again, and later on while attempting to save Emma from Gold's plan to strip her of her powers, loses his heart to Gold, making Hook his puppet to use him to get what he wants. Soon afterwards, Gold tasks Hook with using the [[Sorcerer Hat|Sorcerer's Hat]] to drain the Fairies' magic, in order to kill the cure for the Spell of Shattered Sight, and to obtain enough power to free himself from the Dagger of Kris. Hook reluctantly agrees to the task, since Gold has his heart, and traps the fairies in the hat after Gold convinces Belle to leave Granny's Diner. When Emma and [[Elsa]] later arrive with [[Anna]] and [[Kristoff]], Hook hides behind the counter, leading them to believe that the Fairies had been dealt with by the [[Ingrid|Snow Queen]]. With his job complete, Hook gives the hat to Gold, who tells him to enjoy the last day of his life wherever he wants, because when Gold completes his final preparations by the next morning, he will kill Hook. When the Spell of Shattered Sight was close to engulfing Storybrooke, Hook visits Emma one last time to say goodbye to her, before leaving to chain himself to a dock at the marina. When the Spell of Shattered Sight finally hits, Hook looks on as thunder rumbles and mirror shards rain from the sky. After the Spell of Shattered Sight was ended, Gold tried to kill Hook to free himself from his dagger, only to be stopped by Belle. Emma later restores Hook's heart to his body.\n\nIn Season 5, Emma willingly becomes the Dark One to spare Regina from the burden. Hook is among those who travel to Camelot to find [[Merlin]] so that he can save her. During a fight against [[King Arthur]], Hook is fatally wounded. In order to save his life, Emma uses Dark magic to make him immortal but transforms him into a second Dark One. Hook became furious with what Emma did to him and embraced the Darkness and desired to have his revenge on Gold once again. Hook knew that in order to seek his revenge, he needed to return to Storybrooke and enacted the Dark Curse and in the process killed Merlin. To set things right, Emma erased everyone's memories of what happened in Camelot, including Hook's memories of being turned into a Dark One. She, along with everyone else return to Storybrooke, where Emma tries to cleanse herself and Hook from the Darkness forever, but in secret, as she didn't want to endanger anyone else.\n\nWith his memories erased, Hook desperately tries to get through to Emma and find out exactly what happened in Camelot. However, Emma refused to give answers but instead tried to restart their relationship, stating they could still be together even if she is the Dark One. Hook refused to give into Emma's desires and broke off their relationship as he couldn't be with Emma when she is not herself. Some time later, Hook, David, and Robin Hood went to confront King Arthur over his lies, Hook was nearly attacked by was saved by Emma's sudden appearance. Hook apologized to Emma for breaking off their relationship, stating he does still love her, but again wanted answers and finally Emma revealed to him that the reason why she was doing everything was for him. Taking action, Hook decided it was finally time to know the full story of what happened between them.\n\nHook went off searching for Emma but was unable to find her. It wasn't until he put himself in danger, by jumping off the roof of the Storybrooke Library, did Emma finally reappear to him. Hook assured Emma that whatever she did in Camelot he already forgave her and finally seemed to have convinced her to tell him the truth. However, he was taken prisoner along with Zelena, where Emma finally revealed parts of her plan to destroy Dark magic, by putting it all into Zelena and destroy her along with the Darkness. Hook and Zelena worked together to escape, but Hook stayed behind to search for the squid ink to stop Emma for good. He eventually found the ink and used it on Emma and demanded that she finally tell him the truth. Zelena then reappeared to them, where she agreed with Hook about wanting answers and found a way to get them. Zelena attacked Hook with a knife, but much to his surprised, he was not killed. Zelena then finally gave Hook what he desired, by revealing she had acquired the dreamcatcher that contained his memories from Camelot. Although Emma tried to convince him otherwise, Hook regained his memories. Having finally learned the truth and feeling utterly betrayed that Emma did that to him, Hook once again embraced the Darkness.\n\nSeeking revenge in everything that had happened, Hook had resurrected [[Nimue (character)|Nimue]] and all the previous Dark Ones and attempted to send Emma and her family to the Underworld. However, at the last second Hook changed his mind and instead absorbs all the previous Dark Ones into [[Sword in the Stone (object)|Excalibur]] and told Emma to kill him, thus destroying the Darkness for good. Although Emma didn't want to go through with it, both herself and Hook saw there was no other way and after sharing one last kiss and declaring their love, Emma did as Hook requested and killed him. With the Darkness gone, Emma was restored to normal and Hook's wound from Excalibur returned, where Hook died in Emma's arms. However soon after Hook's death, Emma learns that Mr. Gold had once again betrayed them as secretly he transferred all the previous Dark One's powers into him, making him the Dark One again. Seeing that Hook's death was unfair, Emma decided to go into the [[Underworld]], along with her family, friends, and Gold to resurrect Hook.\n\nIn the Underworld, Hook somehow became a prisoner to the Ruler of the Underworld, [[Hades]]. Hook became trapped in an underground prison where he along with another prisoner, [[Megara]] were being guarded by [[Cerberus]]. Through unexplained events, Hook became badly injured, possibly trying to escape from the prison. Eventually, Hook and Megara made an attempt to escape together, although Megara informed Hook they wouldn't make it, Hook replied they wouldn't but Megara could. Hook told Megara to leave and find Emma and while she made her escape, Hook stayed behind to distract Cerberus. Eventually, Hook was brought to Hades to be guarded. Later, Hades informed Hook that Megara was able to move on from the Underworld and while Hook was glad for her, Hades was angered. He decided that as a way to replace the dead souls that had left the Underworld, Hades told Hook that three of his friends had to be chosen to stay in the Underworld and told Hook that he had to make the decision of who would stay.\n\nFollowing Killian's return Emma finally tells him she loves him. Just as the couple are about to have a passionate time, they are interrupted by a blimp owned by [[Mr. Hyde]].

Smith]], an animator at the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], used Captain Hook as a reference when creating [[Doctor Facilier]].\n**While making ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', [[Glen Keane]] used Captain Hook to study the movement of the mechanical arm for [[John Silver]].\n*Hook is briefly mentioned by [[Timon]] in the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' episode \"[[Ocean Commotion]]\".\n*Cary Grant and [[Robert Newton]] were both considered to voice Captain Hook.\n*According to an interview for ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', early concepts had Captain Hook wearing blue.\n*Interestingly, in the French translation of Disney's ''Peter Pan'', Hook takes the name of \"''James Bartholom\u00e9o Crochet''\" (literally James Batholomew Hook), while in some translations of the original J. M. Barrie's book ''Peter Pan'', his name is translated as \"''Jack Crochet''\" (literally Jack Hook).\n*In ''Jake and the Never Land Pirates'', it is revealed that Hook occasionally gets seasick (on sea as well as while crawling backwards) despite being a pirate captain.\n*In the queue for [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]], located at both [[Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]], there are several license plates hanging on the wall, all with various Disney references on them. One of the license plates is labeled \"CAP 10 HK\".\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n*{{WP}}\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/b/bc/Favicon(2).ico|Villains|James Hook (Disney)|Villains Wiki}}\n*{{KH|Captain_Hook}}\n*{{OUAT|Hook|Hook}}\n*{{OUAT|Hook (Wish Realm)|Hook {{Small|(Wish Realm)}}}}\n{{Peter Pan}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n{{Disney Heroes: Battle Mode}}\n[[da:Kaptajn Klo (karakter)]]\n[[es:Capit\u00e1n Garfio]]\n[[fi:Kapteeni Koukku]]\n[[fr:Capitaine Crochet]]\n[[it:Capitan Uncino]]\n[[nl:Kapitein Haak]]\n[[pl:Kapitan Hak]]\n[[pt-br:Capit\u00e3o Gancho]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0440\u044e\u043a]]\n[[Category:Peter Pan characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Article of the week]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Overtakers]]\n[[Category:Empire 50 Best Animated Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Soundsational Parade]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Electric Holiday]]\n[[Category:Disney Dream Portrait Series characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Live! characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts Bosses]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey Bosses]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Villains Tonight]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Adventurers]]\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney's Villains' Revenge characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Dreams! characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]\n[[Category:Werecreatures]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Mirrorverse Characters]]"
