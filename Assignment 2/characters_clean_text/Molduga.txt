Moldugas are recurring Sub-Bosses in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Moldugas are giant sand monsters that can be found in four locations in Gerudo Desert. They resemble a four-legged fish and lurk below the sand, patrolling their territory in search of prey. Once they become aware of Link's presence, they will barrel towards Link and attempt to ram into him. Moldugas can be fought while Shield Surfing with the help of a Sand Seal. They are very sensitive to loud noises, so they can also be fought by detonating Remote Bombs or shooting Bomb Arrows near them. This will cause a Molduga to fly out of the sand, stunned, and vulnerable to Link's attacks. If Link is especially quick, he can stun a Molduga as soon as its recovers.
When defeated, a Molduga drops one or two Treasure Chests containing various weapons, Molduga Fins, and Molduga Guts. Link must collect Molduga Guts in order to complete the "Medicinal Molduga" Side Quest. After completing the "Destroy Ganon" Main Quest, Kilton will give Link a Medal of Honor if he defeats all four Moldugas.

== Nomenclature ==
Molduga may pay tribute to the Wind Temple Boss in The Wind Waker, Molgera, who itself has its name derived from mogura, which is Japanese for mole. The four moldugas act similar to molgera, in which they are usually submerged in sand, further supporting this claim.
