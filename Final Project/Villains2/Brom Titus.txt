He is an Admiral of the Imperial Navy and was made commanding officer of [[Galactic Empire|Empire's]] new experimental vessel, the [[Imperial Interdictor|Interdictor]], using its gravity well projectors to pull rebel ships out of hyperspace.\n\n\n\n==Role in the Series==\nIn his debut, Titus captured Rebels [[Jun Sato|Commander Jun Sato]] and [[Ezra Bridger]]. He informed [[Agent Kallus]] of his captives, and despite his warnings not to underestimate the young Jedi-in-training, Titus remained confident that he could handle a child. Unfortunately Kallus' warning was proven right when Ezra escaped and was rescued by [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Rex (Star Wars)|Captain Rex]], who were disguised as [[Stormtroopers]]. In their escape, the Rebels destroyed his ship when the gravity well projectors pulled in every ship nearby, causing them to collide with his ship. However Titus got away in an escape pod before the ship's destruction, and was saved upon the arrival of Agent Kallus.\n\nFollowing his failure, Brom was demoted as a Commander of Reclem Station, a junk yard that was destroying old Republic starfighters, specifically [[Y-Wing]]s. The station was attacked by Ezra Bridger and his Rebel team. When Ezra reached him, he quickly overpowered him and, pointing his [[Lightsaber]] at him, forced Brom to release the Y-Wings from the magnetic locks. Brom told Ezra he had sabotaged the control unit, and the only way to release the fighters was be to risk shutting down all power throughout the station. Ezra took the risk, and after destroying the main power system he recommended that Brom flee while he had the chance, which he did.\n\nLater, Brom was interviewed along with\u00a0Captain Brunson\u00a0during\u00a0[[Thrawn|Grand Admiral Thrawn]]'s efforts to identify\u00a0Fulcrum, a rebel spy.\n\nHe has fought Ghost's Crew a last time with his Light Cruiser, the\u00a0Marauder. He is killed by [[Saw Gerrera]]'s explosives on Jalindi and his Light Cruiser is destroyed too.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The design of Brom Titus is very much influenced by the complexion and style shared by many of the local extras hired near Elstree Studios in the 1970s to fill in the background of Imperial scenes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nStealth Strike Concept 01.jpeg\nStealth Strike Concept 11.jpeg\nAdmiral Titus Card.jpg\nStealth Strike 18.jpeg\nStealth Strike 25.jpeg\nStealth Strike 37.jpeg\nSteps Into Shadow 27.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:starwars:Brom Titus|Brom Titus on Wookieepedia]].\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Admirals]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Commanders]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
