Just when they are about to get on their way, an orphaned pickpocket named [[Paco]] steals his wallet containing some important film that would help them find the lost city. They begin a manhunt for the boy but fail to get to him after [[Herbie]] helps him escape and get aboard a cruise ship to [[Panama]]. While Quinn and Prindle went after Paco while he waited with the plane.\n\nAfter failing to catch Paco, they regroup and continued their search for the boy and the car by plane. They managed to find them and trick Paco into picking up a passenger. They capture him and fly off leaving behind Herbie to go for help.\n\nPrindle, Shepard, and Quinn find the Inca ruins and to their delight an antique gold disc.
