He asks if {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} may be a traveler like him.<ref>{{Cite|Hm? Are you... Sorry to bother you, but are you a fellow traveler?|Pikango|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Pikango}} explains that he travels {{Term|BotW|Hyrule|link}} to find incredible sights to paint.<ref>{{Cite|As for me, I just looove art. In fact, I'm traveling the world in search of beautiful landscapes.|Pikango|BotW}}</ref> The reason he has returned to {{Term|BotW|Kakariko Village}} is to search for the {{Term|BotW|Great Fairy Fountain|link}} rumored to be there.<ref>{{Cite|Just between you and me... I hear there's a {{Color|BotW Red|Great Fairy Fountain}} somewhere near this village. I hear it's breathtakingly beautiful. Aesthetics aside, they also say the place can bestow some kind of mysterious power on people...|Pikango|BotW}}</ref> However, since he has not lived in the village for many years, he is unknown and considered an outsider, meaning nobody will say any more on the subject to him.<ref>{{Cite|However, since I'm an outsider, I can't get anyone to tell me any more details than that. These villagers never leave the safety of their village, so travelers like me are treated with suspicion.|Pikango|BotW}}</ref> Still, {{Term|BotW|Pikango}} is determined to find the Fountain and tells {{Term|BotW|Link}} that he will inform him of any new leads.<ref>{{Cite|But I won't give up! Oh, and if I manage to find out anything, I'll be sure to let you know.|Pikango|BotW}}</ref> Even in the {{Term|BotW|Rain|link}}, his determination only grows.<ref>{{Cite|But I'm not gonna give up! Not even if it rains! Not even if it snows! Not even if I get struck by lightning!!|Pikango|BotW}}</ref> At night, he will take refuge in the {{Term|BotW|Shuteye Inn|link}}, dreaming of locating the Fountain.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|{{Color|BotW Blue|Great Fairy Fountain}}... I will...find you...}}|Pikango|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce {{Term|BotW|Link}} returns to the village, {{Term|BotW|Pikango}} will tell him he knows where the {{Term|BotW|Great Fairy Fountain}} is, but can't get far enough to see it. He asks {{Term|BotW|Link}} if he will come with him to see it, and if {{Term|BotW|Link}} obliges, he leads him up to the forest near {{Term|BotW|Kakariko Village}}. Upon reaching the entrance, {{Term|BotW|Pikango}} runs out of breath and tells {{Term|BotW|Link}} to go ahead and see if he can find it. He also asks {{Term|BotW|Link}} to take a picture of it if he does stumble upon it. When {{Term|BotW|Link}} returns to show him the picture, {{Term|BotW|Pikango}} admits he thought it would look more 'elegant', but still offers to reward {{Term|BotW|Link}} for his help by telling him the location of one of the pictures on {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s {{Term|BotW|Sheikah Slate|link}}.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Term|BotW|Pikango}} is one of three {{Term|BotW|Sheikah}} (save the {{Plural|BotW|Monk|link}}) whose name isn't derived from a fruit, with another being {{Term|BotW|Impa|link}}, whose name pays tribute to previous {{Term|Series|Impa}}, and references her as the latest incarnation of the character. The other is {{Term|BotW|Master Kohga|link}}, who, along with the {{Term|BotW|Yiga|link}}, references Iga and Koga. {{Term|BotW|Pikango}} may come from \"Pic and go\", referencing the fact that he is a traveling painter. It also references {{Wp|Picasso}}, an artist who was notorious for his child-like paintings.\n\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Pikango Concept Artwork.png|Concept artwork of {{Term|BotW|Pikango}}\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Sheikah\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
