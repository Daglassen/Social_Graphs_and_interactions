She has a habit of calling everyone \"darling\".\n\nShe also has a very dismissive attitude towards [[Rebecca Cunningham|Rebecca]], for some reason, even before she finds out she's the culprit.\n\n==Role in the series==\nKitten first appears as the main antagonist of the episode \"[[A Star is Torn]]\". [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] saves her life and she invites him to co-star with her in her latest movie. But when they arrive, it turns out that the accident wasn't a coincidence\u2014it's one in a series of accidents that had been occurring on the Kitten Kaboodle movie set. Rebecca Cunningham tries to explain this to Baloo, but he's too star-struck by Kitten to listen.\n\nAs a result, Rebecca sets out to solve the case on her own and discovers Kitten as the culpit. Her last two movies did poorly and her movie career is almost ruined, so she caused the \"accidents\" as a way to raise her stardom. Rebecca manages to expose her during an unsuccessful \"accident\" that she set up for Baloo, by having Kitten blurt out her involvement while in a tantrum. Kitten is then arrested.\n\nKitten also makes a brief appearance in \"[[Louie's Last Stand]]\"; it's possible she made parole for good behavior or had made bail.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is a pun on the phrase \"The whole kit and caboodle\".\n\n==Gallery==\n===\"[[A Star is Torn]]\"===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nKitten Caboodle2.jpg\nA Star is Torn01.jpg\nA Star is Torn02.jpg\nA Star is Torn03.jpg\nA Star is Torn05.jpg\nA Star is Torn06.jpg\nA Star is Torn07.jpg\nA Star is Torn09.jpg\nA Star is Torn10.jpg\nA Star is Torn13.jpg\nA Star is Torn14.jpg\nA Star is Torn15.jpg\nA Star is Torn17.jpg\nA Star is Torn18.jpg\nA Star is Torn19.jpg\nA Star is Torn21.jpg\nA Star is Torn22.jpg\nA Star is Torn23.jpg\nA Star is Torn25.jpg\nA Star is Torn26.jpg\nA Star is Torn27.jpg\nA Star is Torn29.jpg\nA Star is Torn30.jpg\nA Star is Torn31.jpg\nA Star is Torn16.jpg|Kaboodle gets arrested\nKitten-Kaboodle146.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===\"[[Louie's Last Stand]]\"===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nKitten Kaboodle-Louie's Last Stand01.jpg\nKitten Kaboodle-Louie's Last Stand02.jpg\nKitten Kaboodle-Louie's Last Stand03.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nA Star Is Torn Concept 1.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kaboodle, Kitten}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
