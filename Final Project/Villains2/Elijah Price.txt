He was bullied by people and was nicknamed \"Mr. Glass\". His mother gave him plenty of comic books to read. By 2000, Elijah Price became fascinated with comic books and plotted several terrorist attacks to find a superhero. They all had but one survivor. He met David Dunn, who works for security. Elijah convinces David and his son that David is a superhero. Once David touches Elijah, David learned that Elijah is the terrorist behind several incidents.
