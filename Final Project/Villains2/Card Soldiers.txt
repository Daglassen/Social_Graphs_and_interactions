They make up the Queen's military force and obey her orders without question. However, they do so more out of fear of the Queen rather than loyalty to her.\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nThree card gardeners appear as [[Alice]] makes her way into the garden of the [[Queen of Hearts]]. She finds them painting white roses red. The cards explain that the white roses were planted by mistake and that they fear being beheaded if the mistake is not fixed. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, Alice offers to help them. Soon, however, the Queen appears and is shown to be angered more by the paint than the white roses. When none of the cards confess to the \"crime,\" she orders them all beheaded. The three gardeners are then dragged off by card guards.\n\nOther cards act as croquet hoops when the Queen challenges Alice. The cards openly cheat to allow the Queen to win; they move so that the Queen's ball goes through, but also make certain that Alice's does not. One card does not get to his spot in time, and so he is taken away to be beheaded.\n\nDuring Alice's trial, anonymous card soldiers act as Alice's guards. They surround the defendant's box and prevent Alice from escaping. Later, they chase after her as ordered by the Queen.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe cards are minor characters in the series and appear sometimes heckling performers like Timon and Pumbaa. In ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', they locked all the heroes in the kitchen as the villains took over.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nThe soldiers are present in the show with the [[Queen of Hearts]] and capturing [[the Evil Queen]] and the [[Mad Hatter]] when they visit Wonderland. However, they're not anthropomorphic cards, only disguised humans.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]''===\nThe Card Soldiers appear as enemy drones in ''Mickey Mousecapade''.\n\n===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===\nThe Card Soldiers are seen many times throughout the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, as residents of [[Wonderland]]. They are loyal guards to the [[Queen of Hearts]] and usually feature as enemies or mini-bosses. They are present in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', and ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded]]''.\n\n===''[[Disney Infinity]]''===\nThe Card Soldiers appear as enemies in this game.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*''Alice in Wonderland'' wasn't the first time Disney made 'card soldiers'. The [[1936]] short [[Mickey Mouse]] [[Thru the Mirror]] showed a similar army of cards. Like their Alice in Wonderland counterparts, they could fold on top of each other and were the servants of the Queen and King of Hearts.\n*According to their suit, the Card Soldiers (heart, diamond and spade) wield spears save for the clubs, who wield axes instead. In ''Kingdom Hearts'', only heart and spade soldiers appear, and the latter ones wield axes, contrary to their movie counterparts.\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n\n[[es:Los Naipes]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney's Villains' Revenge characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts Bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Alice In Wonderland objects]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
