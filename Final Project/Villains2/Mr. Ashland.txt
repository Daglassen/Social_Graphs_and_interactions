He is notable for being the only dinosaur who has higher control over WESAYSO than [[Bradley P. Richfield|B.P. Richfield]]. Richfield is in the same rank as that of another WESAYSO worker who was killed for disapproval by Mr. Ashland.\n\nHe appeared in \"[[Power Erupts]]\", proving that there are in fact dinosaurs even eviler than B.P. Richfield. Ashland summons Richfield, who kowtows before his superior, to discuss the corporation's strategy regarding [[Robbie Sinclair|Robbie Sinclair's]] free-energy concept. Ashland detests butt-kissers, mounting their heads on his wall, and keeps a pet lawyer, [[Elliot (Dinosaurs)|Elliot]], in a box on his desk.\n\nHis ambitions are even eviler than Richfield's. He believes that WESAYSO must gain their advantage by unfair cruelty to others, regardless of whom.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nashland&amp;elliot.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ashland}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]"
