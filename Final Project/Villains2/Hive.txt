He is primarily portrayed by [[Brett Dalton]], with Jason Glover portraying his original embodiment.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''====\nOriginally a Maya warrior in ancient times, he was captured by the alien [[Kree]], and became one of their first subjects to undergo Terrigenesis, a process used to create super soldiers known as Inhumans. Terrigenesis transforms him into a mass of cellular parasites which survives by inhabiting a dead human host, gaining their memories in the process, and he can manifest an alien-like head with protruding tentacles. Hive can expel the parasites to devour humans for nourishment, or infect Inhumans to \"sway\" them under his control in a hive mind. The ancient Inhumans feared him and used Kree technology to banish him to a faraway planet called Maveth. His remaining worshippers established a secret society to prepare the world for his return (ultimately evolving into the terrorist organization [[HYDRA]]) and provide new victims/hosts, including Lord Manzini (portrayed by Daniel J. Wolfe), Nathaniel Malick (portrayed by Joel Courtney), and NASA astronaut Will Daniels (portrayed by Dillon Casey). Through Hydra's efforts, Hive returns to Earth in the corpse of HYDRA leader Grant Ward (portrayed by Brett Dalton). Hive seizes control of HYDRA and recreates the Terrigenesis experiment, seizing a warhead to spread worldwide a virus that transforms humans into Hive-infected primitive Inhuman warriors. His efforts are thwarted by S.H.I.E.L.D. when [[Lincoln Campbell]] entraps them both in a space bound Quinjet containing the exploding warhead, killing them both.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In his last moments Hive admits that he only wanted to bring everyone together and make the world better. Though he grew disillusioned after learning of all the horrible atrocities humanity had caused since his banishment.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 5x12 - The Real Deal - 100th Episode - Season 3 Poster.jpg\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 3x12 - The Inside Man - Photography - Hive in Ward's Body.jpg|Hive takes control of [[Grant Ward|Ward]]'s body\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 3x12 - The Inside Man - Photography - Hive.jpg\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 3x12 - The Inside Man - Photography - Hive 2.jpg\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 3x12 - The Inside Man - Photography - Hive and Malick.jpg\nHive Ward 05.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
