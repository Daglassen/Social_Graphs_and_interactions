He was always trying to protect germs rather than get rid of them. Using his most recent invention, the Germinator Ray, Tobar shrunk himself down to microscopic size and snuck into Dr. Johnson's room. He managed to get inside [[Donald Duck]]'s body and into the brain. Once Tobar rewired the controls inside Donald's brain, he gained complete control of Donald's body and commenced his plan, which he referred to as \"Operation Germination\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTobar Germinator.png|Dr. Tobar miniaturizing himself\nGerminator (159).png\nGerminator (183).png\nGerminator (185).png\nGerminator (196).png\nGerminator (226).png\nQuack Pack Episode 8 The Germinator - YouTube45.jpg|Tobar controlling Donald\nPurple lava about to explode.png\nQuack Pack Episode 8 The Germinator - YouTube46.jpg|Tobar's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Quack Pack}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tobar}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
