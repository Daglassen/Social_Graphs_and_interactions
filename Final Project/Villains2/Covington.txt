[[Molly Cunningham]] soon discovered that doll.\n\nCovington soon discovered who took the the doll and began to work his charm on [[Rebecca Cunningham|Rebecca]]'s heart in order to get to the doll. Molly saw him for what he truly was and, knowing that he was really not interested in her mother, did everything she could to drive him away and keep him from getting his hands on the doll. After a series of tangles and shin-kicks from the little girl, he recovered the wooden figurine and briefly possessed the ruby statuette it pointed the way to, only to be foiled by Molly, who finally exposed him as a fraud to Rebecca. A little later on, after accidentally letting go of the ruby during a greedy struggle in a bubbling hot mud pit, he was finally caught by his ex-partners and received (off-screen) his just desserts from them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nmolly coddled 10_01.jpg\n458519-vlcsnap_01265_super.jpg\n10_04.jpg\nBecky05.jpg\nKitcloudkicker310.jpg\nMc45.jpg\nSkull_island06.jpg\n10_12.jpg\nMc1.jpg\n10_15.jpg\nBecky.jpg\nMolly049.jpg\nmolly coddled 10_11.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-08-19-23h16m59s757.png\nkicktheshin.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-08-19-23h17m51s985.png\nKitcloudkicker311.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-08-19-23h25m03s288.png|\"The question is, can ''you'' take it?\"\nmolly coddled 10_17.jpg|Covington's end\n</gallery>\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n\n[[Category:Jaguars]]"
