"Nobodies u30ce u30fc u30d0 u30c7 u30a3 u014dbadi are bizarre creatures created from the remains those who have lost their heart the Heartless the Kingdom Hearts series Kingdom Hearts series They are the second race appear the series generic enemies after the Heartless although they are not diverse their Heartless counterparts Nobodies are born when Heart swallowed darkness and becomes Heartless They are the remaining parts left behind the heart the body giving Nobody form and the soul giving the Nobody life However only those with strong will are actually able continue Nobodies Those with the strongest wills manage retain human forms while the rest are barely humanoid and appear within otherwise deformed shapes Therefore the more humanoid the Nobody the stronger its will Because their missing hearts Nobodies are said incapable feeling emotions every credible source and are shunned both Light and Darkness they are not meant truly exist Some humanoid Nobodies pretend possess emotions using the memories their former lives allowing them act Nobodies are also able operate with intelligence and can feel physical sensations such pain unlike the Heartless which are completely instinctive With their powers and resilience they not only rival the Heartless strength but their ability think and plan makes them all the more threat However seems that unusual Nobodies like Roxas and Namin u00e9 possess true emotions Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance proves this observation true all Nobodies Nobodies can indeed develop new hearts and emotions their own was the case with Roxas Axel and Namin u00e9 When defeated Nobodies return nothingness however when person Heartless and Nobody both are defeated that person restored their original complete form with their memories from their time Nobody intact However the Heartless must defeated first and the Nobody second said order for the person restored Several Nobodies Organization XIII mark the first appearance the Nobodies the series where they coax Sora into entering Castle Oblivion Marluxia who attempts manipulate Sora using Nobody named Namin u00e9 Kairi Nobody telling her that helping them gives her purpose life Unlike members Kingdom Hearts these members the Organization stationed Castle Oblivion didn use the services lesser Nobodies against Sora Riku Continuing their plan create Kingdom Hearts world Kingdom Hearts Organization XIII collects hearts through fighting the Heartless with the use Roxas and Xion Keyblades The Organization members are not accompanied lesser Nobodies during missions However Roxas faces Dusks and Samurais The World That Never Was which reappear when they attempt stop Roxas from leaving the Organization The Nobodies manage appear the simulated Twilight Town with Lea Axel trying retrieve Roxas when the latter trapped within the digital town After reawakening and entering Twilight Town Sora Donald Duck Donald and Goofy encounter group Nobodies front the train station but don know what they are When they meet Yen Sid u00a0at the Mysterious Tower explains the nature Nobodies and Organization XIII while telling them their new mission and gives them images what the Nobodies look like The remaining members Organization XIII appear the game and demonstrate different forms Nobodies exclusive each member which Sora ends clashing with The World That Never Was the lesser Nobodies witness the collapse the artificial Kingdom Hearts the hands Ansem the Wise and try catch the falling hearts some which spawn masses Heartless that swarm the castle The Nobodies returned the game alongside their Heartless and Unversed cohorts under the new order the Thirteen Seekers Darkness New variations appeared under the leadership List_of_Kingdom_Hearts_characters Marluxia Lauriam Marluxia and List_of_Kingdom_Hearts_characters Larxene Elrena Larxene When lesser Nobody destroyed they explode into bubbling light This the opposite the Heartless which vanish into dark smoke upon defeat seen countless times the heart soul and body single person will only make heartless and nobody However under unusual conditions more than nobody can created seen the case Sora who despite turning into heartless created nobodies Roxas and Namin u00e9 Although this only happened because Sora had more than heart his body the time their creation Namin u00e9 was made from Kairi heart and Roxas was made from Sora heart while the rest the Nobodies were both made from Sora soul and body because Kairi couldn turn into heartless due her being Princess Heart thus having heart pure light meaning her soul and body can leave the realm light Since they were both created Sora action simultaneously and both are made out Sora soul and body could argue that this would make them twins Ironically the end Kingdom Hearts Namin u00e9 and Roxas appear the credits scene that showing several couples the story which indicates that might not have been the intention the creators the game This clearly means body can reshaped additional heart being hosted the opposite gender Sora Nobody Roxas also unique was reshaped look much more like Ventus the owner the sleeping heart residing within Sora than Sora himself Thus should additional heart residing within the body chose stay with accidentally causes the Nobody take the heart original owner instead the person who became Nobody This why Roxas looks like Ventus instead Sora because Ventus heart remained within Sora turned into heartless the case the nobody and the complete person are existing simultaneously they seem feel when something happens them when they are close proximity each other examples Roxas fell into coma when Sora was getting his memory restored and Namine faded and out existence when Kairi was close proximity Usually for person returned their human form both their heartless and nobody would have destroyed for work but the case both Sora and Kairi another way was seen for someone obtain their complete form their case Sora became human again via Kairi power and Kairi kept her human form since she Princess Heart even without heart but she stayed comatose state until she recovered towards the end the first game Their Nobodies still continued exist apart from them after this and they developed their own identities both Sora and Kairi were already their human form they did not need destroy their Nobodies Eventually instead being destroyed Roxas and Namin u00e9 merged with their original selves Kingdom Hearts but they both are separated from Sora and Kairi again during Kingdom Hearts
