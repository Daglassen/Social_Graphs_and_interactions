He mostly acts as a spy by observing [[Star Butterfly]].\n\n==Background==\n===Powers and abilities===\n*'''Super-jumping:''' In \"[[On the Job]]\", it is revealed that Buff Frog has the ability to jump extremely high.\n*'''Prehensile/extendible tongue:''' In \"[[Is Mystery]]\", Buff Frog stretches his tongue a considerable distance and uses it to pick locks.\n\n== Role in the series ==\nAt the start of the series, Buff Frog was of Ludo's minions, whose main role was to spy on Star Butterfly during her stay on Earth in order to inform Ludo of the best chances to steal her wand.\n\nHowever, after Ludo hires a new monster named Toffee into his army, Buff Frog grows increasingly suspicious of him, especially after he steals his position as spy by replacing him with remote-controlled surveillance camera. After Toffee formulates a plan to steal the wand during Star's reenactment of a Mewnian holiday, Buff Frog volunteers to be the one to carry it out. However, the mission fails after the artifact that Toffee gave to Buff Frog to transport the wand to Ludo malfunctions and gets his cover blown by trying to steal it with his hands. Despite Buff Frog insisting that Toffee sabotaged him to humilliate him, Toffee uses the mission's failure to convince Ludo to fire Buff Frog and kick him out of the castle.\n\nDuring the season one finale, after being betrayed and usurped of his position of leader by Toffee, Ludo tries to convince Buff Frog to help him reclaim the castle but the monster turns him away do to still being angry for being fired. However, Ludo gets to his soft side by giving him a bunch of tadpoles as a gift, whom Buff Frog adopts as his children. Little after, Star arrives and questions them about Marco's whereabouts, who was kidnapped by Toffee's minions. Ludo ditches Buff Frog in favor of Star to assult the castle, but the princess ditches the little villain and instead follows Buff Frog inside, showing more trust to him after he cut his ties with Ludo. Together, they confront Toffee and his minions but get overpowered and then, Toffee forces Star to destroy her wand in order to save Marco's life. As the wand seemignly perishes, Star warns Buff Frog to run. Buff Frog quickly leaves the place moments before the wand explodes and destroys the whole castle.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nVlcsnap-2014-08-03-00h15m50s35.png\nseason 2 intro.PNG|looking at Star in a friendlier manner\nStar Comes to Earth 27.png\nThe other exchange student 7.jpg|Star and Buff Frog both see each other\nThe bathroom channel.png\nStorm the Castle 4.png\nStorm the Castle 3.png\nStarsitting-1.png\nOn the Job.png|Buff Frog with his children\nIs Another Mystery 1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nStar vs. the Forces of Evil Poster.jpg\nStar vs. the Froces of Evil Korea Banner.jpg|Korea banner\nLobster Claws Promo.jpg\nFortune Cookies Promo.jpg\nStorm the Castle poster.jpg\nFortune Cookies concept 3.jpg.jpg\nOn The Job poster.jpg\nIs Mystery poster.jpg\nBattle for Mewni poster.jpg\nSVTFOE Deep Trouble unreleased cover.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
