Seems like whoever does the hiring in [[King Triton]]'s palace doesn't do a great job screening possible employees because in the episode, Glowfish is seen to be working as a treasurer for the Atlantican king, when what he really wants is to have the treasure all for himself.\n\n==Gallery==\n\ufeff<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGlowfish.jpg\nglowfish2.jpg\nPez Brillo.jpg\nred73.jpg|Glowfish with Ariel and Sebastian\nred74.jpg|Glowfish with the Sorceress\nred76.jpg\nred90.jpg\nred141.jpg|Glowfish with Ariel and Red (King Triton)\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
