He was also slightly disapproving of the group's being called L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. He and the rest of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. went to a local dance competition, where all the press were. However, he was soon kicked off the show for his bad dancing and crushed by falling debris from [[Perry the Platypus]] (\"[[Nerdy Dancin']]\"). He made 2 other appearances one in Season 3 and one in Season 2 episodes \"[[Robot Rodeo]]\" and \"[[Bullseye!]]\" He in [[Robot Rodeo]] competing in it when the agents are freed they fight him and other members and destroy the inators. In [[Bullseye!]] he was in the opening song and voting for the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N Leader. He reappears in [[Phineas and Ferb Save Summer]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The Bully Code]]\" {{Small|First appearance}}\n*\"[[Nerdy Dancin']]\"\n*\"[[Robot Rodeo]]\" {{Cameo}}\n*\"[[Bullseye!]]\"\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb Save Summer]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*He does not dance very well (\"[[Nerdy Dancin']]\").\n*Bloodpudding is a food in Sweden and it's called \"blodpudding\" in Swedish.\n*He is the only known L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N member who's nemesis (Main) is unknown.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDr. Bloodpudding.1.png|Dr. Bloodpudding walking with a giant head baby head out of Dr,.
