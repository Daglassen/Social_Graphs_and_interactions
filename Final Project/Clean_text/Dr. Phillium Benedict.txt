Movie Burt Reynolds was originally considered for the role but was dropped out the film during production Despite his intelligence and former reputation educator Benedict very deluded and has lack common sense doesn realize that his plan bring permanent winter will only endanger billions lives opposed raising test scores and kids would granted school breaks either way Even when angrily pointed out the flaws the plot before the final fight Benedict didn care and instead continued with his plot saying that still could try His lack common sense and self delusion was also showcased when Prickly got the position Principal 3rd Street School where insisted believing that Prickly ratted him out specifically take over the position principal despite his surprised reaction when got the job making very clear that had not planned become principal all let alone take over from Benedict Benedict plan remove recess was tested the government the episode Recess Cancelled However the kids had way alleviate their stress their scores went down This proves that Benedict idea was very wrong unknown why didn use his Secretary Education fire Prickly and humiliate him that way Elements his character including his leading evil group well the first half the film obscuring his appearance either only showing his feet otherwise framing him shadow and his being merciless Rosenthal minions regarding failure resembled that the James Bond villain Wikipedia Ernst Stavro Blofeld Ernst Stavro Blofeld Benedict seems hate violence his henchmen never use machine guns any firearms for that matter such weapons could kill anyone who stands their way and would only far use tasers This evident his lieutenant Kojak used taser knock personnel unconscious when entering the military base that formerly housed the tractor beam and Benedict was willing use taser Prickly the climax Benedict could considered dark parallel both Principal Prickly and Miss Finster symbolizing what they might become they hadn u2019t learned appreciate recess and children"
