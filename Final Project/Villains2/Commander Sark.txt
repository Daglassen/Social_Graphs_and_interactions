GET THEM!|Sark ordering a pursuit on [[Kevin Flynn|Flynn]], [[Tron (character)|Tron]], and [[Ram]]}}\n'''Commander Sark''' is the\u00a0secondary antagonist of the [[1982]] science fiction film, ''[[Tron]]''.\n\n==Role in the film==\nSark is the [[Master Control Program]]'s guardian and second-in-command, who overviews the arrested programs and forces them to play life-threatening games, at which the loser is immediately derezzed. When Flynn arrives, he is subjugated by Sark and arrested along the other programs, meeting Tron in the process. After chasing the heroes, he battles Tron at Central Computer Mesa, the Master Control's fortress.\n\nTron ends up defeating Sark and destroys his identity disc. However, the MCP reanimates Sark's corpse, and as Sark stands up, his size increases to a colossal scale. As Sark was made from the Master Control's data, he is de-rezzed along with his master when Flynn sacrifices himself.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''===\nSark and the [[Master Control Program]] are the main antagonists of Space Paranoids. Sark has been made a [[Heartless]] commander by the MCP, empowering him even more. Not much of Sark is heard of after his first appearance, when he begins to de-rez Donald and Goofy in front of Sora and imprisons the three in the '''Pit Cell'''. Not long after their imprisonment, Sark is called up by the MCP and suggests that Tron is de-resolution but the MCP wants to keep Tron because the latter has access to the password of the [[Door to Darkness|DTD]] database.\n\nHis second appearance is at the boss battle against the MCP. Strangely enough, despite having met before, here Sora cannot remember Sark's name until Tron refreshes him. The normal Sark is fought, along with his Identity Disc. Weakened, he tells Tron that they could have made a great team, but Tron flings his Identity Disc at him and knocks him unconscious, as he is more or less a program, and programs can't be killed, only deleted.\n\nNot long after, the MCP revives him and grants all his functions to him, causing him to enlarge. He is a second-hand enemy as his giant-self while you fight the MCP. Like the movie, Sark is defeated along with the MCP, being de-rezzed.\n=== Video Games ===\n===Fall Guys; Ultimate Knockout===\nCommander Sark appeared as a costume in Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, each half (top and bottom) being able to do be purchased for 11,000 Kudos each from the in-game shop periodically, with the first instance occurring on May 24th, 2021\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBlue Sark.jpg|Originally, Sark and all of the villains were going to be blue.
