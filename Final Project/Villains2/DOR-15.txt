Cornelius acted quickly to deactivate her and she was placed into a Robinsons Industries storage room for prototypes and failed inventions. She soon reactivated and escaped, meeting [[Michael \"Goob\" Yagoobian (The Bowler Hat Guy)|Bowler Hat Guy]], who was egging and toilet papering the Robinsons Industries building as an attempt for revenge. They discovered they shared the same hatred of Cornelius and decided to team up in an attempt to destroy the future he created by stealing the [[Time Machine #2|second Time Machine]] and presenting Doris to the [[Inventco]] board, though Goob made the additional suggestion of stealing the [[Memory Scanner]] at the Science Fair as a way to put his foot in the door before presenting Doris as well.\n\n===Personality===\nOriginally invented as a fashionable personal assistant and headgear, DOR-15 turned out evil, wishing to be the master rather than a helper. After escaping [[Lewis Robinson|Dr. Robinson]]'s vault of failed inventions, she vowed revenge against her creator for trying to shut her down and lock her away.\n\nShe was willing to partner with Mike Yagoobian as a means to an end, although she was clearly infuriated by his stupidity, particularly when his incompetence got [[Mini-Doris]] captured, as she slapped him with the control.\n\nUltimately, DOR-15 represents one of the many costly consequences of Dr. Robinson's actions in his lifetime aside from unintentionally depriving Goob of his future. Had her escape from the prototype room be made known to him earlier, DOR-15 would have been properly deactivated, thus enabling Goob to be apprehended for vandalism on Robinson Industries.\n\n==Role in the [[Meet the Robinsons|film]]==\nUpon their theft of the time machine, [[Wilbur Robinson]] pursued the two through time, though had to contend with an altered future twice before successfully meeting with Lewis, taking him to 2037 to prove his claims of being from the future and attempt to convince him the Memory Scanner was worthwhile.\n\nThough they stole the Memory Scanner, the duo lacks the knowledge of how to use it and sought to find Lewis in order to find out how. After being told by Goob's younger self that Lewis likes to spend a lot of time on the roof, Doris found time travel residue next to Wilbur's DNA and the duo returned to the future, where they attempted to infiltrate the Robinson house. Doris created a mini Doris for Goob to control so he wouldn't have to leave the time machine. Doris soon attempted to drop a chandelier on Lewis, only for Goob to independently go back and mind control a [[Tiny (Meet the Robinsons)|T-Rex]] to get Lewis, to her fury.\n\nHowever, upon learning that Wilbur lied about their deal to go and see his mother in the past, he runs into Bowler Hat Guy and fixes the stolen scanner for him in exchange for seeing his mother in the past. Lewis is shocked to discover Bowler Hat Guy's identity as his Orphanage roommate Goob as well as the truth that he is Wilbur's father, Cornelius. Wilbur and [[Carl (Meet the Robinsons)|Carl]] come to Lewis' rescue and take back the Memory Scanner. However, just before getting back to [[Anderson Observatory]], Carl is attacked by Doris, who steals the scanner once more. Wilbur pleads Lewis to fix the Time Machine to pursue before being wiped from existence. Doris succeeds in her plot, altering the future into one controlled by mass-produced 'Helping Hats', as well as a large mobile base called [[Mega-Doris]], which had taken Anderson Observatory's place as well as contain the Doris controlled Robinson family. Lewis managed to fix the [[Time Machine #1|original Time Machine]] and escaped back to Bowler Hat Guy's presentation to Inventco. When Doris tries to kill him, Lewis declares that he will never invent her and she is wiped out from existence, causing the future to be restored along with Wilbur.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===\nA Doris-shaped\u00a0[[Beetleworx|beetleworx]]\u00a0appears in the game.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:04 - Doris.jpeg|thumb|Doris' [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] card]] Doris has her own spell card known as \"Doris' Bowler Hat Attack\" in the attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]. She is one of the very few villains to have a card since the event is themed around invoking mostly good characters to fight the major Disney villains.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDoris.jpg\nDOR-15.jpg\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-7700.jpg|DOR-15 meets Bowler Hat Guy.\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-7728.jpg\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-7750.jpg|DOR-15 mind-controlling a test subject\nRobinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-7469.jpg\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-5202.jpg\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-7833.jpg\nMachine Doris hats.png|Machine, which was creating the copies of DOR-15\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-8323.jpg\nDoris's world.png|DOR-15 took over the world\nRobinson Mind control.png|DOR-15 mind controls of Robinsons\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-8654.jpg\nRobinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-8304.jpg\nRobinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-8322.jpg|Lewis vows to never invent DOR-15\nRobinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-8328.jpg\nMeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-8675.jpg|DOR-15's destruction\nDoris After Hours.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Theoretically speaking, even if Doris had killed Lewis she would still exist since Bowler Hat Guy would still be able to recreate her just without her memories.  \n*Doris is one of the eleven Disney Villains from animated movies who is pure evil. The other ten are the Coachman, Chernabog, Maleficent, the Horned King, Percival C. McLeach, Scar, Judge Claude Frollo, Shan Yu, Lyle Tiberius Rourke, and King Runeard.\n*Doris can be considered one of Disney's darkest villains for what she intends to do to the future.\n*In a strange twist, Doris could be considered the first \"true\" individual CGI villain in a Disney film while also being a sentient inanimate object; this is notable due to the earliest CGI characters in Disney films were also inanimate objects, such as the [[Golden Pelydryn]] in ''[[The Black Cauldron]]'' and the [[Magic Carpet]] in ''[[Aladdin]]''.\n**This takes into account the [[Carnotaurus]] in ''[[Dinosaur]]'' working as a pack and the less than menacing actual purpose of the aliens from ''[[Chicken Little]]''.\n\n{{Meet the Robinsons}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n[[Category:Meet the Robinsons characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Articles of Clothing]]\n[[Category:Meet The Robinsons objects]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Technology]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Disney Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
