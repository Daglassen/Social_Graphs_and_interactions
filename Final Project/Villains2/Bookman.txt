He, like [[Miss Eglantine Price]], was seeking the\u00a0Substitutiary Locomotion spell. After having his henchman Swinburne \"encourage\" Miss Price, Mr.\u00a0Emelius Browne,\u00a0and the children to see him, he and [[Miss Eglantine Price]]\u00a0decide to cooperate and trade each of their halves of the book. As he and Miss Price both come to the conclusion that they've reached another dead end, the Bookman mentions a passage later in his half of the book that talks about Astoroth's fate. He spoke of experiments Astoroth was performing to make animals more human. The animals rebelled, killed Astoroth, and took off for\u00a0[[The Isle of Naboombu|Isle of Naboombu]]\u00a0which he said\u00a0\"Does not exist\". Then [[Paul (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|Paul]] says it does exist and brings out his children's book from underneath the covers of the bed. The Bookman wanted to see the book but Paul refused. Then he and [[Swinburne]] threatened Miss Price, Emelius and the children at knife point. At that point Miss Price, and the children, climbed on to the bed. [[Professor Emelius Browne]] then told the Bookman that the bed and all on it would disappear. The Bookman said, \"I'd like to see a cheapjack tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.\" That made Mr. Browne angry. Miss Price told Paul to have the bed go to the Isle of Naboombu. The Bookman ordered his minion [[Swinburne]] to get the book, but by then it had already disappeared along with the bed.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Bookman is the first Disney Villain to have one part of a book that the hero needs. Usually, the part the hero owns has something important is it that the villain needs to use for their own nefarious plans. The Bookman has the part of\u00a0[[The Spells of Astoroth]]\u00a0for the\u00a0[[Substitutiary Locomotion]]\u00a0spell. The second villain to have part of a book the hero needs is\u00a0[[Lyle Tiberius Rourke]]\u00a0from\u00a0''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]. ''He has a page of the\u00a0[[Shepherd's Journal]]\u00a0which contains information about the\u00a0[[Heart of Atlantis]]. The third is [[Mittington Random]] in the\u00a0''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''\u00a0episode \"[[The Klimpaloon Ultimatum]]\",\u00a0having the second journal of [[Klimpaloon]]\u00a0which contains the map to Klimpaloon.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nBedknobs-Broomsticks-bedknobs-and-broomsticks-6669252-853-480.jpg|Bookman defeated\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bedknobs and Broomsticks}}\n[[Category:Bedknobs and Broomsticks characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
