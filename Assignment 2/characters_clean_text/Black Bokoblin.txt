Black Bokoblin are enemies in the The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Black Bokoblins are a stronger variant of Blue Bokoblins. They are much more resilient and are usually armed with stronger Weapons than their common counterparts, including Dragonbone Boko Clubs and Dragonbon Boko Bats. Black Bokoblins may be found in monster camps and occasionally on roads where they may attack passing travelers. Black Bokoblins may also sometimes be found going on hunts while riding Horses.
Black Bokoblins share an attack pattern with other Bokoblin counterparts. On the ground, Black Bokoblins mainly attack by swinging and slamming their held Weapons. In the event that their Weapons is lost or stolen, they will search for any other available Weapons nearby and use them instead. In some monster camps, Black Bokoblins may also be found standing on top watch towers, where they may alert other monsters to Link's presence by blowing a horn. These Black Bokoblins may also be equipped with Bows that they use to snipe intruders with Arrows.
When defeated, Black Bokoblins may drop Bokoblin Fangs, Bokoblin Horns, or Bokoblin Guts.
