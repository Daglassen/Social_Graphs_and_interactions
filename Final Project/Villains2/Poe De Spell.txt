He is [[Magica De Spell]]'s brother who was turned into a raven, and now serves Magica as her familiar.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\nHow exactly Poe was transformed into a raven is never explained in the series. Although Magica has various transformation spells at her disposal, she is unable to turn Poe back into an anthropomorphic duck. In the episode \"[[Send in the Clones]]\", Magica explains that she needs the power of [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s [[Number One Dime]] to restore Poe to his normal self, indicating that she means to turn him back. On top of that, Poe only appears in some episodes featuring Magica, and rarely does anything to advance the plot. Poe's most notable role is in the episode \"[[Magica's Shadow War]]\", in which a trapped Magica sends him out to find help in one scene.\n\n===''Darkwing Duck'' comics===\nPoe appears in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' story \"[[Crisis on Infinite Darkwings]]\", where he is looking for Magica and [[Negaduck]]. He also makes a cameo appearance in \"[[Dangerous Currency]]\", where he gets some slime \u2014 this is how Magica discovers how the slime works.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nPoe appeared in ''[[The Life and Crimes of Scrooge McDuck!]]''. This time, he appears in his original form. He is shown to rule over a village, alongside Magica, until they come into conflict with Scrooge. Scrooge is able to play on Magica's short temper, getting her to borrow Poe's magic amulet. After gaining Poe's magic, she begins firing multiple shots of transfiguration spells off at Scrooge. After some time and nearing the end of the battle, Scrooge uses his lucky Number One Dime to reflect the final spell cast, back at Magica. However, in an attempt to save his sister, Poe jumps in the way of the blast, resulting in him turning into a crow with no sentience. With no memory of his former life, Poe mindlessly flies out a hole made from the scuffle, and hasn't been seen since.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is a reference to [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who wrote a story called \"The Raven\". Also referencing \"The Raven\", Poe often ends his stanzas with the word \"nevermore\".\n*Poe replaces Magica's pet raven Ratface from the original ''Uncle Scrooge'' comic series. Poe ''and'' Ratface appear together at the end of the ''Rightful Owners'' story arc in [[Boom! Studios]]' ''DuckTales'' comic.\n*Magica has a niece called [[Minima De Spell]], but it's unknown whether she is Poe's daughter or not. \n*In the reboot, Poe\u2019s magic gem (the primary source of his powers) was stolen by Magica in an attempt to defeat Scrooge after Scrooge picks up on the fact that Poe and Magica rely on each other. Additionally, Magica made a shadow clone named Lena after being trapped in Scrooge\u2019s Number One Dime, whom she refers to as her \u201cniece.\u201d Since Magica has been using her and Poe\u2019s magic the whole time, this technically makes Lena Poe\u2019s \u201cdaughter\u201d since it was from his and Magica\u2019s combined magic that created her, which would explain why Magica is referred to as her \u201caunt.\u201d\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMagica.jpg\nMagica02.jpg\nMagica03.jpg\nMagica06.jpg\nMagica&Dime.jpg\n640px-Ducktale4Magica.png|Poe ''and'' Ratface interestingly appear together at the end of ''DuckTales'' #4 (Boom!
