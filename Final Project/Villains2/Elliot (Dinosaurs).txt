"[[File:Lawyerelliot.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Elliot''' is a small but toothy mammal and antagonist who acts as a [[WESAYSO]] attorney in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode \"[[Power Erupts]]\". He was performed by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Allan_Trautman Allan Trautman].\n\nConfronted by the threat to their profits presented by the Sinclair Dome, CEO [[Mr. Ashland]] and [[Bradley P. Richfield|B.P. Richfield]] discuss the issue. While Richfield suggests eating [[Robbie Sinclair]], Ashland points out that powerful executives don't eat their enemies. They have lawyers for that. For exactly that purpose, Elliot resides in a box on Ashland's desk and pops up excitably when the word \"lawyer\" is mentioned, eager to fulfill his duty.\n\n{{MuppetsWiki|Elliot}}{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Lawyers]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
