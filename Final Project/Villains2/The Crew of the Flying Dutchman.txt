As the crewmen serve their hundred-year sentence aboard the [[Flying Dutchman]], they begin to alter and transform into more monstrous beings; fused with the various creatures of the sea. This is due to the fact that Jones no longer ferries the dead of the sea to their final resting place as his job first entailed, and as such, the reason they are cursed along with him. Because of this, they also could not die or be killed easily until released from their years of service. However, the longer the crew stayed aboard the Dutchman in this state, the more they lost who they were until they literally became part of the ship.\n\nWhen [[Will Turner]] is made new captain of the Dutchman, the ones who survived the Battle of the Maelstrom are cured of the curse, and Will gives the order to ready the ship's guns and help the [[Black Pearl]] finish Lord [[Cutler Beckett]] once and for all. No longer bound to the Dutchman, most of the crew, save for Bootstrap Bill, depart the ship; free once more.\n\n==Crew==\n*'''[[Bootstrap Bill Turner]]''' - Formerly a crew member of the ''Black Pearl'', Bootstrap chose to serve aboard Davy Jones' ship after being sent to the ocean floor by Barbossa and his crew.\n*'''[[Maccus]]''' - Davy Jones' First Mate.
