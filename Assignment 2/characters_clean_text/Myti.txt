Myti is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Myti is an employee of the Outskirt Stable. She can be found standing next to the Stable's Cooking Pot and asks Link if he would like to use it. If Link inquires about the Cooking Pot, she will explain that as the Stable does not serve food, guests are expected to prepare their own. If Link declines the offer, she will instruct him to speak to Embry for assistance and to Trott for directions.
If it begins to Rain, Myti will take shelter under the Stable's roof and instruct Link to do the same. If Link inquires about the Cooking Pot while she is inside, she will suggest Link stays the night as the Cooking Pot can't be used while it is Raining.
In the evening, Haite joins Myti at the Cooking Pot for dinner. Myti will head into the Stable late at night and sit at the lone table. If Link attempts to speak to her, she will tell him to talk with her later. Around midnight, she will fall asleep while at the table and sleep talk about vegetables. She will sleep there until 6:05 AM.
