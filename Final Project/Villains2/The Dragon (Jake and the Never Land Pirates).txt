The [[Dragons|dragon]] lives on the active volcano-covered island known as the [[Island of Bell]] guarding the path to the legendary golden bell. He is known to hate visitors and will attack any and all who will invade the island.\n\n\n\n\n\n==Role in the series==\nAfter [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew sneak aboard the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] with help from\u00a0[[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]], they\u00a0retrieve the other half of the pirate code scroll from a sleeping [[Captain Hook]]. They learn that if they can retrieve the golden bell, [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] would be theirs once more. The only thing standing in the sea pups' way was the feared fire-breathing dragon. After flying to the Island of Bell, the dragon appears to challenge the pirates. Jake and Peter distract the dragon, allowing [[Izzy]] and [[Skully]] to retrieve the golden bell.. The dragon is last seen constantly chasing after his own tail in the maze-like caves, whilst Jake and his crew regroup to steal the bell, and save Bucky from Captain Hook.\n\nIn the Season 4 episode, [[Tales of Captain Buzzard]], the dragon re-appears and traps [[Captain Buzzard Bones|Captain Buzzard]], Hook, [[Mr. Smee|Smee]], [[Sharky and Bones|Sharky, and Bones]] in a cave. Eventually Captain Jake and his crew rescue them, and with the help of Izzy's [[Pixie Dust]], the dragon is sent flying, presumably back to the Island of Bell.\n\n<br />\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Whilst the dragon doesn't make any appearances in between the episodes, ''Jake Saves Bucky'' and ''Tales of Captain Buzzard,'' his character model was used for [[Captain Flynn]]'s dragon companion, Belchy, who appears in the episode, ''[[Cubby's Tall Tale]]''.\n* Despite being called a dragon he actually resembles a Wyvern, the key difference has been that a wyvern has two legs, whereas a dragon has four. However, this distinction is not commonly observed in the heraldry of other European countries, where two-legged dragon-like creatures being called dragons is entirely acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:The Dragon}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Dragon, The}}\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
