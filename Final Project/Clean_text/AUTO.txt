"AUTO short for Autopilot the main antagonist the 2008 Walt Disney Pictures Disney u2022 Pixar animated feature film WALL film WALL WALL character WALL arch nemesis 700 years before the events the movie the megacorporation Buy Large BnL was fault for making the planet toxicity levels drastically high was high fact that the president CEO Buy Large Shelby Forthright had given directive 113 the year 2110 years earlier year 2105 was the origin the cleanup operation which had been deemed bitter failure Thusly directive 113 transferred all control the Autopilot units and prohibited any return Earth AUTO personality resembles much the personality HAL 9000 from 2001 Space Odyssey machine shows kind emotion and just complies with the orders that have been given him the Chairman Axiom Corporation through the A113 Protocol such because his programmed orders also can quite ruthless the desperate pursuit his orders success even means forcing the human crew comply against their will Shipboard Control Access Being the steering wheel AUTO has full control the Axiom Internal Systems and able directly interface with the panels Bridge with his arms access the Systems remotely seen when AUTO locks out Captain McCrea without even touching any panels Extendable Arms AUTO arms function both handle for the Captain and also finger for AUTO interact with the panels the bridge and poking device One his arms also has claw help AUTO pick and hold things seen when tried snatch the plant from both McCrea and WALL Taser One AUTO arms has built retractable taser for AUTO defend the Bridge against mutiny from rogue robots passengers and protect the Captain Ironically the taser was used for the mutiny being used successfully WALL and unsuccessfully Captain McCrea this time more specifically the year 2805 humans still remain space and are morbidly obese because extreme bone deterioration and rely too heavily the technologies upon the Axiom AUTO still bent following his directive and has become the commander the Axiom because Captain McCrea does little other than tell the morning announcements and watches over the ship waiting for EVE Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator Probe that scans Earth for any signs plant life which comes back positive and being left the dark about AUTO true colors When specific EVE does indeed return positive the 113 clearly seen AUTO eye and thus AUTO nabs the plant from EVE without her knowing and gives his right hand lackey from there try and discard Then when EVE brought McCrea room she doesn realize she was empty handed until when AUTO scans her and finds nothing After McCrea declares false alarm all returns normal and EVE then named faulty AUTO and the Captain well and MVR transport bot then take EVE check for evaluation After while the Captain scans the dirt that WALL left behind instantly striking his curiosity and asks his main computer questions about Earth Ocean and all other subjects which had clue AUTO becomes apparently suspicious that action now that the Captain armed with the knowledge what AUTO kept his robotic voice box shut about and thus they promptly call night but not before the Captain asking what dancing was which the computer responded All this would trigger the mutiny AUTO when McCrea was busy watering the plant caring for like gardener would and then when spoke those words looked the globe representing Earth before the events the movie and then the yellow ball high toxicity levels which was still Earth thus their home nonetheless McCrea eyes stating that they had return Earth McCrea thus calls AUTO the room get him put the plant the holo detector they could hyper jump Earth When AUTO sees the plant that thought was disposed then displays the directive again and declares that not necessary return Earth McCrea not paying attention states fire the Holo detector himself AUTO then stops him and insists that McCrea hand over the plant which McCrea responds telling him move out the way AUTO continues saying they cannot return Earth and when questioned McCrea AUTO refuses answer classified and when McCrea pushes the matter saying that AUTO not allowed withhold details from the Captain AUTO tries nab the plant from him but McCrea keeps bay from him Finally McCrea demands that AUTO tell him what was classified about that matter saying that was order AUTO finally relents and shows him what was classified and what was left out the dark about the video was the events 695 years ago the Axiom was sent into space 2105 was CEO and President Buy Large Shelby Forthright obviously embarrassed beyond reason about his failure try save Earth himself that time the video was guessed that Operation Recolonize had become failure because even with the WALL units trying their best was nothing more than unrealistic have the Earth clean years due the many forms pollution and litter and all but WALL had been shut down overwhelmed add fuel the fire his shame Shelby then says all Autopilots that would easier for humans remain space and that life was longer good for Earth due the toxic levels Shelby then leaves with the same directive given 695 years prior the movie 113 and declared that Autopilots are charge the ship would total control and returns Earth would denied and Shelby leaves thereafter After the clip McCrea then asks when the message was sent out and the computer replies 2110 calculates nearly 700 years ago McCrea scoffs the President BnL words and says that things have changed and the plant was proof that and further backs his point saying the plant was alive and growing AUTO says that irrelevant McCrea then argues that all too relevant because back the place was their home and saying that McCrea can just sit there and nothing which what most the people and himself have done obviously which confesses that all the people and himself have ever done nothing all AUTO then declares must follow the directive which frustrates McCrea Noticing the pictures all the captains from generations down McCrea notices that AUTO everyone meaning was the true captain the Axiom the others were merely figureheads McCrea then stands AUTO and declares that they are going home whether not AUTO liked which AUTO didn Though got really close the Captain face simply called over who snatched the plant from McCrea and buzzed him when tried get back McCrea then realized that this was mutiny With his side seemed like had the upper hand until WALL appeared from the garbage chute AUTO then demanded that WALL gives him the plant which WALL doesn and stores away his body door smacking AUTO the process WALL then gloats his victory but AUTO just responded zapping him with taser and severely damaging him causing WALL fall back down the garbage chute taking the plant with him AUTO then shuts off EVE and promptly throws her the garbage chute AUTO then tells McCrea that all communications are cut off and confines him his quarters Just when AUTO thought that won that battle sees rogue robots warning showing WALL EVE and the plant that was taken the Stewards much his disbelief then sends every other SECUR after them Just then the Captain then hot wired the monitor send out message him holding the plant which was holographic image WALL holding and taunts AUTO saying that wanted the plant back McCrea then says Come and get Blinky AUTO then scans the room looking for McCrea reclaim the plant McCrea then ambushes AUTO and somehow winds the command deck where AUTO ruling everything squeezing through hole the ceiling tries help AUTO but only winds getting himself knocked back the fight flung through window from the tower from the impact the Captain hitting him and crash lands besides pool the Lido Deck breaking him McCrea and AUTO continue the battle for dominance the Captain successfully hits the button that activates the holo detector initiating the recolonizing sequence and automatically caused all passengers report the Lido deck where the holo detector located After noticing that WALL EVE and the plant were close the holo detector AUTO finally has enough and easily knocks McCrea away turning himself the left Since the Axiom wheel this causes the ship tilt left knocking everyone down that direction then goes over push the holo detector button turn off but WALL attempts keep back putting himself between and the floor Auto pushes the button again this time holding down keep going down WALL however kept holding the holo detector though his treads were dangerously close the gap between and the floor Finally last resort Auto activated his taser and used push the button hard that cracked Though the holo detector was only several inches closing caused WALL get crushed and jammed between the gap Despite the fact that McCrea was without his chair stood straight and ambushed AUTO again after seeing AUTO crush WALL with the holo detector possible that McCrea after seeing WALL crushed AUTO found the will stand and continue the battle the Captain calls for rematch AUTO fires his taser again but before can try zap McCrea the Captain then sees the only way subdue AUTO was turn his Auto switch Manual which McCrea ends AUTO and directive A113 flipping the exposed switch manual pilot AUTO then gives last and shuts off leaving McCrea control the Axiom and the end the end the line for AUTO now just regular ship wheel McCrea then uses him turn the Axiom back its original position and steer back Earth Trivia Villains"
