== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Ice-Breath Lizalfos are one of the elemental variants of Lizalfos. They can spit out balls of Ice that break into bursts of cold air when they make contact with the ground. They have a moderate amount of health at 288. Hitting an Ice-Breath Lizalfos with a Fire attack, such as with Fire Arrows or a Flameblade, evaporates it instantly. They are mostly found in snowy areas, such as the northern Gerudo Highlands and the Hebra Mountains. When defeated, they may drop Lizalfos Horns, Lizalfos Talons, and Icy Lizalfos Tails.
