Alioth is living tempest that consumes everything that is sent to [[the Void]] at the end of time after being pruned by the [[Time Variance Authority]]. It also guards the entrance of the [[Citadel at the End of Time]], which is the home of the creator of the organization, [[Kang#He Who Remains|He Who Remains]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Dialogue2|He Who Remains|That first [[Variants|Variant]] encountered a creature created from all the tears in reality, capable of consuming time and space itself.

Always.}}\n\nAlioth is living tempest, a creature born from the tears in reality, and is able to consume time and space itself. A long time ago, there was a Multiversal War caused by the [[Variants|many versions]] of [[Kang]] who fought for the supremecy of their own timelines. However, one of these Variants found Alioth and another one, known as [[Kang#He Who Remains|He Who Remains]], made experiments on it. He Who Remains managed to harness Alitoh's power and weaponize it to end the Multiversal War by pruning the timelines, eliminating his other Variants. He then reorganized the multiverse into a single timeline, the Sacred Timeline, and created the [[Time Variance Authority]] to maintain it without branches. Meanwhile, Alioth was settled in [[the Void]] at the end of time, where it currently lives consuming everything that is sent there by the TVA and protecting the entrance of the [[Citadel at the End of Time]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''====\n=====Season One=====\nIn the [[Journey into Mystery|fifth episode]], after [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] was pruned by [[Ravonna Renslayer|Judge Ravonna Renslayer]] and sent to [[the Void]], he is found by his own [[Variants]]: [[Kid Loki]], [[Alligator Loki]], \u00a0[[Classic Loki]] and [[Boastful Loki]]. They tell Loki that they have to walk away from the place to survive and Kid Loki warns Loki to be careful to not alarm Alioth. Kid Loki explains that they are at the Void, where the [[Time Variance Authority]] sends everything that they pruned and the creature in the sky, Alioth, makes sure nothing returns. Boastful Loki says that Alioth is a living tempest that consumes all the matter and energy that arrives, being able to devour entire branched realities that are sent there in an instast. Classic Loki then states that the Void is like a shark tank, with Alioth being the shark.\n\nAfter the Lokis walked to their hideout, Loki tells them that he needs to return to the TVA to find a female Loki Variant called [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]] and, in order to do it, he will confront Alioth. Loki tells them that the Lokis had said that Alioth is the only thing keeping them at the Void, that it is a living creature and had compared it to a shark, so he concluded that if Alioth is alive, it can be killed. Loki then asks for their help to kill Alioth, but the other Lokis just laugh because they think it is impossible to do so. However, later when the Lokis see how much Loki trusts Sylvie and her determination to destroy the TVA, they agree to help. Despite this, Classic Loki explains that getting close to Alioth is extremely dangerous, so they will only help Loki get to it and nothing more.\n\n[[File:Sylvie connects with Alioth EP5.png|thumb|left|250px|Sylvie connects with Alioth and sees a glimpse of the Citadel at the End of Time beyond the Void.]]\n\nMeanwhile at the TVA, Sylvie prunes herself, being sent to the Void, and immediately encounters Alioth. She is forced to run away as the tempest chases her, but while she is trying to escape it, she manages to link with Alioth and sees a glimpse of something beyond the Void, also realizing that the creature can be enchanted. She is rescued by [[Mobius]] who appears driving a car. Sylvie tells Mobius that she pruned herself with the intent to find Loki in the Void, but she is now frustrated thinking that Alioth might have already devoured him. She says that she is now focused in finding the creator of the TVA and Alioth might be the answer to it, so she asks Mobius to turn the car back to the storm. Mobius is perplexed that Sylvie wants to confront the angry cloud from which they just escaped from.\n\nWhile Loki and the other Lokis are planning how to defeat the creature, Loki suggests finding a weak part as a brain or a heart to attack it. Loki thinks that Alioth is just like any other animal, so he will be distracted eating something big and give them the chance to sneak behind it and kill it. The others become uncertain about this plan and Classic Loki says that Alligator Loki thinks that they are all going to die. They become even more skeptical as they watch Alioth from afar and witness it devouring a entire ship with its crew when they appear at the Void. Then, Sylvie and Mobius that were in their way to return to Alioth, appear and reunite with Loki. \n\nLoki tells Sylvie about his plan to kill Alioth, but she thinks that it is absurd and will not work. She is surprised that the other Lokis agreed with his plan, although they state that they had their doubts if it would work. Sylvie tells them that she thinks that the creator of the TVA is beyond the Void at the end of time and is using Alioth as a guard dog to protect entrance. When Loki asks what her plan is to defeat Alioth and get to the TVA ruler, she replies that she will enchant it. Loki is skeptical about her plan, but she says that it is better than trying to stab a giant cloud to death and is confident that it will work.\n\n[[File:Alioth comes after Sylvie EP5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Loki tries to distract Alioth, but it goes after Sylvie while she is trying to enchant it.]]\n\nLater, just before confronting Alioth, Kid Loki tells them where a branched timeline will appear, so Sylvie will wait until the creature is distracted to enchant it. Loki decides to stay at the Void to help Sylvie, instead of returning to the TVA with Mobius. Mobius offers the other Lokis a chance to leave the Void, but they state that the Void is their home and refuse the offer. When Loki asks them about Alioth, they reply that they managed to survive so far and will continue to do so. After the others left, Loki and Sylvie wait for a branched timeline to appear, but Loki realizes that they won't have time to wait and signs to Sylvie that he will create a distraction for Alioth. Loki uses his magic to ignite the sword Kid Loki gave him to call Alioth's attention while Sylvie is trying to enchant it. However, this fails and the creature moves towards Sylvie's direction, making Loki run in a desperate attempt to call Alioth and save her. \n\n[[File:Alioth is enchanted - Loki EP5.png|thumb|left|250px|Alioth is enchanted by Sylvie and Loki.]]\n\nSuddenly, Sylvie is saved when Alioth changes its direction to consume the perfect illusion of [[Asgard]] that is being projected by Classic Loki, who returned to help the pair. While Alioth devours Asgard's illusion, Sylvie takes Loki's hand and tells him that they are going to try to enchant the creature together. Classic Loki eventually becomes tired and his illusion starts to fade, allowing Alioth to find him. Despite this, Classic Loki has no regrets and laughs that he found his \"glorious purpose\" while Alioth engulfs him. Right after, Alioth moves towards Sylvie and Loki, but the pair manages to enchant him just in time. The creature's eyes and mouth glow green from the enchantment and its clouds dissipate, revealing the [[Citadel at the End of Time]], the home of the creator of the TVA.\n\n[[File:He Who Remains and Alioth - Loki EP6.png|thumb|right|250px|He Who Remains tells Loki and Sylvie about when he weaponized Alioth.]] \n\nIn the [[For All Time. Always.|final episode]] of the season, when Loki and Sylvie finally find the creator of the TVA, [[Kang#He Who Remains|He Who Remains]], he tells them the story behind the founding of the TVA and about the Multiversal War that almost led to the destruction of the multiverse and all its timelines. He explains that he harnessed the power of Alioth after one of his Variants found the creature. He Who Remains weaponized Alioth and used it to put an end to the war that was happening because of his own Variants, before founding the TVA to prune the branches after he reorganized the multiverse into the Sacred Timeline.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAlioth Concept Art.jpg\nAlioth Concept Art 2.jpg\nAlioth Concept Art 3.jpg\nThe Void - Loki EP5.png\nSylvie connects with Alioth EP5.png\nMobius and the Lokis face Alioth - Loki EP5.png\nSylvie and Loki face Alioth - Loki EP5.png\nAlioth - Loki EP5.png\nAlioth comes after Sylvie EP5.jpg\nSylvie and Loki enchant Alioth EP5.png\nAlioth is enchanted - Loki EP5.png\nJourney into Mystery ending.jpg\nHe Who Remains and Alioth - Loki EP6.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Loki characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
