Li'l Bad and Izzy's philosophies are diametrically opposed. Li'l Bad is a pacifist while Izzy is a bully. Izzy constantly tries to prove that being tough is better than being nice and as such is constantly at odds with Li'l Bad.\n\nIzzy's second appearance is in WDC&S #99, though he isn't called by name, his demeanor is the same. Zeb, Izzy's father, and Izzy scheme with Zeke to catch the Three Little Pigs. However, Zeb, Zeke and Izzy get into a brawl and it's up to the Pigs to save Zeke (which they do).\n\nIzzy's final appearance in the USA was in \"Walt Disney Comics & Stories\" in the \"Li'l Bad Wolf\" tale when again Izzy comes to visit. This time everyone thinks the ill-mannered Izzy is Li'l Bad in a new clothing. After Izzy captures one of the pigs, Li'l Bad enlists the aid of the Pigs' own cousin, Raymond Hogg.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nIzzyWolf.png|Izzy Wolf as he appears in the comics\nIzzyZeke.jpg|Izzy Wolf and Zeke Wolf\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|Izzy}}\n*[http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/izzy.html Izzy Wolf - Disney's HooZoo]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolf, Izzy}}\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
