To make matters worse, TV funnyman Mauricio was her co-host for the evening, and he let loose with his zingers. The constant laughter from the audience left Coco humiliated. Coco swore she would get back at everyone. Assuming the identity of the \"Sinister Stylist\", she gathered a group of rejects from beauty school and vowed to give everyone else in the state a bad hairdo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSinister Stylist.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sinister Stylist, The}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
