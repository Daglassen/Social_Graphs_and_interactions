They have to maintain a steady speed or the consistency of the flour will be off.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|What are you up to?] What\u2019s it look like? I\u2019m keeping watch over the windmills. My devoted wife and I stand guard day and night.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> They take shifts with Rhodes being awake at night, while his wife takes over during the day.<ref>{{Cite|She\u2019s not here right now, I mean. It\u2019s more of a...time-sharing sort of thing. My love for her is so powerful that she suggested we take shifts. That way it feels more special when we\u2019re together!|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref>\n\nHe is a friendly man who will speak to {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} if he wishes. Link can ask him about what he is doing, and Rhodes will describe his job for him. In response, Rhodes will return the question.<ref>{{Cite|Funny, that was going to be my question to you! What are you doing skulking around in the dead of night?|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> Link can reply a few different ways: saying he is lost, that he is a thief, or that he is a traveler. Should he say that he is lost, Rhodes will laugh and say that everyone is lost to some extent. <ref>{{Cite|[I\u2019m lost.] Hahaha, really? Well, they say everyone is lost in the woods of life. Or words to that effect.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> However, he then points him to the {{Term|BotW|Ton Pu Inn|link}} so Link can have somewhere to stay the night.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Blue|inn}} is down the hill, past the bridge. They\u2019ve got soft beds and reasonable rates there if you want a night\u2019s sleep.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> Rhodes will refer to him as the \"lost boy\" afterward.<ref>{{Cite|Well hello there, lost boy.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> If Link says he is a thief, Rhodes takes it as a game.<ref>{{Cite|[I\u2019m a thief.] Haha, you want to play guards and bandits? Sure, OK. \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest!\u201d Satisfied?|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> He will tease Link about it when spoken to again.<ref>{{Cite|Uh-oh, it\u2019s the robber man! Hide your jewels and heirlooms!|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> When Link admits that he is a traveler, Rhodes is fairly uninterested as he does not consider the hero a threat.<ref>{{Cite|[I\u2019m a traveler.] Are you, now. Well, that\u2019s fine. You seem harmless enough.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt 9 o'clock in the evening, he heads out to the tree for his round of watching the windmills.<ref>{{Cite|Hello and good evening. It\u2019s about time I started work...|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> Once 5 o'clock in the morning rolls around, Rhodes goes home to rest.<ref>{{Cite|Hey there. It\u2019s bedtime for me. I spend nights working, so I have to get my sleep in where I can.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hateno Villagers, Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
