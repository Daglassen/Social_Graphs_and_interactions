== Biography ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===
Cotera is a Great Fairy living in the West Necluda region near Kakariko Village. Like the other Great Fairies, Cotera will upgrade Link's Armor in exchange for Materials. According to Dorian, Cotera is also said to be a guardian spirit of Kakariko Village, though few remain in the village who know of her.
Cotera is at least 10,000 years old, as she was around during the first Great Calamity and soon after watched over the construction of Kakariko Village.
When first meeting Cotera, she is cocooned in a thorny flower bud and begs Link to listen as she explains her sad state. If he agrees, she introduces herself and tells him about her home. A lack of travelers and offerings have left her utterly drained, giving her no choice but to ask for Link's help. She requests several Rupees from Link. The number changes based on how many Great Fairies Link has already helped. Cotera assures Link that she will aid him once she is back to her old self and extends a hand from the bud to accept his offering. Should Link refuse to help her, she retracts her hand with disappointment.
Once Link gives her the appropriate amount of Rupees, Cotera thanks him and is able to regain her power. She bursts from the renewed Great Fairy Fountain completely refreshed, expressing her joy. To thank him for his part in her rejuvenation, Cotera offers her assistance to Link in the form of enhancing his Armor.
How much Cotera will be able to enhance Link's Armor depends on how many of her sisters have been assisted. Whenever Cotera uses her power, she urges Link to allow her to handle the work. Cotera will occasionally mention set bonuses when she enhances Link's clothing, pointing out how they work. Once Link decides to stop, Cotera will mention her sisters and request that he help them as well.
