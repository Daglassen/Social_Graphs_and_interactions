Hades sent Memnon to lose a battle with Achilles, who turned from a has-been hero, in order to make the latter look good as a true hero and push Hercules and Phil apart. However, when Phil and Hercules ultimately get back together, Hades turns Achilles sends Memnon to kill the hero and trainer. Memnon tries smashing Hercules or breathing fire on him, but the young hero-in-training was able to defeat the dragon by tripping him with his own tail.
