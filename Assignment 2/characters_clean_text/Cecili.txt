Cecili is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Cecili is a Rito who manages the Swallow's Roost Inn at Rito Village. She greets Link as he enters and will thank him for stopping by. If Link speaks to her at night, she'll remark that only Stalkoblins have a reason to be up so late. If Link refuses a bed at the Inn, she tells him to stop by whenever he's feeling tired.
Swallow's Roost offers two options for visiting travelers: the standard bed and the Rito-down bed. When asked, Cecili explains that a Rito-down bed is made using Rito feathers, and she claims if Link sleeps on it, he'll never want to sleep on a stable bed again. If Link doesn't wake up full of energy, she guarantees that she'll eat her own tailfeathers.
When Link agrees to sleep at the Inn, Cecili will ask when he wants to be woken. If Link asks to be woken in the morning or at noon, she wishes him sweet or pleasant dreams. If he wants to be woken at night, though, she tells him to rest up.
Cecili will greet Link when he wakes up. In the morning, she hopes he slept well. At noon, she informs him that the sun has been up for some time. During the night, she asks how he slept and wonders what his reason for getting up in the middle of the night is. However, if Link purchased the Rito-down bed, she asks how it was and if he's feeling fully rested. She tells Link to take care as he leaves.
