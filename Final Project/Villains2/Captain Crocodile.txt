He first appears in the film's opening credits and is later seen\u00a0at the archery tournament, where\u00a0he comes up to Prince John and tells him that, with his royal permission, they are ready to begin the tournament. Prince John tells the Captain to proceed, and the\u00a0Crocodile announces, \"The tournament of the Golden Arrow will now begin.\"\n\nAfter all the archers shoot their arrows, the Captain announces that the final contestants are the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] and the \"Spindle-Legged Stork\" from Devonshire (who is actually [[Robin Hood]] in disguise). The Crocodile also orders to have the target moved back 30 paces, to which it is by [[Trigger and Nutsy|Nutsy]]\u00a0(who was hiding inside the\u00a0target to help the Sheriff cheat to win). The Sheriff shoots his arrow while Nutsy adjusts the target so that the Sheriff gets a bull's-eye. When the \"stork\" shoots, the Sheriff nudges the \"stork's\" bow in an attempt to have him miss. However, the \"stork\" manages to shoot another arrow and make the previous one land on the exact same spot, where it knocks the Sheriff's arrow off. As the crowd celebrates the \"stork's\" victory, Prince John makes a pointing gesture to the Captain. The Crocodile winks in confirmation and then whispers something into one of the [[Rhino Guards|Rhino Guard]]'s ear, most likely ordering him to gather the other guards into surrounding the \"stork,\" which they do seconds later.\n\nWhen the \"stork\" is revealed to be Robin Hood, a huge battle erupts in which the Captain fights swords with Robin Hood and almost gets hit by [[Trigger and Nutsy|Trigger]]'s arrow, but he luckily manages to use his shield to protect himself. The Crocodile then begins to announce something, but is run over by a group of Hippos and Rhino Guards under a tent.\n\nThe Captain appears again during the prisoners' escape scene. He tries to stop an old owl couple from escaping by hitting them with his axe, but he misses (thanks to [[Friar Tuck]]) and they manage to escape. He also tries to stop Robin Hood from escaping by knocking the gates down with his axe, but Robin Hood luckily manages to escape as well. The Captain isn't seen after this.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nCaptain Crocodile made occasional cameos with the Rhino Guards in ''[[House of Mouse]]''. He was usually seen in a piece of stock animation where, whenever the guests are driven to leave the [[House of Mouse (night club)|titular nightclub]], they storm through the front hall, trampling over [[Donald Duck]] (like in Stolen Cartoons)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Captain Crocodile has a similar character design from [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile]] in ''[[Peter Pan]]''.\n*His appearance resembles [[Ben Ali Gator]] from ''[[Fantasia]]''.\n*[[Billy Bletcher]] was considered to voice Captain Crocodile. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRobinhood-disneyscreencaps com-4359.jpg\nRobinhood-disneyscreencaps com-4367.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-4565.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-4566.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-4567.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-4568.jpg\nRobinhood-disneyscreencaps com-4678.jpg\nRobinhood-disneyscreencaps com-4740.jpg\nRobinhood-disneyscreencaps com-4841.jpg\nRobinhood-disneyscreencaps com-4849.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5438.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5437.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5434.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5433.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5431.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5429.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5451.jpg\nrobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps_com-5365.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-5383.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-5384.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-5385.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-5386.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5473.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5475.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-5477.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-8938.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-8941.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-8943.jpg\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-9018.jpg\nVery_old_reused_animations.PNG|Captain Crocodile in ''[[House of Mouse]]''\nCaptain Croc- concept art01.jpg\nCaptain Croc- concept art02.jpg\nCaptain Croc- concept art03.jpg\nclipgoldarrow.gif\n</gallery>\n\n{{Robin Hood}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Crocodiles]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
