The pack is led by\u00a0Reirei\u00a0and includes her\u00a0mate\u00a0and\u00a0pups, including\u00a0Dogo\u00a0and\u00a0Kijana.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== [[The Kupatana Celebration]] ===\nReirei\u00a0uses her son\u00a0Dogo\u00a0to gain access to the\u00a0Pride Lands. Once there, she feigns naivety on the ways of the Pride Landers in an attempt to feast on all manner of foods and creatures. She manages to persuade Kion into allowing her into\u00a0Kupatana, where she and her pack cause havoc before Simba orders them to leave.\n\n=== [[Too Many Termites]] ===\nReirei and Goigoi discover some\u00a0aardwolves\u00a0living next door to them after being accidentally kicked out by the Lion Guard. They try to soothe\u00a0Mjomba's Pack\u00a0and get their guard down, but the Lion Guard arrive to right their wrong just in time, saving the aardwolves from the two jackals.\n\n=== [[Babysitter Bunga]] ===\nReirei and her pack attack\u00a0Muhimu's Herd\u00a0as a training course for Dogo and\u00a0Kijana, but they are quickly stopped by the Lion Guard and told by Kion to leave, which they do. They return to the Outlands and partake in some more training, and Reirei decides that her kids are ready to return to the Pride Lands.\n\nWhen they reach the Pride Lands, they end up at the\u00a0Watering Hole, where they find the adults relaxing. After overhearing\u00a0Muhimu\u00a0speak of their little ones being at\u00a0Hakuna Matata Falls, the pack quickly make a move over there, leaving Goigoi to deal with the bulk of the Lion Guard.\n\nWhen they reach the falls, they attack the kids while Reirei stops Bunga from interfering. But since he taught them\u00a0Teke Ruka Teleza, they easily fend the jackals off. When the rest of the Guard catches up to them, Kion orders Reirei and her pack to never attack\u00a0Pride Lander\u00a0kids ever again to which she agrees. After seeing their numbers, the jackals flee back into the Outlands.\n\n== Gallery\u00a0==\n{{Gallerylink}}{{The Lion King}}[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Jackals]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
