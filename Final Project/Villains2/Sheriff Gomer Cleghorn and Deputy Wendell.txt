With his less-than-smart cohort and deputy Wendell, he forces any passersby to work in the mines on trumped-up charges, and even imprisons them.\n\nWhen Wendell and Cleghorn first happen upon the [[Sea Duck]] in their Broncos, Wendell tells [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] to pull over. When Baloo fails to comply, Wendell takes out one of the plane's engines with a nugget of highly volatile urgonium. Cleghorn, as the judge, charges Baloo, [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]], and [[Wildcat]] with speeding, littering, and resisting arrest over the city limits. That's when [[Clementine Clevenger]] cuts in, telling Cleghorn that he's just a worker of Khan Industries, and he's made a habit of snatching up people to work as miners.\n\nWhen one of the miners tells Mr. Khan about the urgonium, Cleghorn and Wendell try to make a getaway in their Bronco. Wildcat and Kit start throwing rotten kumquats at the sheriff and his deputy. One of the kumquats hits the propeller of their flying machine. With the propeller all gummed up, the flying machine plummets to the ground.\n\nIn the aftermath, Clementine is made the new foreman, while Gomer and Wendell end up working in the mines.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is possible that the two were named after [[Country Bear Jamboree]] characters [[Gomer]] and [[Wendell]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nWendell slingshot.jpg|Wendell fires his slingshot\nClementine004.jpg\nJudgegomer.jpg\nClementine018.jpg\nClementine044.jpg\nClementine048.jpg\nClementine092.jpg|Cleghorn catches Clementine\n495975-vlcsnap 00354.jpg\nGomernwendellwhatshedo.jpg\ngummedpropeller.jpg|Wendell and Cleghorn about to take a fall\nTalespin - 141 - citizen kahn Video - Rediff Videos.jpg|Cleghorn and Wendell's defeats\n</gallery>\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Sheriffs]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Judges]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
