They are ghostly, non-speaking, shadowy, dragon-like beings that operate as foot soldiers for [[the Dark Dragon]]. Though neither particularly strong, intelligent, nor resilient, their basic power of numbers allow them to be a regular challenge. Due to their shadowy composition, they are susceptible to light.<ref>[[The Hong Kong Longs]]</ref>\n\n==Friends==\n*[[The Dark Dragon]] (Master)\n*[[Councilor Chang|Chang]]\n*[[Bananas B.]]\n\n==Enemies==\n*[[Jake Long]]\n*[[Haley Kay Long]]\n*[[Susan Long]]\n*[[Jonathan Long]]\n*[[Sun Park]]\n*[[Fu Dog]]\n*[[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]]\n*[[The Dragon Council|Dragon Council]]\n*[[Arthur \"Spud\" P.
