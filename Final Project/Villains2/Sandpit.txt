(TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]''.\n\n==During Phobos's reign==\nSandpit is a living pit that any victims walk over and swallows them, imprisoning them. It also helped Phobos capture rebel members. He has no distinct personality and can not talk. Sandpit first appeared in \"[[Ambush at Torus Filney]]\" capturing [[Caleb]] after going for a false story about the [[Seal of Phobos]]. The Guardians managed to save Caleb from the pit's grasp. [[Irma Lair|Irma]] and [[Taranee Cook|Taranee]] combined their powers to transform Sandpit into a shiny glass lake.\n\n==Knights of Vengeance and His Reformation==\nIn \"[[A is for Anonymous]]\", when [[Nerissa Crossnic|Nerissa]] is starting to form a group of Knights, she visits Sandpit and through the power of Quintessence, Sandpit came back to life and worked for Nerissa. Since coming back to life, he is now a tall new humanoid form that is free to wander. He is joined the Knights of Vengeance, mainly using his powers to make sure the Knights to safety and using his sand to blindside or knock-over the enemies. Sandpit proved to be a useful member as he could disguise himself as a solid object in Earth, as seen in \"[[C is for Changes]]\" and \"[[I is for Illusion]]\" when he helps Miranda and Nerissa with their schemes.\n\nIn \"[[J is for Jewel]]\", Sandpit helps [[Raythor]] and [[Miranda]] release Prince Phobos and using his transparent abilities to unlock the gate for the Knights to escape. [[Elyon Brown|Elyon]] is able to defeat Phobos and the Knights, and Sandpit is trapped in a container so he can not escape at any cost. When Phobos breaks his oath and attacks Meridian, freeing his minions, including Sandpit, the giant humanoid sand monster is convinced by Raythor to join the good guys, the Guardians.\n\nSandpit decides to and helps the rebels during the Battle of [[Kandrakar]]. He is most useful in helping Caleb, [[Blunk]] and Luba stop Miranda from destroying the Aurameres by knocking her out. When Elyon returns to Meridian, Sandpit becomes one of her Castle Guards.\n{{Template:W.I.T.C.H}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
