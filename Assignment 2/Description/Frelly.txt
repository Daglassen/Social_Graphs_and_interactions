When Link speaks to her, Frelly asks if Link crossed the Desert on foot.<ref>{{Cite|Sav'aaq! Oh, wow... Don't tell me you crossed the Gerudo Desert on foot?|Frelly|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link tells her that he came on foot, Frelly comments that it must have been difficult and that it is common sense to travel the Desert with a {{Term|BotW|Sand Seal|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Must have been hard to walk through the desert\u2014especially having your feet sink into the sand.|Frelly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It's common sense to travel the desert with {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seals}} around here.|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> If Link says he rode there, Frelly is impressed that a {{Term|BotW|Hylian|link}} man has mastered Sand-Seal surfing.<ref>{{Cite|Wow... A Hylian voe who has mastered {{Color|BotW Blue|sand-seal}} surfing?|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> Frelly is speechless, pausing for a moment before saying that it must have been a challenge to catch a Sand Seal.<ref>{{Cite|I didn't think it was possible. I'm speechless! I think I may need a moment... Phew. Anyway...|Frelly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I bet it was a real challenge to catch a {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seal}}, wasn't it?|Frelly|BotW}}</ref>\n\nFrelly then introduces herself and explains that she rents out trained Sand Seals for people who do not have the time to train their own.<ref name=\"Shop\"/><ref>{{Cite|Most people can't take the time to train their own {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seals}}, so I rent out the ones I've trained!|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> She assures Link that she can answer any questions about Sand Seals and that she is skilled at training them.<ref>{{Cite|If you need to know anything about {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seals}}, I should be your first stop.|Frelly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|If you have any questions about {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seals}}, come talk to me.

The trick is to approach very, very slowly...|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> However, she points out that most Gerudo just rent a Sand Seal to avoid the hassle of catching one.<ref>{{Cite|It's a pain in the neck, though, so most Gerudo just end up renting one instead.|Frelly|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link asks how to ride a Sand Seal, Frelly tells him that Link needs a {{Term|BotW|Shield|link}} and that Sand Seals will simply go in whatever direction Link steers.<ref>{{Cite|Steering a {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seal}} is really easy\u2014they'll go in whatever direction you want. But!|Frelly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You need a {{Color|BotW Red|shield}} to sand-seal surf, so don't forget about that.|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> She recommends that the best way to learn is to try it.<ref>{{Cite|Just giving it a shot is best, but if there's anything you don't get, let me know!|Frelly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You know, the best way for you to learn how to do this is by just doing it!|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> Frelly also tells Link to come by her shop in Gerudo Town to rent a Sand Seal if he has trouble catching one,<ref>{{Cite|If you're having a hard time catching one, come by my shop in Gerudo Town. I rent out sand seals and...oh.|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> but quickly remembers that men are not allowed inside the Town.<ref>{{Cite|You're a voe... My shop is inside the town walls, so you won't be able to get in...|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> If Link is wearing the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Set|link}}, Frelly tells Link to look for the big Sand Seal statue to find her shop in Gerudo Town.<ref>{{Cite|My shop in Gerudo Town has a big {{Color|BotW Blue|sand-seal statue}} on it. Just look for that, and you'll find me!|Frelly|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Frelly at her Sand-Seal Rental Shop booth, she says that Sand Seals are the best way to cross the Gerudo Desert and offers Link a Sand Seal rental for 20 {{Plural|BotW|Rupee|link}} or 50 Rupees for a {{Term|BotW|Wooden Shield|link}} as well, should he not have any shields.<ref>{{Cite|Vasaaq! If you are hoping to cross the vast Gerudo Desert, {{Color|BotW Blue|sand-seal}} surfing is the way to do it!|Frelly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It's only {{Color|BotW Red|20 rupees}} to rent one! Need a shield, too? Just pay {{Color|BotW Red|50 rupees}}! What do you say?|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> If Link wishes to rent a Sand Seal, he will tell Frelly to \"seal the deal\", which is a pun that confuses Frelly.<ref>{{Cite|What? Is that some kind of slang? {{Small|I wonder if it's just a thing outside Gerudo Town...}}|Frelly|BotW}}</ref> Frelly herself also uses seal puns, such as telling Link that it would be a \"sealious mistake\" to travel the Desert without a Sand Seal and says \"seal you another time\" when Link rents a Sand Seal.<ref>{{Cite|Anyway... The Gerudo Desert is vast. It'd be a sealious mistake not to take a {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seal}} if you're traveling out of town.|Frelly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Seal you another time!
