Infuriated Zexion engages Riku battle but victory proves beyond his reach with Riku fears the darkness destroyed Kneeling defeat Zexion remarks that after all his protests was still the side darkness Riku responds that knows who and Zexion getting his feet asks when that happened since was always scared the dark before Riku angrily states that wasn anymore before lunging Zexion striking him again Gasping Zexion manages retreat through corridor darkness thoroughly defeated Riku reverts back normal now comfortable with his dark powers reaches the second basement Riku hears Ansem voice calling him again saying that knows can feel the grip has his heart and that now that let the darkness his heart will soon become all consuming darkness Riku denies being like that and Ansem dismisses his denial before binding him preventing him from moving muscle says that with how much had let the darkness controlling him was effortless Ansem efforts are diverted when familiar sphere light appears from the ceiling and enters into Riku bright light fills the room Ansem curses Mickey for interfering again and the light fades Riku falls down while Mickey states that was glad made time and that ought keep Ansem busy for while Looking Riku sees Mickey standing there not merely illusion but the flesh Riku touches his face sure that real and expresses how happy that could make there The king reminds him that made promise and looks concern Riku falls over Riku says that all right only relieved had been alone for long that having someone else around was little overwhelming thinks more asks
