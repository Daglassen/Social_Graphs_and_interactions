They move to the beat of the music and share the same beat pattern as the other {{Plural|CoH|Moblin|link}}, moving on every other beat, having to crouch for one beat before hopping to an adjacent tile on the second beat. When they're close enough, they will throw a spear at the heroes, stopping on one beat to aim, throwing it on the second, and letting it land on the third beat. Afterwards, they will try to retrieve their weapon until it is either destroyed or picked up by another Moblin or even the hero if they are using the {{Term|CoH|Power Glove|link}}. Once they lose their spear, they will try to look for another one or if there are none, try to attack the heroes head on. Their spears are the second-strongest, dealing 3 {{Term|CoH|Heart|link}}s of damage to any enemy that get hit by them, being second to only the {{Term|CoH|Purple Moblin|link}} spear in terms of power. During the events of [[Symphony of the Mask]], Black Skull Moblins appear but otherwise act the same as in the main game.\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Stub|HWAoC}}\nBlack Moblins reappear in {{HWAoC}} first appearing in [[The Road Home, Besieged]].
