It was preserved in tree sap millions of years ago underneath the town of [[Gravity Falls (location)|Gravity Falls]], [[Oregon]] before emerging in modern day.\n\n\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn the [[Gravity Falls Title Theme|opening theme]], a picture of the pterodactyl can be seen in a photo.\n\nIn \"[[Land Before Swine]]\", the pterodactyl abducts [[Waddles]] from his owner [[Mabel Pines]]. The Pines family and [[Old Man McGucket]] go after him. It can also be seen ripping off the roof of the cop car and flying by the moon.\n\nAs reported in an article by [[Toby Determined]], the pterodactyl snatched sheep in the past. Also, Toby Determined has reported that the pterodactyl had abducted several local miners. This is proven by the human bones and miner helmets found in the pterodactyl's nest.\n\nT<span>he </span>Pterodactyl<span> </span>makes a cameo in \"[[Weirdmageddon Part 1]]\" where it is seen biting one of the letters off from the mall sigh before flying away.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It was partly animated by [[James Baxter]], former animator for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]].\n*The name \"pterodactyl\" is not the correct term for the animal, it is actually \"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteranodon pteranodon]\".\n*There is also a fake pterosaur in the [[The Mystery Shack|Mystery Shack]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nStan-vs-pterodactyl.png\nS1e18_ahhhh.png\nPterodactylgravityfalls.PNG\nStan-with-pterodactyl.jpg\ntumblr_mouunl5Bch1rz7r1io1_1280.jpg\nTumblr_mouunl5Bch1rz7r1io2_1280.png\ntumblr_mouunl5Bch1rz7r1io3_1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pterosaur]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
