He is recognized as the brains behind Lord Hater's reckless brawn, so much so that even the other villains recognize his absence when Lord Hater tries to go it alone. Peepers seems able to hold an impressive grudge, second only to Lord Hater's contempt of Wander. However, he seems to despise Wander and Sylvia primarily for acting as a constant distraction to the Hater Empire's plans to conquer the galaxy; constantly arguing with Lord Hater regarding their waste of time and resources trying to capture/destroy the two.\n\nPeepers is both under-appreciated by the overlord and overworked. He is also very strict with his fellow Watchdogs, who are far less competent than he is. But despite their bickering, Lord Hater is Peepers' closest friend, and Peepers on occasion has been shown to grow extremely jealous when Lord Hater has brushed him off for his own attention from characters such as Lord Dominator. Though Peepers and Sylvia are enemies, they are often able to put their differences aside in order to help each other save Wander and Lord Hater from whatever trouble they may be in.\n\nIt's been suggested that he may have a Napoleon complex, as he's been teased by the likes of Emperor Awesome for being very small in stature and is elated when gifted with a pair of elevator shoes.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nPeepers is a [[Watchdogs|Watchdog]], a creature with a large eye for a head with a red/purple iris. He has a lightning bolt mark on his black uniform and wears red gloves and shoes. Despite his resemblance to the common Watchdog, he outranks them by the pointed helmet on his head which the other Watchdogs lack, which gives him an aggressive look.\n\nPeepers has pink skin beneath his uniform and is very physically fit for his size.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Peepers' voice actor, [[Tom Kenny]], did voice work for [[Craig McCracken]]'s previous projects ''The Powerpuff Girls'' and ''Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nPeepers.jpg\nPeepers in Wander Over Yonder theme song.png|Commander Peepers standing on top of a blob-like king in the theme song\nLord Hater - The Picnic 1.png\nLord Hater - The Picnic 2.png\nLord Hater - The Picnic 3.png\nLord Hater - The Picnic 4.png\nLord Hater - The Picnic 5.png\nPeepers on Wander's back.png|Peepers standing on Wander's back.\nWander Over Yonder character concept art.jpg\nLord Hater and Peepers float.png\nWander banjo solo Peepers tied up.jpg|Peepers all tied up\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n[[ru:\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441]]\n\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Commanders]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
