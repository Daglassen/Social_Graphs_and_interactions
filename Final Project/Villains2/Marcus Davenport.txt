He revealed himself to be a truly dark and mean character who is ruthless and manipulative for a reason, and will not let Leo to mess up his plans and stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Despite this he creates a believable facade of being a friend. He only revealed his true personality to Leo.\n\n==Family==\n\n*[[Douglas Davenport]] (father/creator)\n*Donald Davenport (uncle)\n*[[Leo Dooley]] (step-cousin)\n*[[Adam Davenport]] (brother)\n*[[Bree Davenport]] (sister)\n*[[Chase Davenport]] (brother)\n*Daniel Davenport (brother)\n*Tasha Davenport (aunt)\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n\n*'''Strength, Speed, Intellect:''' Marcus has all of the powers from all of the Lab Rats, including Leo.\n*'''Laser Vision''': Just like Adam, Marcus has laser vision. However, his differs from Adam in numerous ways. His vision is green, and his laser vision can destroy things, unlike Adam's, who's vision can only melt things. This is a very powerful ability, as a single laser was able to destroy his giant robot in Leo vs. Evil.\n*'''Molecularkinesis''': Marcus has the power to move objects with his mind, exactly like Chase's ability.\n*'''Plasma Grenade''': He uses a plasma grenade on Adam, Bree and Chase and incapacitates them.\n*'''Bionic Energy Blast:''' Marcus has an ability to release a green gaseous energy that is enough to knock out a person for hours. He used this ability on Donald Davenport in Bionic Showdown.\n*'''Psychological Manipulation Skills''': Ever since his first appearance, he lied and fooled the Lab Rats into believing he is a innocent troubled boy, revealing only to Leo that he is actually a sinister bionic villain.\n*'''Super Intelligence''': It is very probable that Marcus has super intelligence because he said that he made the upgraded weapons on the remote controlled home security robot.\n*'''Lighting Manipulation''': Marcus can harness lightning in his palm and use it as a weapon. It is presumably powerful enough to kill a person.\n*'''Super Strength''': Marcus easily overpowered Adam and was able to lift and throw him.\n*'''Super Speed''': Marcus is even faster than Bree, being able to dodge her high speed attacks with ease.\n*'''Invisible Force-Field''': Marcus was shown capable of making a force-field to block the laser that Donald fired at him. Unlike Chase's force-field, which is a dome, Marcus's is shown to be like an invisible shield.\n*'''Super Durability''': Marcus easily shrugged off all of Adam, Bree and Chase's attacks and is shown to be able to take immense amounts of damage.\n*'''Martial Arts''': Marcus can easily hold his own against Adam, Bree and Chase in hand-to-hand combat.\n*'''Saw Fingers''': He tried to kill Leo with spinning saws that come out of his hand in Bionic Showdown.\n*'''Wi-Fi Hotspots''': He has a mole on the back of his neck that is actually a Wi-Fi Hotspot.\n*'''Super Hearing''': He and Chase were the only ones to cover their ears when Bree was playing guitar.\n\n* '''Laser Sphere Generation:''' Similar to Leo, Marcus can generate a laser sphere in the palm of his hand. Unlike Leo's orbs, which are orange, Marcus's orbs are cyan with sparks coming out of it.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n=== Season One Episodes===\n\n*Concert in a Can\n*Mission: Space\n\n===Season Two Episodes ===\n\n*Speed Trapped\n*Leo vs Evil\n*Bionic Showdown\n\n===Season Four Episodes===\n\n*Bionic Action Hero (android hand only)\n*The Vanishing\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Marcus has all of the powers used by the Lab Rats, and knew that they were bionic long before the events of You Posted What!?\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBree_and_marcus.jpg\nJijimage.jpg\nQimage.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davenport, Marcus}}\n[[Category:Lab Rats characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
