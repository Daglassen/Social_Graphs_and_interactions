== Biography ==
Calisa is a Gerudo who travels throughout the Gerudo Region carrying a Gerudo Scimitar and a Gerudo Shield. She can be found at the Gerudo Canyon Stable and the Kara Kara Bazaar, and she also traverses the Gerudo Desert. Calisa is a legendary treasure hunter, searching for both treasure and men. She has been treasure hunting for twenty year, so she is sure she can acquire any treasure she sets her eyes on.
While at the Gerudo Canyon Stable, Calisa tells Link that she is looking for men at the Stable. She says that she would not rate any of the men as treasure except for Link. Calisa also mentions that she aims to dig up the buried Treasure Chests in the Gerudo Desert and find out what is inside them. Calisa wishes that she had a Sand Seal to cross the desert with ease.
Calisa also asks Link how he has such strength and endurance from his runty body. She tells Link to keep an eye out for the leviathan bones in the desert as well. While at the Kara Kara Bazaar, Calisa comments that the whole town has been talking about the Yiga Clan.
While in the Gerudo Desert, Calisa tells Link about a rumor of a great treasure buried in the sands. Calisa is also surprised that a runt like Link wants to cross the desert.
If Enemies approach Calisa, she will exclaim that she could defeat the monsters if she was a few years younger. If Link defeats the monsters, she rewards him with a Spicy Meat and Seafood Fry.
