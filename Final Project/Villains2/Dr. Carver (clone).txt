He is a clone of the real and kind [[Dr. Carver]], but he left his clone out in the sun too long and had him horribly disfigured, resulting in him disguising himself as Carver. Because of his disfiguration, the clone started to do evil things, and have the real Dr. Carver's peanut people work for him by force (except Wally). He was planning to rule the world by making muscular peanut men, known as Super G-nomes, but they were unstable and kept degrading into peanut butter. When he found out about Oscar's Everlasting Multiplying formula for his Proud Snacks, he invited him and his family to Legume Island on a vacation getaway. However, since Oscar won't reveal where he keeps the formula, even after being offered $10 million, Dr. Carver sends peanut clones of the Proud Family to wreak havoc back home.\n\n\n\n==Backstory==\nBefore the events of the film, he was made in the lab by the real Dr. Carver. Unfortunately, after being in the sun for too long, he got burnt into a crisp, went bad, and declared revenge as he ran off. He covered his entire appearance with a plastic body (explaining the recurring gag with his nose). Dr. Carver forced almost all the peaceful peanut people to work for him, except for Wally (who continued working for the original) and (later) Cashew.\n\n==Role==\nAt the beginning, he and Cashew were seen in the lab on Legume Island trying to create a Super G-nome warrior; unfortunately for Carver, the Super G-nomes were unstable and turned into peanut butter instead. At W.A.S.T.E., he noticed that Oscar Proud had a formula that could multiply several nuts, and he planned on getting it for his evil plan, believing that it could possibly stabilize the Super G-nome warriors and prevent them from turning into peanut butter.\n\nIn order to do so, he had the Proud family invited to Legume Island and disguised it as a family vacation. Later at his estate, he offered Oscar $10 million for the formula; however, he didn't exactly bring it with him or said where it was. After putting Oscar in a few ways of comedic torture, he created peanut clones of the entire family, by using personal items that were stolen during the luau, to retrieve the formula outside the island. The clones are identical to the original but possess superhuman strength. The real Penny ends up going home with the cloned Proud family while the clone Penny remains with the original family.\n\nLater, Clone Penny informed Dr. Carver about the whereabouts of the Proud family, Wally, and the real Dr. Carver, who had been unaware that she was actually a clone. After he finally got the formula, he experimented and successfully created the Super G-nome warriors. To get rid of his prisoners, he tried to get them eaten by his sea monster; however, the monster noticed the real Carver and after forgiving him for a past incident and realizing that Carver had missed them, he decided to become an ally and not kill them.\n\nDuring the climax, Dr. Carver was seen on a blimp and announced to the stuffball crowd (and probably every location) that he was about to take over the world. He took off his face mask and revealed his true face. Penny and Carver fought on the blimp for the Peanut Liquification gas. Afterwards, Penny released the gas and turned the Super G-nome warriors into peanut butter. In the end, the gas affected him as he fell off the blimp, causing him to turn back into a regular little peanut and fall in the ocean.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\neG5kbm1wMTI= o the-proud-family-movie-part-2.jpg\nTPFM OscarPenny confused.JPG\nDr. Carver as a Pirate.jpg|Dr. Carver disguised as a pirate\nOscar and Dr. Carver Movie.jpg|Dr. Carver with Oscar Proud\nGIVE IT, GIVE IT GIVE IT!!!.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-07-09-15h54m52s33.png\n6fadcb621aa24bb941dd3ef4c0f3e6e4.jpg|Dr. Carver's clone with Suga Mama\n0118.jpg\nt ffb7055c4a004ad58243e50c65ada043.jpg\nDr. Carver timid hot tub.jpg\nDouble Dr. Carver.png\nDr Carver clone menacing look.jpg\nGlare clone Dr. Carver.jpg\nClone evil look Carver.png\nClone Dr. Carver peanut army.png\nDouble Carver peanuts.JPG\nIf I rule the world.jpg\ntumblr lsmlvnC43U1qzh4iso1 500.png|Dr. Carver unmasked showing his true burned self\n7 the proud family-2010-08-15-0.jpg\nI'm A Little Peanut - YouTube2.jpg|The defeat of the clone Dr. Carver--transformed into a tiny peanut. \n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carver, Dr.}}\n{{The Proud Family}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
