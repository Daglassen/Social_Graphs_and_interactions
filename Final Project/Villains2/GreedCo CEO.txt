He hates all children, who he torments with Yang's advertising, until defeated by him. He is mentioned in the episode \"[[The Howl of the Weenie]]\", where\u00a0[[Eradicus]]\u00a0was late to play golf with him. He creates toys to kill children as he used yang to sell these toys. In the episode \"[[This Yang Isn't Brought to You By...]]\", he disguised himself as a kid to convince Yang to \"do the right thing\", which meant to him, selling more dangerous toys when Yin told Yang to stop. Unfortunately for Yang, he misunderstood the meaning of what he said and stopped selling the toys. This upset him and he turned back into a devil, attacking Yin and Yang with his huge monster truck. He was defeated by Yin and Yang's Woo Foo Aura.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
