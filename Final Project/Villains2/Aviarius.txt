He is the self-proclaimed \"The Dark Master of the Winged World\".\n\n==History==\nHe is an enemy of [[Team Go]] with an extensive collection of bird minions and bird-based gadgets such as the \"Flamingo of Doom\" and the \"Heat-Seeking Hummingbirds.\" His secret lair, \"the Nest,\" lies upon the peak of Go Mountain, just outside of Go City. He imprisoned the [[Wego Twins|Wego twins]] there and stole their powers in an attempt to lure [[Shego]] and [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] (who Aviarius had accidentally transferred the powers of [[Hego]] to) to his lair to steal their powers as well and from that point own \"the complete set\" of Team Go's powers.\n\n==Trivia==\n* He is likely a parody of the ''Spider-Man'' villain Adrian Toomes, AKA the Vulture.\n*With his bird theme weaponry and appearance, Aviarius is similar to Penguin from Batman's rogue gallery.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n98.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
