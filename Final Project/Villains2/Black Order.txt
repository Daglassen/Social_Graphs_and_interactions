His eldest children were Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, the Zehoberei Gamora and the Luphomoid Nebula. After bringing them into his quest, he trained them in the ways of combat, making deadly warriors out of all of them. \n\nFour of them became unfailingly loyal and devoted to Thanos, using their skills to aid his crusade for the Infinity Stones. All of them had particular sets of abilities that made them formidable and dangerous in their own way. But Gamora and Nebula would eventually resent Thanos; the former having reservations of his goal and the latter of the mistreatment and abuse that was inflicted on her. \n\nIn 2014, he Black Order aided in Thanos' conquest of Korbin and helped in the massacre of its population. After Gamora and Nebula returned, Thanos dispatched them to the Dark Aster to ensure Ronan obtains the Power Stone and that it is brought to Thanos. This caused a setback as Gamora joined the Guardians of the Galaxy and Nebula went rogue.  \n\nThe Black Order went with Thanos in his quest for the Tesseract, the vessel of the Space Stone, which came into Loki's hands after Asgard's fiery demise. They attacked the fleeing Asgardians with the Sanctuary II, defeating Thor and Heimdall, slaughtering half of the population.  \n\nFollowing this, Ebony Maw gave a traditional speech of the Asgardian casualties left in their wake helps restore balance to the universe. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Each member's name references the color black.\n*The telekinetic Supergiant was left out of the MCU adaption.\n\n{{Stub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Guardians of the Galaxy characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:What If...? characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Timeline Versions]]"
