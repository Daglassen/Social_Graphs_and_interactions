It is presumed that Homer also appears in \"Pussy Willie\" and once again as the Ortensia's kid brother in Lantz's \"The Fireman\" (1931).\n\nHomer is a badly behaved and mischievous kitten who often takes advantage of Oswald's kindness, or simply bothers him with pranks. His background and sometimes even his name depends on the short he appears in. Much like [[Ortensia]]'s name and background changed depending on the cartoon short. For example. In \"Homeless Homer\". Homer is an orphaned kitten while in other shorts he is [[Ortensia]]'s bratty little brother.\n\nA number of kittens with a very similar appearance and disposition appeared as Oswald's cat nephews in the Oswald short \"Henpecked\" and again appeared as the antagonists in the Mickey Mouse short: ''[[Mickey's Orphans]]''.\n\n==Appearance in modern comics==\n[[File:Oswald_Ortensia_comic_En_magisk_jul!.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Oswald Ortensia and Homer in \"En magisk jul!\"]]\nHomer makes an surprising return in the Norwegian comic \"En magisk jul!\" (\"Just Like Magic!\"). This marks the first Oswald and [[Ortensia]] appearance in modern Disney comics outside of the Epic Mickey universe and Homer's first outing in more than 70 years.\n\nWritten by David Gerstein and the art by Mark Kausler. It is based and takes place in the times of the classic Oswald shorts from 1927/1928.\n\nIn this comic, Homer is Ortensia's bratty little brother and both have a rich banker father called J. P. Whiskers. Homer wants to embarrass Oswald in front of Ortensia as much as possible. His appearance in this comic confirm his name as Homer in the Disney universe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Homer the Cat's more mature appearance in\u00a0''[[Oh Teacher]]'', in which he's the same size as Oswald, looks a lot like\u00a0[[Julius the Cat]].\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|id=Homer}}\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
