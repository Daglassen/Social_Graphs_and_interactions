To them, the Great Deku Tree is considered a father figure to the children of the forest, for it is him that protects them from evil. One thing that sets the Deku Tree of the [[Great Sea]] apart from his predecessor is that each year, he sends off some of the [[Korok]]s to plant [[Forest Tree]]s throughout the islands. This is done in the hope that, as the forests spread and the trees grew, they will consolidate the remaining land above the Great Sea, and allow some of the land lost during the Great Flood to be reclaimed from the depths.<ref>{{Cite|Every year after the Koroks perform this ceremony, they fly off to the distant islands on the sea and plant my seeds in the hopes that new forests will grow.|Great Deku Tree|TWW}}</ref> It also rejuvenates his power, for if his power were to wane, the life of the Koroks would fade as well.<ref>{{Cite|If we are unable to hold our ceremony, we will not be able to raise any new forests.
