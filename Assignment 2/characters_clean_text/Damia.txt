Damia is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Damia is a Korok that lives in the Korok Forest. After Link starts "The Korok Trials" Side Quest, he can meet with Damia by following the eastern path out of the forest. Damia has been expecting Link and asks if he's ready for the Test of Wood, since it's the hardest of the Korok Trials. He explains that the only thing Link needs to do is equip the Korok weapon set and reach the Ancient Shrine. Damia asks Link if he's ready to attempt the trial. Agreeing initiates the Shrine Quest "The Test of Wood".
Once Link completes the Shrine Quest, Damia congratulates him. He then offers Link another trial, this time with a shorter time limit. If Link can make it within five minutes, Damia promises him a prize. However, he requires a security deposit of 20 Rupees, which covers the cost of gear rental.
If Link agrees, Damia explains that the rules are the same as before. He then goes to set everything up. When Link reaches the Shrine, Damia shouts that he reached the goal. The prize for making it in under five minutes is a Silver Rupee, which Damia hopes Link likes.
When Link breaks his record, Damia asserts that he knew Link would be good at the Test of Wood. He asks Link to let him know if he wants to come back and break his record. If Link is done playing, Damia will take his gear back and return him to the start.
