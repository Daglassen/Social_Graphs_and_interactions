Evidence as he mistakes gangsters as cops and when Big Boy takes everything he owns he is scared and this becomes more apparent when Big Boy tells him that he's going in \"the bath\".\n\n==Role in the film==\nLips is the city's biggest crime boss as he spends his nights at the Club Ritz to eat oysters and listen to [[Breathless Mahoney]]'s songs. Then he was encountered by several police officers who were warranted to arrest him, but as he sees [[Flattop Jones]], he realizes that the cops are really gangsters who take him to an abandoned warehouse by the city's bay where he meets Big Boy, who takes everything he owned and disposes of him by drenching him in cement (called \"The Bath\"). He was presumed dead after he was dropped into the river.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"square\">\nFile:LipsManlis.jpg\nLips (Movie).jpg\ntumblr_mre330FdWw1sd4319o1_500.jpg\n2B7FE068-FD89-4FDC-86F1-8DE19A7722E7.jpeg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manlis, Lips}}\n\n{{Dick Tracy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dick Tracy characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]"
