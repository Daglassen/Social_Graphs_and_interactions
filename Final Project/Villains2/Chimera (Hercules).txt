Meanwhile, [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] is winning every event and enjoying being a hero (or sports hero, as [[Philoctetes|Phil]] calls it) \u2013 until [[Ares]] remembers, in a manner similar to anti-doping, that he is a demigod, and only mortals can compete; hence, half his points are taken off. But when Echidna and her family arrive, he puts aside popularity to save the day, with an assist from Ares and [[Athena]], who are working together for once.\n\nThe Chimera resurfaces in \"[[Hercules and the Pegasus Incident]]\" where it is terrorizing Lycia. It is briefly defeated by [[Pegasus]] and Bellerophon after accidentally swallowing a molten staff. The Chimera is placed inside a petting zoo following its defeat, although it is freed once its cage collapses. After another confrontation with Pegasus and Bellerophon fails to defeat it, Hercules teams up with Pegasus to trick the Chimera into knocking itself out, and is then thrown out of Lycia by Hercules.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nChimera don't actively appear on the show and was implied to be a common species in Fairytale Land. [[King Midas]] kept one of these creatures as a golden statue. At [[Lancelot]]'s village, they can be eaten as food (it looks and tastes like \"one part lion, one part serpent, one part goat\") and their blood is used as an ingredient for the Curse of the Empty Hearted.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Chimera's defeat in \"Hercules and the Pegasus Incident\" is taken from the original myth, in which Bellerophon threw a spear molten by the Chimera's breath down its throat and killed it.\n*In Greek mythology, the Chimera was female and also had the head of a goat or dragon. However, the ''Hercules'' TV series refers to it as a \"he\" at one point.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Chimera}}\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
