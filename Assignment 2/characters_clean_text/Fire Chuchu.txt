Fire Chuchus are enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Fire Chuchus are flaming Chuchus that appear in hot places, such as the Eldin Region. They leave trails of Fire behind them as they move, setting anything flammable on Fire, such as grass or wood. They attack by dashing forward and emitting a blast of Fire around them. If hit by their attack, Link is temporarily set on Fire unless he is wearing the full Flamebreaker Set, which applies the Fireproof Set Bonus. After attacking, Fire Chuchus temporarily lose their fiery coating and become a darker color, leaving them vulnerable to attack. If they are defeated while on Fire, they will explode with a fiery blast. Fire Chuchus drop Red Chuchu Jelly after being defeated.
