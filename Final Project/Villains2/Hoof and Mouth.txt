Both Hoof and Mouth are exceptionally clumsy, and are often physically abused by [[Hammerhead Hannigan|Hammerhead]]. Despite this, they are implied to be murderous, as they apparently killed Gosalyn's grandfather, Professsor Waddlemayer, (although they mistakenly did so ''before'' Bulba could interrogate Waddlmayer in order to learn the Ramrod's arming code). Their combined names are a pun on hoof-and-mouth disease. Mouth was voiced by [[Eddie Deezen]].\n\n==Hoof==\nA lanky, bucktoothed horse with red hair, Hoof is possibly the least intelligent of the three. He wears a green pork pie hat, a red coat covering a white buttoned-up shirt, green pinstripes pants, and large brown shoes (one of which has a hole in the bottom-sole). Hoof is apparently a mute because he never says a single word in either of the episodes he appears in, apart from the occasional grunt and yell (however, he had several lines of dialogue in the comic book adaptation).\n\n==Mouth==\nSlightly smarter than Hoof is Mouth, a ram wearing a red bow tie, a maroon apple cap, a blue coat, gray pants, and small brown shoes. Whereas Hoof is eternally silent, Mouth, conversely, has an apparent speech impediment which makes him talk very rapidly and repeat almost everything he says. He is the smallest of the trio, yet still bigger than [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] as seen during his confrontation with him aboard Taurus' airship.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHoof_henchman.jpg|Hoof\nMouth_henchman.jpg|Mouth\n474651-vlcsnap_00308_super.jpg\n474685-vlcsnap_00461_super.jpg\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h03m49s991.png\nHoof.jpg\n1720661-hoof_mouth_large.png\nEp02-014.png|Hoof and Mouth with Hammerhead, Darkwing\n474678-vlcsnap_00436.jpg\n474635-vlcsnap_00241.jpg\n474687-vlcsnap_00467.jpg\nVlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h20m14s577.png\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h11m50s759.png\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h14m53s082.png\n474837-vlcsnap_00614.jpg\n474856-vlcsnap_00699.jpg\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h20m45s895.png\n474670-vlcsnap_00389.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h30m43s294.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h31m47s107.png|\"Grab onto something!\"\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h30m22s662.png|\"Not me, you lunkheads!\"\nDarkwing Duck - 102 - Darkly Dawns the Duck part 2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Sheep]]"
