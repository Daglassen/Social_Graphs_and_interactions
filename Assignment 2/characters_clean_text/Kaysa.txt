Kaysa is a recurring character in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]


== Biography ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===
Kaysa is a Great Fairy living in the Tabantha Frontier region.  Like the other Great Fairies, Kaysa will upgrade Link's Armor in exchange for Materials.
Kaysa is also the subject of the sidequest "A Gift for the Great Fairy". At the Tabantha Bridge Stable, there is an NPC known as Toren who is determined to locate Kaysa's fountain and meet her. When spoken to, he gives Link a hint as to the fountain's location and 500 Rupees to give to her as an offering. Once Link has spoken to Kaysa and returned to the stable, Toren will thank him for making the journey, but insists when pressed for a reward that being able to meet the Great Fairy is enough recompense, in his view.
Unaware of Toren's infatuation with her, Kaysa immediately becomes smitten with Link when they first meet. After jokingly inviting him to live in her fountain with her, she notes how cute he appears when he blushes at her advances. To that end, she delights in flirting with him as she enhances his armor. Should Link lack the materials for a requested upgrade, Kaysa will playfully chide him for being impatient, whereas declining an available upgrade has her accuse him of attempting to tease her with the prospect.
