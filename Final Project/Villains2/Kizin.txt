He is voiced by Roman Reigns.\n\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nKizin is a giant with green skin and a baby face with large spots on his face and one tooth in his mouth. He has a mushroom on his head.\n\n== Role in the series ==\nKizin is first mentioned in the special 'Realm of the Jaquins', where [[ King Verago|King Verago]] explains why the Jaquins dislike humans entering Vallestrella. Many years ago, humans entered Vallestrella and unearthed Kizin. It was the biggest battle the Jaquins fought, and though they won, there was a great cost.\n\nKizin makes his debut in the episode 'Giant Steps', where [[Chatana]], [[ Ash Delgado |Ash]] and [[Chancellor Esteban |Esteban]] plan to free him to gather forces. With the help of Tziloco, they enter Vallestrella, where Chatana shows Ash and Esteban the mound where Kizin was imprisoned. Ash frees Kizin, who is upset with his 'mother', Chatana for leaving him to be captured. Chatana tries to explain that she was captured and though Kizin takes a liking to Esteban, he refuses to help them and instead goes to free his friends trapped in [[Quita Moz |Quita Moz's]] jars.\n\nEsteban teleports Ash's group away just as [[Princess Elena |Elena's]] group appears. [[Mateo]] recognizes Kizin and warns that his weak spot is his left foot. Elena sends the Jaquins back to bring the King's guard and her group sets out to stop Kizin.\n\nElena's group sets a\u00a0trap for Kizin. Unfortunately, [[Naomi Turner |Naomi]] ruins the trap when she goes after Tziloco. Kizin hurts Elena in a way that breaks her arm and kidnaps [[Gabe]] and Mateo and brings them to Quita Moz's nest. Kizin breaks through the entrance of Quita Moz's nest and gets ready to open the jars that contains his trapped friends. Fortunately, Naomi and Elena arrive in time and Naomi uses a magical bag to trap Kizin inside. Elena's group then plan to put the trapped Kizin in one of Quita Moz's jars.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n20200817 230435.jpg|Chatana showing Ash and Esteban the mound where Kizin was imprisoned.\n20200817 230421.jpg\n20200817 230407.jpg|Ash frees Kizin\n20200818 071849.jpg|\"Mama?\"\n20200818 071513.jpg|\"You left Kizin!\"\n20200818 072013.jpg\n20200818 072027.jpg\n20200818 072102.jpg|\"Stop tickling Kizin!\"\n20200818 072120.jpg|\"Open!\"\n20200818 072136.jpg\n20200818 072201.jpg|\"No Quita?\"\n20200818 072217.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
