He is the founder and CEO of Oscorp Industries and the father of [[Harry Osborn]]. However, upon taking an experimental serum, he became the supervillain known as the Green Goblin. [[Willem Dafoe]] will reprise his role as Green Goblin in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''.\n\nThe Green Goblin was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nNorman Osborn seems to have a calculated mind. He has a extreme distaste for his plans being foiled or executed in a way that is not what he had planned.. He has shown to have lust for power. Overall, he acts like a psychopath.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''Superhuman Strength:''' As the Green Goblin, Norman can easily overpower humans by lifting them up with one hand or by hurling them around.

As shown on many occasions, Norman, as the Green Goblin, can match Spider-Man.\n*'''Superhuman Durability:''' As the Green Goblin, Norman is very resistant to great impact forces and blunt trauma. He can withstand powerful impacts, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhuman enemy, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to himself.\n*'''Genius-Level Intellect:''' Norman is extremely intelligent, was extremely skilled with mathematics and science.

He is transported to the MCU from the Raimiverse by [[Doctor Strange]]'s botched spell.\n\n===[[Marvel Animation]]===\n====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====\nNorman had worked with [[Doctor Octopus]] when Spider-Man came into publicity, intending to market an army of Spider-Man like ability soldiers that he could sell. He was not fond of Nick Fury trying to train him. Octavius asked Norman if he should have The Frightful Four destroy Midtown High, but was quickly declined when Norman revealed that his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] went there.\n\nOsborn ordered Octavius to have something to him by the night of Harry's party, refusing to have to wait for months. Norman arrived at his house after the symbiote had seemingly been destroyed, he was glad Harry wasn't hurt and showed gratitude to Spider-Man. After the incident was averted, Norman arrived in Doctor Octopus' facility and demanded a newly improved Venom.\n\nNorman went to see Doctor Octopus, he ordered him to give him a reason as to why he had yet to explain why he had summoned him there. Osborn felt annoyed by his son Harry, who was trying to explain to him, that he had became the new Spider-Man everyone was talking about, but, Norman stated he did not care unless it was about an improvement in his grades before Harry could get out all of his words. Norman was doing business affairs when all of a sudden Spider-Man and Venom crashed through the window and shattered the glass. Venom expressed anger at Norman for not listening to him as Harry. Norman was called back to Octavius' lab and wrote it off as a waste of his time.\n\nNorman had noticed his son had been acting very rude and disrespectful towards him and asked him to change his tone. Harry transformed into [[Venom]] and threw him out of a window. Spider-Man saved him and Norman briefly thanked him before going off with several of his assistants and coworkers. Norman was tracked by his son and thrown against a wall. Despite this, Norman was marveled at his son's symbiote and ordered Doctor Octopus to make more like it.\n\nAs time went on, Norman grew tired of Doc Ock's stall for time. He mocked Octavius incompetence to capture Spider-Man, but when Octavius finally captured Spider-Man and brought him to his lair while messaging Osborn, Norman was for once proud of him. However when Osborn ordered Octavius to bring Spider-Man to him, Octavius snapped at him and turned his monitor off.\n\nAfter witnessing Octavius defeat by Spider-Man, he fired him from Oscorp and exploded his lab, leaving no evidence behind.\n\nNorman later re-hired Octavius and attempted to find Spider-Man's true identity, but Octavius injected him with a combination of Spider-Man's DNA and Venom's causing him to transform into the Goblin. After seeing Harry, he went after him, but later attacked the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] and made Harry into Venom. Harry shook Venom off to Goblin's disappointment. He then sampled the symbiote and left his own son to die on the Helicarrier.\n\nSoon after, he presumably killed Spider-Man and attacked his son and Peter. He later injected Peter Parker with Venom, which turned him into [[Carnage]]. He then ordered him to defeat Spider-Man's team. After Carnage was defeated, he took it with him, but watched Harry and Peter's car drive away.\n\nLater, S.H.I.E.L.D. caught him at an abandoned warehouse, upgrading his glider. Spider-Man and his team were sent to stop him and quickly defeated him. When he was brought onto the Tri-Carrier, he released the Venom symbiote, which took control of everyone, including himself, on board except for Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus worked together to stop him. While Spider-Man fought him in the Iron Spider armor, Doctor Octopus got to work on an anti-venom serum. Once the anti-venom was done, Spider-Man used it to remove the symbiote off of everyone on board.\n\nWhen the symbiote came off of Green Goblin, he was reverted back to Norman Osborn. Spider-Man then tossed the Venom symbiote into space and destroyed it with a huge repulsor blast. Norman was later taken to a hospital to recover.\n\nAfter getting back to normal life, Norman felt remorseful for his actions as the Green Goblin and decided to make up for it by becoming a superhero himself. He built the [[Iron Patriot (armor)|Iron Patriot armor]] (Iron Man's armor with Captain America's color scheme) to serve a national symbol to emphasize that he was a changed man. Unfortunately, Norman's aggressiveness and control issues carry on to his new career, and make relations with [[Spider-Man]] and his team difficult.\n\n====''[[Spider-Man (TV series)]]''====\n[[File:Norman Osborn (Earth-TRN633) from Marvel's Spider-Man (animated series) Season 1 3 001.png|thumb|right|180px| Norman Osborn in ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'']]\n\nNorman Osborn appears in the 2017 animated series ''Marvel's Spider-Man'' as one of the primary antagonists, aside from the [[Jackal (Marvel)|Jackal]]. He is voiced by [[Josh Keaton]], who ironically enough is best known for voicing Spider-Man himself.\n\nIn this series, Osborn starts a new school called the Osborn Academy for Geniuses as a way of saving his son Harry from the embarrassment after Harry was briefly suspended from Horizon High. However it is later revealed that he hired Spencer Smythe to cause Harry's suspension to push Harry into accepting his offer for the academy. Over the course of the series, Norman recruits future and current Spider-Man rogues to attend or work at Osborn Academy, such as Vulture, Doc Ock, and considering on admitting the Jackal, He works throughout the first season plotting the downfall of the Jackal and the Spider-Men.\n\nIn the \"Spider Island\" story arc, Norman was one of the first victims of Jackal's spider virus and mutates into a man-spider. Having the most exposure to the chemicals gives him more control over the other Man-Spiders as the Spider-King (a role that was Captain America's in the original storyline). In the story arc, \"The Hobgoblin,\" Norman entrusts the Hobgoblin equipment to Harry Osborn in trust that he would destroy Spider-Man, but when Harry refused, Norman donned the Hobgoblin Armour, and tried to destroy Spider-Man himself, and again supposedly died in the process. When Harry resumed control of Oscorp (Not Osborn Academy, because it was destroyed in Spider-Island), Norman was revealed to be alive (in some sort), and reveals a new, deadly project to his son.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the comics, Green Goblin was created after a serum explosion, while in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' series Green Goblin is created after Doctor Octopus injects him with it.\n*The ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Goblin's overall concept is an amalgam of his [[w:c:marvel:Ultimate comics|Ultimate comics]] version's Hulk-like form and his original incarnation's intelligence and technology usage.\n*Unlike his comic counterpart, the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Goblin's Glider was created by S.H.I.E.L.D. rather than himself.\n*''Ultimate Spider-Man's'' incarnation is referred to on-screen as The Goblin rather than Green Goblin, though promotional materials tend to refer to him as \"The Green Goblin\".\n*The 2017 [[Spider-Man (TV series)|''Spider-Man'']] series featured a new identity for the character, known as '''Dark Goblin'''.\n**Dark Goblin's design is based on the Red Goblin, while featuring some influences from the Ultimate comics version.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{USMWiki}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Spidey and His Amazing Friends characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
