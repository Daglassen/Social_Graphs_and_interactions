Hawk (Professor Brainard)<br>Alonzo A. Hawk (''Herbie Rides Again'')}}\n'''Alonzo Hawk''' is the main antagonist of the [[Professor Brainard]] duology and ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]''. He is a diabolical and ruthless businessperson.\n\n==Role in the films==\n===''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]''===\nCredited as Alonzo P. Hawk, he's the main antagonist of the movie. He goes as a banker that initially seeks to demolish the failing [[Medfield College]] to put up a new series of apartment complexes, especially after his son, Biff, is taken off the basketball team for bad grades. When he stumbles upon Ned Brainard's discovery of [[Flubber (character)|Flubber]] after seeing the scientists' flying Model T, he schemes to steal Flubber for monetary gain.\n\nWhen Brainard tries to take Flubber to government officials, Alonzo manages to discredit him by switching out and stealing the flying Model T. When realizing what he's done, Brainard and Betsy go to his house to find the car under the pretense of selling him on the idea of Flubberized shoes. They trick him into trying it out for himself by jumping out the window safely, but he cannot stop bouncing, causing a scene and resulting in the fire department and Medfield's football team working to get him down. He and his men pursue Brainard to his warehouse and engage in a car chase, which results in Hawk's arrest.\n\n===''[[Son of Flubber]]''===\nIn this sequel to ''The Absent-Minded Professor'', <span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">Hawk still seeks to tear down the school, especially after Brainard's government deal with Flubber falls through and it remains a government secret. When Brainard's experiments with Flubbergas accidentally break glass all over town, Auld Lang Syne Insurance finds itself in a deep debt from having to pay for repairs. Hawk eventually tracks the incident to Brainard and seeks to seize the Flubbergas as a means of perpetuating a glass installation and insurance scam across the country, though when Brainard denies him, Hawk takes Brainard to court for being responsible for the property damage across town. The case is dismissed when it is discovered that the original Flubbergas testing had the side-effect of functioning as a super-fertilizing \"dry rain\" that could grow giant vegetables that could more than pay off the damages.</span>\n\n===''[[Herbie Rides Again]]''===\nHe's also the main antagonist in this film where he goes as a ruthless billionaire who makes a living destroying old buildings (some contains great history) to plan on building skyscrapers and shopping malls. He was going to destroy the [[The Firehouse (The Love Bug)|Steinmetz Firehouse]], home of [[Mrs. Steinmetz]], the aunt of [[Tennessee Steinmetz]], the mechanic of [[Herbie]] in ''[[The Love Bug]]'', but got foiled by Herbie and many of his friends, including other Volkswagens. In this incarnation, he's renamed Alonzo A. Hawk, probably by mistake.\u00a0\n\n==List of Hawk-inspired characters in other productions==\n===John Slade===\nIn the [[1976]]\u00a0''[[The Shaggy D.A.]]'', the sequel to [[1959]]'s ''[[The Shaggy Dog]]'', Keenan Wynn portrays another ruthless billionaire character, named\u00a0[[John Slade]], which is a lookalike of Hawk in both behavior and look. It remains unknown why Disney didn't simply reuse the name of Alonzo Hawk, as the name is the only difference between Slade and Hawk.\n\n==Other Hawk-inspired characters in Disney movies==\nWikipedia also lists two other characters who aren't exactly Alonzo Hawk but seem to have been somehow inspired by him; the first being\u00a0Martin Ridgeway from [[1972]]'s\u00a0''[[Snowball Express]]'', another bad banker played by Keenan Wynn, but less dishonest than Hawk; and the second (and the only animated one) being\u00a0[[J. J. Wagstaff]]\u00a0from\u00a0''[[Fluppy Dogs]]''.\n\nIn ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'''s [[1997]] remake ''[[Flubber]]'', Hawk's antagonistic role in the story would be taken by Chester Hoenicker. However, that character would actually be the secondary adversary, as the remake's true main bad guy would be [[Wilson Croft]] (the remake's version of Professor Shelby Ashton).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"180\" spacing=\"medium\">\nAlonzoHawk.jpg\nHerbiera5.jpg|Alonzo Hawk about to destroy the Steinmetz Firehouse\n18800-17821.jpg|Alonzo Hawk in ''Son of Flubber''\n5560 5 screenshot.png|Alonzo Hawk trying to kidnap Herbie\nWatch The AbsentMinded Professor (1961) Online for Free - Viooz.jpg|Alonzo Hawk's defeat in ''The Absent-Minded Professor''\nSon of Flubber Court Scene.mov - YouTube.jpg|Alonzo Hawk's defeat in ''Son of Flubber''\nHerbie saves the day - YouTube.jpg|Alonzo Hawk's defeat in ''Herbie Rides Again''\nJim-schaeffing-portrait-of-keenan-wynn-as-alonzo-p.-hawk-(from-son-of-flubber).jpg|Portrait prop from ''Son of Flubber''\n</gallery>\n{{Herbie}}\n{{The Absent-Minded Professor}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hawk, Alonzo}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]\n[[Category:The Absent-Minded Professor characters]]\n[[Category:Medfield characters]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
