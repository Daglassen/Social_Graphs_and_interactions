Calip is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Calip is a researcher who lives in a cabin at Fort Hateno. He spends his time researching Ancient Shrines while boasting about his accomplishments in the field of research. He demands that people address him by his professional title, Doctor Calip, claiming that he spent too much effort to simply be called by a standard honorific. He highly values his work to the degree that he refused to tell his family where he conducts his archaeological research.
If Link indulges in his desire to be honored with the title "Doctor," he will change his attitude towards Link and share some of his findings, directly quoting from the worn book on his table, An Ancient Text. This initiates the Shrine Quest "The Cursed Statue" as he dismisses Link to continue his research.
Starting at 6:00 AM, Calip rushes to the site of his fieldwork. He stays there until 5:00 PM, at which point he begins to return home to avoid the monsters that appear at night. If rain strikes as he is out, he will rush home, explaining that his metallic glasses are a conductive hazard for lightning. If a rain shower hits before he leaves for fieldwork, he cancels his trip until the rain passes.
If Link speaks to him while he is out of his cabin, he will allow Link to observe him work provided that he stays out of his way. After completing "The Cursed Statue", Calip will become determined to solve the mystery of Kam Urog Shrine and continues to take trips out to his research site. There, he will comment on the timing of the Shrine's appearance.
