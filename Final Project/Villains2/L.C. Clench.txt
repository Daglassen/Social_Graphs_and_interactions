Clench''' is a character, who appeared in the Tomorrowland attraction [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]] and has been referenced since.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nL.C. Clench is an alien being, who is the chairman of the sinister [[X-S Tech]] conglomerate which has a corporate influence throughout the galaxy.  The X-S corporation is however known for its shady business dealings and greed.\n\nWhen an X-S research-probe discovered planet Earth, Clench began making connections with Earth's government to try and establish a corporate influence on the planet.  When holding a demonstration of ''X-S Series 1000'' teleportation devices in the [[Tomorrowland|''Tomorrowland'']]'' Convention Centre'', L.C. Clench intervened with the tech demonstration.\n\nOriginally it was planned by the scientists of X-S to transport one of the humans of Tomorrowland to their alien planet, but Clench insisted that they teleport him to Earth instead.  This change of plans caused an accident where Clench's molecular route was warped through an alien planet causing a [[The Alien|giant carnivorous monster]] to be transported to Earth in his place.\n\nThe fate of Chairman Clench remains unknown.  It is possible that he was teleported to the alien planet where the monster was picked up, alive and intact.  It is also possible that his body never truly materialized, being suspended in molecular animation similarly to [[Skippy]] in the ride's pre-show.  Another more nuanced possibility is that the alien monster found in the attraction might actually be a hybrid of Clench's own molecules and that of the alien which was picked up (similarly to teleportation accidents in sci-fi horror films like The Fly (1958/1986)).\n\n=== Development ===\nX-S tech was originally conceived as the Weyland-Yutani Corporation from Ridley Scott's Alien horror movie franchise.  This would likely place Clench's inspiration with characters like Paul Reiser's portrayal of executive Carter J. Burke from Aliens (1986).   Burke being an executive of Weyland-Yutani who manipulated subordinate freighters into obtaining the dangerous alien Xenomorph and attempted to reclaim assets from the space colony of Hadley's Hope which became infested with the aliens, before being killed by them.\n\nIn the original scripts for ExtraTERRORestrial before the ride was toned down for younger audiences, it was planned for Clench to have lured the humans into the convention centre as a means of teleporting the alien monster in the chamber with them.  He would have done this to study the potential the alien held as a living weapon for X-S on the distant planet of Earth, similarly to Weyland-Yutani's plans for the xenomorph.  Technically it is still possible that this was Clench's plan in the final attraction but there is no real implication of this within the attraction itself and relies on Clench (and possibly his subordinates) having been putting on performances.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter ===\nL.C. Clench appears on screens throughout this attraction.  He first appears in the pre-show of the attraction, introducing the humans to X-S's background and technology.  Later in the theatre area, he appears on screens from the alien planet which holds X-S headquarters, interfering with the teleportation process.\n\n=== Invasion! An ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter ([[DisneyQuest]]) ===\nJeffrey Jones reprised his role as Chairman Clench in the pre-show of this video-game attraction in DisneyQuest arcades.  In the pre-show of the attraction, he appears in Earth's white-house at a press meeting about an off-world human colony of Space Outpost 64 being attacked by aliens.\n\nClench took the attacks as an opportunity to sell the U.S. government the ''X-S 5000'', a specialized terrain vehicle which is used by players in the game to fight aliens on the planet and rescue civilians from the space-colony.\n\n=== [[Skipper Canteen|Jungle Navigation Co. Ltd Skipper Canteen]] ===\nAn easter egg reference to Clench and Alien Encounter can be found in the library area of this [[Adventureland]] restaurant.  There is a book in the library called ''Creatures from Space!''\u00a0which is written by an author named Clench.\n\n=== [[Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!]] ===\nIn the [[Taneleer Tivan|Collecto]]r's office in this attraction, there is an invoice sent to the Collector's [[The Collector's Fortress|Tivan Collection]] from X-S Tech.  Said invoice is signed by chairman Clench himself.  If Mission: BREAKOUT! is intended to be set after Alien Encounter, this could be an indication that Clench survived his teleportation accident and found his way back to X-S.\n\n\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]]\n[[Category:Avengers Campus characters]]"
