With her brilliance also comes arrogance as she has trouble letting go of petty things that irk her. Because she is determined to stay on top, she can understandably get paranoid and lash out at others. This is usually her own undoing as she has trouble working with others. She has a daughter, which shows that she does have some semblance of a personal life, though compared to her, she is very unhinged.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Marvel's Spider-Man''===\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n===''M.O.D.O.K.''===\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMonica has genius level biochemistry and technical knowledge.
