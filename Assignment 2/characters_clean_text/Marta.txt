Marta is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Marta is a Gerudo soldier who can be found in the barracks in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to her, she talks about how Babi's training is tough, but feels that she should not complain because of their failure to stop the Yiga Clan from stealing Riju's Thunder Helm. If Link speaks to Marta after recovering the Thunder Helm, she is relieved that they can finally take a break. However, she expresses concern that Babi has special training ready for them after they repair their spears. Marta also feels that Babi is working too hard and hopes that she never becomes as intense as her.
