He engineers the overthrow of the Duke and seizes power in [[Drekmore Castle|Drekmore]].\n\nHe hates [[Gummi Bears]] and wants to get rid of their [[Gummiberry Juice|Gummiberry bushes]]. In fact, his first command is to order the Ogres to destroy them. Against this threat, the Gummi Bears help Igthorn regain his Dukedom, if only because he himself values the crop for his own purposes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=150 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nToadwart12.JPG\nDuke Igthorn15.JPG\nGummiBears-ProductionArt-JustATadSmarter-Tadpole.png|Production art\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
