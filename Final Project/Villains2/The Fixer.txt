Upon his head is a sort of hat of unknown make and purpose.\n\n{{Buzz Lightyear of Star Command}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fixer, The}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Buzz Lightyear of Star Command characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]"
