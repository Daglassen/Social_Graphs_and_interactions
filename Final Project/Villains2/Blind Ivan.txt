''He was head a [[Blind Eye Society|group of people]] who keep the secrets of town a mystery and erase others' memories of the events by using an invention, created by [[Old Man McGucket]] that makes them forget.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn \"[[Society of the Blind Eye]]\", Ivan oversees the erasing of\u00a0[[Lazy Susan]]'s\u00a0memories after she discovers [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]]' population of\u00a0gnomes. When\u00a0[[Dipper Pines|Dipper]],\u00a0[[Mabel Pines|Mabel]],\u00a0[[Soos Ramirez|Soos]],\u00a0[[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]], and [[Old Man McGucket]] learn of the society's intentions, he later takes part in a manhunt to capture and warp the group's memories of their summer, however, he is defeated by McGucket, who has grown immune to the\u00a0device's\u00a0effects due to his fractured psyche. Ultimately, Dipper resolves to ironically erase Ivan and the other society member's memories of the existence of the Blind Eye Society, with Ivan's deep ties in the organization causing him to suffer long-term memory loss. Having lost complete knowledge of his identity, Mabel convinces him he is a traveling banjo minstrel named \"Toot-Toot McBumbersnazzle\", a role that Ivan happily adapts to by singing his name with joy and pride.\n\nIvan is briefly seen at the\u00a0Woodstick\u00a0festival in \"[[The Love God]]\", wandering around with a puzzled but content smile, implying he is still suffering from his memory loss.\n\nIn \"[[Weirdmageddon Part 1]]\", the gearshift in the car that\u00a0Bill Cipher\u00a0summons strangely resembles Ivan's head. However, it is unknown if this was the real Blind Ivan turned into an auto part.\n\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ivan, Blind}}\n[[es:Ivan Cegado]]\n[[nl:Blinde Ivan]]\n[[pl:Ivan \u015alepy]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
