''She is a pixie who sends the young [[Artemis Fowl II|Artemis Fowl]] a message of warning. She then kidnaps Artemis Fowl's [[Artemis Fowl II|father]], warning him that he will never see him again after taking something of great value from her. Koboi also orders Artemis to \"return it to me or I will destroy everything you love.\"\n==Personality==\nGenocidal and ruthless, Koboi resented everything about the human people by blaming them for the previous war. She also was appalled how her race had been reduced among humans to silly stories and the objects of laughter which frightened children. Koboi coveted the Aculos, convinced that the magical object would grant her ultimate power. She wished to annihilate mankind by staying in the shadows, never showing her face and speaking with a raspy voice.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Artemis Fowl}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Artemis Fowl characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Elves]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]"
