He is the younger brother of [[Greyson]],<ref name=\"Brother\"/> who works at the Mine while Pelison plays with [[Axyl]]. At night, he is soundly asleep beneath a tarp. Pelison comments that his brother is always complaining,<ref name=\"Brother\"/> but indicates that he never tells him why.<ref>{{Cite|Have you ever wondered why grown-ups are always so secretive...?|Pelison|BotW}}</ref> He asks Link if he knows, and in frustration insists that he should tell him the truth.<ref>{{Cite|But why? Why don't you know? If you're a grown-up, you should always say the truth!|Pelison|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link tells Greyson about a job opportunity removing boulders in [[Tarrey Town]] as part of the \"[[From the Ground Up]]\" [[Side Quest]], he accepts and takes Pelison with him.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks for lettin' me know, brother! Pelison and I are gonna head there right away! While I'm at it... Pelison! We're gonna leave!|Greyson|BotW}}</ref> Since Pelison's name also ends in \"son,\" a mandatory criteria of the [[Bolson]] Construction company's name policy,<ref>{{Cite|Oh, and one last wrinkle... Yeah, in accordance with the official {{Color|BotW Blue|Bolson Construction}} policy, that someone's name must end in \"son.\" If you run into anyone that fits with what I've said, send them here to {{Color|BotW Blue|Tarrey Town}} for me.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> [[Hudson]] is happy to accept him in as well.<ref>{{Cite|Those boulders don't stand a chance against them... And with names like Greyson and Pelison, they'll fit right in.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> Pelison opens [[Ore and More]] in Tarrey Town, where he sells the [[Gem]]s that his brother finds while removing the Town's boulders.<ref>{{Cite|Once we started breakin' up the rock here, we found that it's rich in {{Color|BotW Blue|ore}}. So I've decided to open up shop! I'm not sure why we have so much ore here, but maybe it's because we're close to {{Color|BotW Blue|Death Mountain}}. Anyway, these here are freshly mined. Be sure to buy a whole bunch!|Pelison|BotW}}</ref> Pelison comments that because Greyson is happy, he is happy to be in Tarrey Town too.<ref>{{Cite|My brother should be breakin' rocks around there. Either that or he's zonin' out, heh. He's so much happier than when he was workin' at the {{Color|BotW Blue|Southern Mine}}. When he's happy, I'm happy!|Pelison|BotW}}</ref> However, he also comments that it is cold there.<ref>{{Cite|It's so cold here. Or maybe it's just that Goron City is too hot!|Pelison|BotW}}</ref>\n\nPelison is also one of the guests present at Hudson's and [[Rhondson]]'s wedding. He agrees with the vow that Rhondson should name her children in accordance to the Bolson Construction naming policy.<ref>{{Cite|And a vow of guidelines compliance!|Pelison|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Gorons\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
