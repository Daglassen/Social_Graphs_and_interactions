Cursed Bokoblins are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series. They are an undead variant of Bokoblin though their appearances differ between games.

=== Skyward Sword ===
Fi's Comment:
Undead whose hatred accords them the ability to reanimate, Cursed Bokoblins take on a decaying appearance — with skeletal and bandaged arms, glowing yellow eyes, and chipped horns — and this is further exemplified by the flies swarming around them. They are primarily encountered in the deepest depths of the Ancient Cistern, though they also appear in the Sky Keep. If Link is nearby, Cursed Bokoblins will emerge from the ground in large groups and pursue him, attacking by latching onto Link and biting him. In addition to dealing damage, their bite also places a Curse on Link.
Link can exploit the monsters' fear of shiny objects by holding up either his Sword while it is charged with the Skyward Strike or the Sacred Shield (or one of its upgrades) to keep them at bay. Curse Bokoblins can withstand many blows before succumbing, and they often get back up. Using Bombs will instantly defeat them, at which point they may drop an Evil Crystal.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Cursed Bokoblins appear in Breath of the Wild as floating heads, similar to Bubbles, and are spawned from Malice. They are only found within the four Divine Beasts and Hyrule Castle, charging at Link if he is within range. The only way to stop Cursed Bokoblins from spawning is to destroy the eye that is creating them.
