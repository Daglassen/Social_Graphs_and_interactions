filled for many the things Voltaire would done remained the film early drafts for the film the weasels would have been unnamed and all have similar personalities and there would have been least ten them All the weasels would die laughing compared Smartass being killed the Dip Additionally instead Judge Doom killing Maroon himself the weasels would have done while disguised Roger Rabbit Despite the weasels each having official names shown the end credits none them are addressed another any the other characters the film name the latter simply referring them the weasels Roger the only character call them the Toon Patrol though only once when hand cuffed Eddie Also any the weasels heard speaking off screen closed captioning also does not use the name the weasel question instead simply calling him Weasel Greasy makes cameo the Bonkers series the episode Mice and Menace appears couple mugshots computer implying that the weasels are criminals the series Smartass name censored
