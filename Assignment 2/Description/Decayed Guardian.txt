They are found buried in the ground, unable to move due to having no legs. Decayed Guardians appear inactive until {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} approaches it, when they light up and aim their laser sights at Link in preparation to fire.<ref>{{Cite|Approach with caution; some of these derelict models have been known to awaken from stasis and attack when approached.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> A massive amount of Decayed Guardians can be found in the [[Forgotten Temple]] and will simultaneously take aim at Link the moment he enters the temple. They are prone to malfunctioning after being attacked, firing off several lasers in rapid succession.\n\nIf Link performs a {{Term|BotW|Perfect Guard|link}} with any {{Term|BotW||Shield|link}} on its laser, it is instantly defeated. If {{Term|BotW|Link}} hits a Decayed Guardian in its eye using a bow, it will temporarily stun it. Using {{Term|BotW|Stasis|link|display=Stasis +}} on a charging up Decayed Guardian will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during stasis.\n\nIn {{Term|BotW|Master Mode|link}}, Decayed Guardians will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge up phase before firing their laser to throw off Link's timing.\n\n===Locations===\n* {{Term|BotW|Akkala Tower|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Ash Swamp|link}}\n* Between {{Term|BotW|Tobio's Hollow|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Dracozu River|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Central Tower|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Daval Peak|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|East Gerudo Mesa|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Eastern Abbey|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Forgotten Temple|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Fort Hateno|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle Town Ruins|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Lomei Labyrinth Island|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Military Training Camp|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Mount Drena|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|North Akkala Foothill|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Quarry Ruins|link}}\n* South of {{Term|BotW|South Lomei Labyrinth|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Torin Wetland|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Trial of the Sword|link}} {{DLC|TMT}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Vatorsa Snowfield|link}}\n\n===Drops===\nA Decayed Guardian drops between 4 and 6 of:\n{{BotWDropTable | Ancient Screw | 40 | Ancient Spring | 25 | Ancient Gear | 20 | Ancient Shaft | 15 }}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Eastern Abbey Guardian.png|A Decayed Guardian attacking Link\nFile:BotW Perfect Guard Projectile.png|Link performing a Perfect Guard on a Decayed Guardian's laser\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Guardian (Breath of the Wild)|Guardian]]\n* [[Guardian Stalker]]\n* [[Guardian Scout]]\n* [[Guardian Turret]]\n* [[Guardian Skywatcher]]\n* [[Sentry]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Ancient Technology, Guardians\n |enemies= BotW\n}}"
