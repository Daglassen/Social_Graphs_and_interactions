The thing is...just the other day, one of our customers said he saw a {{Color|BotW Red|white horse}} on {{Color|BotW Blue|Safula Hill}} recently... Could it be a relative of the royal family's {{Color|BotW Red|white horse}} from my grandfather's day? Well, if you happen to see a {{Color|BotW Red|white horse}} on your travels, do you think you could bring it back to me?|Toffa|BotW}}</ref> As Toffa's grandfather told him that the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]] once had a pure-white [[Horse]] that grazed on Safula Hill, he suspects that this White Horse may be a descendant of the Royal Family's Horse.<ref name=\"Grazing\"/> He then asks Link to catch the White Horse and, after domesticating it and registering it at a Stable, to show it to him.<ref name=\"Grazing\"/> If Link agrees, Toffa will thank him and task him with the [[Side Quest]] \"[[The Royal White Stallion]]\".<ref>{{Cite|[Leave it to me!] Thank you!
