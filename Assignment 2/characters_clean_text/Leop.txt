Leop is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Leop is an older Hylian living in Hateno Village. He diligently stands outside The Great Ton Pu Inn, welcoming visitors and imploring them to stay. According to him, the Inn is the best place in the village to rest. He suggests travelers speak with Prima, the Inn's proprietor, if they wish to stay.
Leop can be found at the base of the Inn's stairs at most hours of the day and night, but will retreat to the Inn's kitchen when it rains.
Leop has heard of the child in the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab, and believes the rumour that Purah's Granddaughter is visiting her.[citation needed]
