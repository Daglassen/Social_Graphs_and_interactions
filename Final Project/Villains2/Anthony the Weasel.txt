Weasel works for [[The Baron]]\u00a0as his\u00a0right-hand man, until he took his Kai spider ring and his minions.\n\n==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==\n===Season one===\nAnthony first appeared in \"[[The Return of Strongbow]]\" where, eight years in the past, Weasel betrays Flynn and Lance during a royal caravan robbery. As he makes off with the goods, Weasel notes that his actions were \"Baron's orders\".\n\nWeasel returned in \"[[Big Brothers of Corona]]\"; he was sent by the Baron to capture Angry and Red for crossing him. When Eugene offers him a deal\u2014in which Anthony frees Angry and Red in exchange for Eugene and Lance\u2014he lets them go and send his henchmen to get Eugene and Lance. Angry and Red are able to fend off the goons and free Eugene and Lance, leaving Weasel empty-handed.\n\n===Season two===\nIn \"[[Beyond the Corona Walls]]\", Weasel informs the Baron that Flynn Rider has returned to [[Vardaros]], where the kingpin has established as his base of operation. Weasel and the other goons kidnap Rider and Strongbow in a coup to have the former marry the Baron's daughter, [[Stalyan]]. They fail due to the interference of [[Rapunzel]]. During the final battle, [[Adira]] appears and frees Eugene, who punches Anthony and kicks one goon and reclaims his sword and Eugene fights Baron. Afterwards, the Baron is bitten by his own venomous spider, forcing him and Stalyan to leave the city in search of the cure.\n\nIn \"[[The Return of Quaid]]\", the Weasel takes over Vardaros in the Baron's place, but his position of power is challenged by Rapunzel. The Weasel, unable to defeat the princess on his own, hires a bounty hunter to do away with her instead. Unfortunately for the Weasel, Rapunzel enlists the help of the retired [[Captain Quaid]], who manages to defeat the Collector with help from his deputy, [[Vex]]. This forces the Weasel to leave, freeing Vardaros.\n\nIn \"[[Max and Eugene in Peril on the High Seas]]\", he was on a prison ship along with almost all of Rapunzel's old enemies, including Lady Caine, her crew, the Stabbington brothers, and Axel. They took control of the ship and planned to take off at the mainland, only to be thwarted by Eugene, Max, Rapunzel, and the rest of the gang.\n\n===Season 3===\nAt the end of \"[[Plus Est En Vous]]\" following the defeat of [[Zhan Tiri]], Anthony is seen with a lady hugging him (presumably his date).\n==Trivia==\nHis alias \"Weasel\" is from its\u00a0figurative expression which means\u00a0a deceitful or treacherous person,\u00a0achieve something by use of cunning or deceit.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBig Brothers of Corona 32.jpg\nBig Brothers of Corona (1).jpg\nBig Brothers of Corona (14).jpg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 5.png\nBeyond the Corona Walls 9.png\nBeyond the Corona Walls 59.jpeg\nThe Return of Quaid 11.jpg\nThe Return of Quaid 35.png\nThe Return of Quaid 24.jpg\nThe Return of Quaid 36.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses|Bosses]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
