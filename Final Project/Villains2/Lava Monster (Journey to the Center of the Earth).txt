It used one particular cavern to lay its egg-sacs.  This island was notably occupied by one [[Captain Nemo]] who used, \"Terravators\" of his own design to explain the life-filled subterranean ecosystems of Vulcania. The lava creature would be highly territorial with Nemo and his forces however.\n\n=== Development History ===\nThe lava monster is inspired by a giant lava worm that was part of an earlier plan to add a \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" stop to the [[Studio Backlot Tour]] in association with a failed movie adaptation in the early 1990s. A popular urban legend connects the character to the alien from [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]], suggesting they recycled the same molds, but the two figures differ significantly in size and bulk.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Journey to the Center of the Earth ===\nThe lava monster appears in the climax for this attraction, roaring at guests in their Terravators as they pass through the creature's nest due to an earthquake. They are able to narrowly escape the monster and return to the surface.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nJourney to the Center of the Earth Lava Monster.jpg\nlava-monster-journey-center-earth.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Lava Monster}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
