"[[File:Doctor_Vulter.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Doctor Vulter''' is a villain featured in [[Mickey Mouse]] comics. He was created by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Floyd Gottfredson]] in the story ''Mickey Mouse and the Pirate Submarine'', published in the ''Mickey Mouse'' daily strip from September [[1935]] to January [[1936]]. \n\nDr. Vulter is an anthropomorphic [[ape]], resembling a gorilla. He is a megalomaniacal pirate captain and mad scientist, somewhat modeled after [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Captain Nemo]] character. Using a futuristic submarine and a small army of henchmen, he plagues the seas by stealing various ships which he aims to use for his plans of world conquest. His principal weapon is a machine in the form of a large claw which gives off magnetic-like energy: by placing it against a ship's hull Vulter can turn the whole metal ship into one large magnet which sticks weapons to the wall, making them useless. Vulter's Germanic-sounding name, his uniform and monocle, as well as his plans of world domination and militaristic gang, are obvious echoes of the Nazi menace of the time. After being defeated by Mickey, Vulter never appeared again in [[United States|American]] stories. He was, however, used by [[Italy|Italian]] authors, starting with the 1959 story ''Topolino e il ritorno dell'artiglio magnetico'' (\"Mickey Mouse and the Return of the Magnetic Claw\") by Guido Martina (plot) and Giulio Chierchini (art). The character was further elaborated in this story by the claim that he never drew plans of his inventions but kept it all in his mind; this proved a bit of a problem when he suffered from amnesia. He returned occasionally and is still used from time to time by European authors.\n\n{{Wikipedia|Mickey Mouse universe}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
