Buliara sent you? My apologies! I'm the officer in charge of the soldiers, Captain {{Color|BotW Blue|Teake}}.|Teake|BotW}}</ref> If [[Link]] speaks to her, she questions what he is doing in the barracks and tells him to leave because they are on high alert due to a recent theft.<ref>{{Cite|What are you doing in here?! This is the barracks for the {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}}'s guards, not a place for tourists to gather.|Teake|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|We're on high alert after the recent theft, so you should clear out.|Teake|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to her again, she warns him not to make the guards any more tense than they already are.<ref>{{Cite|You again?! The guards are already tense, thanks to those thieves. Please don't make it worse for them!|Teake|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Teake after speaking to [[Riju]] for the first time, she initially tells him again to leave,<ref>{{Cite|You again?! How many times do I have to tell you before you get it?! Get. Out. Of. Here!|Teake|BotW}}</ref> but apologizes after Link explains that [[Buliara]] sent him.<ref name=\"Captain\"/> She continues to explain that the [[Thunder Helm]] was stolen by the [[Yiga Clan]] the other day and that the [[Yiga Clan Hideout]] is in [[Karusa Valley]].<ref>{{Cite|The chief's heirloom was stolen by thieves belonging to the Yiga Clan the other day, so everyone is on edge...|Teake|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|We've determined that the Yiga's hideout is in {{Color|BotW Red|Karusa Valley}}, but...|Teake|BotW}}</ref> Teake says that she was just thinking about requesting extra help and then proceeds to inform the soldiers to tell Link any information.<ref>{{Cite|The soldiers are all exhausted, so I was just thinking about requesting some extra help...|Teake|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Hey, everyone! Listen up!}} This Hylian vai has agreed to help us, so offer her any information you can!|Teake|BotW}}</ref> Teake then tells Link to consider himself part of their unit.<ref>{{Cite|Consider yourself a part of our unit! If you have any questions, my troops will be happy to help.|Teake|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Teake after recovering the Thunder Helm, she compliments Link's combat abilities and asks if he will join the Gerudo forces.<ref>{{Cite|To think that the Gerudo would be able to learn something of combat from a Hylian...|Teake|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Will you consider joining our forces?|Teake|BotW}}</ref> If Link accepts her offer, she laughs, but says that she knows he is on an important quest.<ref>{{Cite|Ha ha ha! That's reassuring to hear! However, I already spoke with the {{Color|BotW Blue|chief}} about you...
