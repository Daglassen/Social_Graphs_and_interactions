"[[File:Mirrors.png|thumb]]\n'''Mirrors''' is a recurring villain from Jetix's ''[[Yin Yang Yo!]]'' He is voiced by Jonathan Wilson.\n\n==Personality==\nMirrors is [[Smoke]]'s rivaled brother. He thinks, that because he is male, he is better than his sister. Also he confessed that he smells \"like a backside of a donkey\". His hair style looks similar to Goku, and he has zig-zags under each eye, similar to Ash Ketchum's. It's unknown how old he is, but it's revealed in the episode \"[[Worked Stiff]]\" that he is old enough to drive; in addition, it's revealed that he is a narcissist and keeps a monkey in the trunk of his car. He does show Smoke love however, just not as much as she wants, or hardly as much as she shows him.\n\n==Abilities==\nMirrors has similar powers like his sister, being super strong and fast. He can also teleport like [[Smoke]], but in a flash of yellow light. He can also float and fly. While he doesn't have a weapon, he does use exploding roses. Mirrors carries yellow Prison Prisms, a parody of Pok\u00e9balls. They are used to capture creatures called \"Forever Friends\". Unlike Pok\u00e9balls, one Prison Prism can hold more than one creature. If the Forever Friend doesn't want to fight, he can force it through a special ring. When a Forever Friend losses a fight, it becomes the winner's property. His shown friends are:\n*'''Hunkapu''' - a creature resembling Pikachu that grows larger and can fire spikes while spinning.\n*'''Pupitator''' - a puppygriff that he won with Hunkapu.\n*'''Halapeno Jack''' - a cheese creature that fires cheese; however, he was defeated by [[Yang]].\n*'''Laundry Monster''' - a monster made from that laundry which was once worn by the rabbits until they decided to wash it.\n*'''[[Yin (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yin]]''' - Mirror's forever friend in \"[[Smoke and Mirrors (Yin Yang Yo!)]]\". However, Yin managed to imprison Smoke and Mirrors (Yin Yang Yo!) (Yin Yang Yo!) inside the Prison Prism at the end.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Prison Prisms might be a parody of the Pok\u00e9balls, since Smoke and Mirrors (Yin Yang Yo!) seem to be Japanese anime-like characters.\n\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
