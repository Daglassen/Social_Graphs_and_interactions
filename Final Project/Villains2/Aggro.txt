He usually aids Nemex in his plans of stealing all of the Tomorrowland Transit Authority's technology and conquering the universe, but most of his ideas end up thwarted by [[Miles Callisto]] and [[Mission Force One|company]]. He is usually the one Nemex blames for Nemesystems' failures, even if it wasn't his fault at all! Though he sees himself as a hero, he is mainly a bumbling fool, though he is even smarter than his commander at times.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Minions]]"
