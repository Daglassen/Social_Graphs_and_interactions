His desire to learn about the various weapons in the world leads him to give {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} the {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}}, \"{{Term|BotW|The Weapon Connoisseur|link}}.\" He can often be found circling the signpost in front of the {{Term|BotW|Ventest Clothing Boutique|link}}, wondering about the wold outside of his village.<ref>{{Cite|The big wide world...|Nebb|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce Link stops him to chat, Nebb asks him if he is from beyond Hateno.<ref>{{Cite|Hey! Hey, mister. Did you come from the big wide world?|Nebb|BotW}}</ref> The boy points out that the hero appears to be capable of defending himself and asks Link if this is true.<ref>{{Cite|You look like you\u2019re good with a bow and sword, so you must be pretty strong. Are you strong or what?|Nebb|BotW}}</ref> Regardless of his answer, Nebb decides to ask Link for help in making a dream of his come true.<ref>{{Cite|I bet you can use all sorts of different weapons, right? Sooo\u2026 Do you wanna help a kid\u2019s dream come true?|Nebb|BotW}}</ref> Nebb explains that his grandfather was a lover of weaponry who passed away before seeing all of the weapons he wanted to.<ref>{{Cite|My gramps is dead now, but when he was alive, he loved weapons. Though he never got to see all the ones he wanted.|Nebb|BotW}}</ref> Nebb asks Link to bring different weapons back to Hateno so that one day, he can reunite with his grandfather and describe them to him.<ref>{{Cite|So you bring me weapons and show \u2018em to me, and then I can tell gramps about \u2018em when I meet him again!|Nebb|BotW}}</ref> Link is happy to agree to the task and Nebb's first request is for a {{Term|BotW|Traveler's Sword|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|[OK!] Yeahhh! I knew you\u2019d do it! Hmm, where should we start? Have you heard of the {{Color|BotW Blue|traveler\u2019s sword}}? I\u2019ve seen it in books, but never in real life before! If you find it, please let me see it!|Nebb|BotW}}</ref> The end of the conversation begins the quest.\n\nIf Link returns to him without the proper item equipped, Nebb will remind him of which weapon he wants to see.<ref>{{Cite|Hey! If you find a {{Color|BotW Blue|traveler\u2019s sword}}, please let me see it! That would be so cool!|Nebb|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen it rains, Nebb runs home to get out of the shower. There, he plays with a small stick, using it as a makeshift sword.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hateno Villagers, Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
