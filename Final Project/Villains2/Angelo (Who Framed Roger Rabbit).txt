However, he enjoys the antics of [[Roger Rabbit]] and when [[Judge Doom]] comes looking for him at the Terminal Bar, Angelo defends him and shows great sadness when Judge Doom is getting ready to kill him with the [[Dip]].\n\nEddie describes Angelo as the kind of guy who \"would rat on you for a nickel\". However, he also has a kind side, as shown when he comforts a bar customer that Judge Doom harassed; also he did not betray Roger to Doom despite the large sum offered.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAngelo is not an important character and plays no major role. He often spends time at the Terminal Bar. He is first seen when he overhears that Eddie was hired by [[R.K. Maroon]]. He starts to poke fun at Eddie, provoking Eddie into berating him and stuffing a hard-boiled egg in his mouth. He recovers and asks about Eddie's short-tempered behavior. [[Dolores]], the bar's waitress, and Eddie's girlfriend, tells him that his brother Teddy was killed by a [[Toon]], shocking him.\n\nLater, Angelo is enjoying a song-and-dance performance by Roger at the bar before Eddie cuts it off. Judge Doom shows up shortly after looking for Roger. He makes a tempting offer that Angelo whistles at. He then says he has seen a rabbit, about to spill the beans, but then turns to the stool behind him and jokingly says \"Well, say hello... [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(play) Harvey].\" and laughs at the way Judge Doom fell for it. Doom finds Roger anyway and prepares to dip him. Angelo takes his hat off in respect. Luckily, Eddie, remembering a trick earlier in the film, gives Roger a glass of liquor which causes him to go out of control and escape. Angelo is not seen for the remainder of the film.\n\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
