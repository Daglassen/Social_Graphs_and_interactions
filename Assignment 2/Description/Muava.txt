To [[Link]]'s surprise, Muava immediately notices that Link is a man when he speaks to her.<ref>{{Cite|What's a voe doing here...|Muava|BotW}}</ref> Muava says that he might be able to fool everyone else, but not her.<ref>{{Cite|Surprised? You might be able to fool all the other vai around here, but you won't fool me so easily.|Muava|BotW}}</ref> Muava does not care that Link has snuck into Gerudo Town and asks him to stay and chat with her.<ref>{{Cite|Don't worry, though. It doesn't matter much to me what you do.|Muava|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|But...since you came all the way back here, maybe you'd like to stay a bit and chat?|Muava|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about the nearby Goddess Statue, Muava tells him that the Statue has been there long before she was born.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, the Goddess Statue has been here since long before I was even born.|Muava|BotW}}</ref> She explains that nobody comes there anymore because they do not \"believe in that stuff anymore,\" comparing it to how people avoid her now as well.<ref>{{Cite|No one here really believes in that stuff anymore, though, so they tend to avoid stopping here. Kind of like they avoid me...|Muava|BotW}}</ref> Muava says that someone has to keep the Goddess Statue company.<ref>{{Cite|But someone has to keep the Goddess Statue company, so here I am...|Muava|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks Muava if she has ever left Gerudo Town, Muava explains that she was once a beautiful traveler when she was young and claims that men almost always noticed her enter a room.<ref>{{Cite|Oh ho, I may not look it now, but I was quite the traveler when I was young. Quite a beauty, too!|Muava|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It was a rare thing for a voe not to notice me come into a room.|Muava|BotW}}</ref> Muava recalls when she traveled across [[Hyrule]] in search of [[Lover's Pond]] to meet her true love, but never found it.<ref>{{Cite|But...I had a fairy-tale notion in my mind. I'd heard of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Lover's Pond}}, and I thought I'd meet my true love there.|Muava|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I traveled all across Hyrule, searching for this fabled place. But I couldn't find it...|Muava|BotW}}</ref> Muava then says that before she knew it, she was old and men no longer paid attention to her.<ref>{{Cite|And before I knew it, I'd grown old. The voe no longer turned when I walked in.|Muava|BotW}}</ref> She snaps at Link to stop looking so sad and assures him that it was a long time ago.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, don't look so sad! I stopped being sad about it a long time ago. And I chased my dreams!|Muava|BotW}}</ref> Muava enjoys talking to Link, commenting that it is a treat to chat with a man again.<ref>{{Cite|Heheheh... It's such a treat to chat with a voe again. Will you humor me a little bit longer?|Muava|BotW}}</ref> Before Link ends the conversation, Muava advises him to live his life to the fullest.<ref>{{Cite|Just live your life to the fullest, little voe!|Muava|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
