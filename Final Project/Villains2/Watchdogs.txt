They are his loyal minions that do his selfish, dirty deeds.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nWatchdogs act like typical ordinary soldiers/henchmen of evil overlords, doing what they are told and ordered to and otherwise being disinterested in their master's greater conflicts. They are usually rather incompetent, from making pathetic mistakes in both everyday tasks and battle (e.g. showing poor aim with a blaster) to generally being clumsy; for instance, in \"[[The Eye on the Skullship]]\", several Watchdogs are hilariously defeated by a training dummy shaped like Sylvia due to it simply swinging around.\n\nHowever, they can be dangerously vigilant and smarter than they appear. In one example, during \"[[The Fugitives]]\" they realized Wander's desire to help people could be exploited by abusing villagers so they cry for help, and when poor Wander gave in and aided everyone in need the Watchdogs cornered and captured him. Moreover, they have exhibited impressive tactical abilities when suitably motivated, such as their skilled rescue of Lord Hater from Wander and Sylvia in \"[[The Gift 2: The Giftening]]\" and \"The Gift\" as they believed Hater was sending them gifts (in reality it was Wander, unsurprisingly) and as such they finally felt appreciated by their master. In general, they show greater genuine competency when being lead by Peepers as opposed to the unpredictable Hater.\n\nIn combat, they mainly wield blasters and several different units utilize equipment such as jetpacks and scuba gear. In \"[[The Axe]]\", the Watchdogs battle [[Sourdough the Evil Sandwich]]'s fleet in space using 'Eye Fighters', parodies of the [[TIE Fighter]]s from ''[[Star Wars]]'' that have giant eyes for cockpits.\n\nOutside of battle, many Watchdogs have been seen pursuing general interests and several are employed in less combative roles, such as Giuseppe the tailor. Some Watchdogs seek romance and several of them are good friends with each other. They also appear to enjoy being on TV, becoming extremely excited when Watchdog Andy films his show during \"The Eye on the Skullship\" as his interviews with them made them feel special - to the point they began rioting when his show was stopped by Peepers and Hater until it was restarted.\n\nWhile they are generally loyal to Lord Hater first and foremost, they occasionally defer to Peepers whenever their master is being less than effective a leader, such as in \"[[The New Toy]]\" where they readily join the Commander in enacting his risky but well-crafted plan to hit [[Lord Dominator]] with a powerful freezing weapon, while Hater merely wants to impress her and win her heart - and thus endanger his entire forces - with a ridiculous and childish vehicle he designed. On the other hand, their loyalty to Lord Hater occasionally manifests in them being as idiotic as he can be; for example, in \"[[The Brainstorm]]\", when Hater visualizes one of Peeper's failed plans hypothetically resulting in them growing old and falling out over a beautiful woman, a couple of the assembled Watchdogs comfort their sobbing master while the rest glare at Peepers for his non-existent 'betrayal'.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Watchdogs appear to be small human-like soldiers with eyes for heads. Their uniforms consist of a black jumpsuit with red gloves and boots and a hat with a single lightning bolt on top, giving them a similar appearance to Lord Hater. Their jumpsuits and hats appear purple in poorly lit areas. Watchdogs have pink skin, and appear to grow body hair as well. While most Watchdogs have rotund bodies, the Watchdog named Moose has a noticeable muscular physique, as does Peepers under his uniform. There are male and female Watchdogs, though only the males speak in the show.\n\n===Members===\n*Commander [[Peepers]] (Leader)\n*Aaron, Andy, Alex, Amy, Ani\n*[[Westley]]\n*Barry, Bob, Ben B., Ben J., Bert, Bill, Bryan,\n*C, Craig, Carlos, Carmen, Chris H., Chris R., Chris T., Chuck, Cindy, Clay\n*Dan, Dean, Denise, Ducky, Dennis\n*Ed, Eddie, Edward, Elle, Eric B., Eric C., Erik\n*Fran, Frank\n*Greg, Giuseppe\n*Howie\n*Teddy, Tim, Tara, Teri, Trevor\n*Janice, Jamie, James, Jay, Jenny, Joe, Johanna, Jordan, Josh, Julie, Justin\n*Khaki\n*Lauren, Laurens, Leticia, Lianne, Lisa, Lynne\n*Pope Watchdog, Pap, Pete, Paul\n*Moose, Maria, Mark, Matthias, Mikey\n*Pong\n*Rae, Ray, Ric, Rob, Robbie\n*Sabrina, Seanna, Shakeh, Shawn, Steve, Susie\n*Vaughn\n*Zabrina\n\n==Trivia==\n*It has never been confirmed whether or not Watchdogs truly have mouths. However, there is some evidence that their pupils are actually mouths:\n**Instances where Watchdogs are eating shows their eyes puffing out like cheeks.\n**In \"[[The Greater Hater]]\", a shot of Peepers screaming shows what looks like a uvula in his pupil.\n**In \"The Axe\", when Peepers and Hater are swimming in a pile of bones, Peepers spits bones out of the center of his eye.\n*When the Watchdogs are rioting due to Andy's show being canceled at the end of \"The Eye on the Skullship\", they are shown chanting a variant of their battle-cry, 'ANDY FAN! BEST SHOW!', towards Lord Hater.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nWatchdog1.png\nWatchdogs.jpg\nWatchdog army.png\nPeepers in Wander Over Yonder theme song.png\nWander Over Yonder character concept art.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
