He appears in the episodes \"[[Nest Best Thing]]\" and \"[[Jailhouse Shock]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nLittle Jimmy has the typical appearance of a bluebird. He has dark blue feathers with a lighter blue chest, yellow-orange feet, and an orange beak. He also has big eyes with dark blue pupils.\n\n===Personality===\n{{Quote|'''Timon''': \"Little Jimmy wants to bump me off.\"<br>'''Pumbaa''': \"Oh, don't be silly, Timon, Little Jimmy is the most sweetest baby bird in the world.\"<br>'''Timon''':\"He's a wolf, a wolf in bird's clothing.\"|Timon and Pumbaa about Little Jimmy}}\nLittle Jimmy might seem cute and adorable, but he's dangerous. He has two voices: his sweet, innocent voice to pass himself off as a kid and his criminal mastermind voice that proves he is an adult. He likes to take advantage of people and he would hurt someone if he doesn't get what he wants. Each time he uses his criminal voice, his forehead gets wrinkled to prove his true maturity.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===\n====\"[[Nest Best Thing]]\"====\nWhen [[Timon]] climbs up a tree to catch a bug that hid under a nest, the branch breaks, causing Timon and the nest to fall. Little Jimmy lands on [[Pumbaa]]'s nose. When he introduces himself to the duo, he tells Pumbaa that he lost his home. Pumbaa is willing to help him build a new house, while Timon is reluctant as it is too much work. When Pumbaa leaves Little Jimmy alone with Timon to get some materials for the house, the bluebird, after Timon tells him that they have no time to help him, threatens the meerkat by telling him that he will murder him if he doesn't build a house as well as telling Pumbaa about his true nature.\n\n[[File:Little Jimmy with Pumbaa.png|thumb|250px|Little Jimmy tells Pumbaa that he lost his home.]]\nWhen Pumbaa returns with the tools, Timon is about to tell him what just happened but Little Jimmy interrupts. While Pumbaa reads the manual, Timon swiftly builds a birdhouse. While Pumbaa is happy about their teamwork being successful, Little Jimmy is unsatisfied with the birdhouse and asks for a few little extras.\n\nWhen Timon and Pumbaa finish rebuilding the birdhouse, Little Jimmy asks for a security system, an electric fence, and a mote. After Timon and Pumbaa build what Little Jimmy asked for, Timon tries to convince Pumbaa that Little Jimmy is dangerous, but the warthog doesn't believe him as he thinks the bluebird is too cute. But then, a group of pigeon police show up and try to arrest Little Jimmy. This makes Pumbaa realize that Timon was right.\n\n[[File:Little Jimmy with Timon.png|thumb|left|250px|Little Jimmy fighting against the pigeon police while grabbing onto Timon.]]\nPumbaa helps out by showing the police a secret entrance he and Timon built to surprise Little Jimmy. When Pumbaa gets on the roof, he uses his gas weapon to distract Little Jimmy so that the police can capture him. However, the police are also distracted by the smell, leaving it up to Pumbaa to catch the bluebird. Little Jimmy asks Pumbaa to let him go by using his fake cute nature. Pumbaa is about to at first until Timon reminds him of what just happened, making the warthog change his mind by refusing causing little Jimmy Jimmy to say that he will put a contract out on them. Therefore, Timon and Pumbaa turn Little Jimmy in.\n\nAfter Little Jimmy gets arrested, Pumbaa apologizes to Timon for not believing him. Timon accepts his friend's apology and states that from this day forward, they will never use any tool. However, when the police announce that Little Jimmy has escaped, Timon builds a hideout for himself and Pumbaa to hide from Little Jimmy.\n\n====\"[[Jailhouse Shock]]\"====\nTimon and Pumbaa are enjoying their summer while eating June Bugs. Suddenly, a policeman shows up and arrests the duo for eating June Bugs in July. When Timon asks him since when has eating June Bugs in July even been illegal, the policeman tells him that it was Little Jimmy who convinced him so, as a wad of cash is thrown to him from inside the prison cell.\n\n[[File:Little Jimmy on Smolder.png|thumb|250px|Little Jimmy convincing Smolder that Timon and Pumbaa were planning on hurting him.]]\nWhen Timon and Pumbaa find Little Jimmy, Pumbaa believes that it's a coincidence while Timon corrects his friend by telling him that the bluebird framed them. After reminding Pumbaa about the last time they saw Little Jimmy, Timon fears on what the bluebird might do to them, but Pumbaa states that since he's only a bird in a cage, he can't do anything painful to them. As Timon taunts Little Jimmy for him not being so tough, he tells them that he doesn't have to be tough since he has an enforcer now; [[Smolder the Bear]] comes out of the restroom. When Little Jimmy convinces Smolder that Timon and Pumbaa were about to hurt him, the bear states that if they do so, he is going to crush their heads. This makes Timon and Pumbaa try to figure out a way to get out of jail.\n\nWhen Timon and Pumbaa are doing aerobics, Pumbaa tells his friend that life in prison isn't so bad, until they have to work for a rock pile with Smolder and Little Jimmy. Little Jimmy gives Timon and ax and makes Smolder believe that Timon hit him with it. As the bear prepares to hurt the two, Timon and Pumbaa flee from them.\n\n[[File:Little Jimmy with Smolder the Bear.png|thumb|left|250px|Little Jimmy tells Smolder that he has been taking advantage of him.]]\nWhile Timon and Pumbaa try to find a way to get out of jail, Smolder and Little Jimmy talk about the painful things Smolder will do to the duo. Little Jimmy soon reveals that he is using Smolder as revenge on Timon and Pumbaa for turning him in. When Timon and Pumbaa attempt to make a quick escape, they run into Smolder and Little Jimmy, who prepare to hurt the two until they receive a pardon. As Smolder and Little Jimmy leave the cell, Little Jimmy reveals to Smolder that he has been taking advantage of him, causing them to start a fight.\n\nTimon and Pumbaa realize that with Smolder and Little Jimmy gone, they are fine in their cell and find prison life not so bad. However, Smolder and Little Jimmy get sent back to the cell for fighting. When they agree that it is Timon and Pumbaa's fault, the two friends escape by running into the wall, making Timon question why they haven't thought of that before.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Passeriformes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
