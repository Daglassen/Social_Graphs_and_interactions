Rima is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Rima is an elderly Gerudo who can be found in Gerudo Town. Rima is always sitting under a tarp across from The Noble Canteen. Rima was the captain of the guard of Gerudo Town before she retired and was replaced with Buliara. If Link speaks to Rima, she comments that she feels like she has met Link before even though she has no Hylian acquaintances and has never left Gerudo Town before. Rima expresses disappointment that she cannot relax after retiring. Link asks what happened and Rima explains that a gang of thieves recently stole Riju's Thunder Helm from the Gerudo Town palace. She feels that it is especially unfortunate that the stolen object was a valued heirloom. Rima says that if she was still in charge, she would strictly discipline the guards. Rima is upset that the guards did not prevent the theft of the Thunder Helm and believes this never would have happened when she was captain of the guard. She also says that Buliara should have been on the front lines of another recent incident. Link again asks what happened and Rima explains that Riju's Sand Seal, Patricia, got scared by a monster and pulled Riju toward the Divine Beast Vah Naboris. Rima says that although Naboris strikes anyone who approaches with lightning, Riju managed to escape, prompting Buliara to stay at Riju's side at all times. If Link speaks to Rima during the night, she will sit up and complain about the noisy young ones at The Noble Canteen. Rima wishes she could fix their attitudes.
