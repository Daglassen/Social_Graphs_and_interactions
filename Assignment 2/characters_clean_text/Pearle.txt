She contemplates on making Rice Balls for her sister, Rotana.
Link can find Pearle and the other three children in Gerudo Town speaking to each other as a group as the sun sets. Kalani asks them if they are in love. Makure then responds that she wants to attend Ashai's class when she grows up and get married. Pearle then comments that Ashai is unmarried and wonders what that means. Lastly, Dalia says that she heard being in love is the sweetest thing in the world, but does not think she can handle something sweeter than berries.
As Pearle is going home, she asks Link if he is planning to go out tonight. Whether Link says yes or no, she believes Link is going to The Noble Canteen and explains that the Canteen is next to her house. Pearle expresses annoyance for how loud the Canteen is during the night. While she is home, she continues to complain about the noise and says that she will always speak in a quiet voice when she grows up.
