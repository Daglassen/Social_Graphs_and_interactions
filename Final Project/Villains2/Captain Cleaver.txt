"[[File:RogerRabbitVanCitters_-51.jpeg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Captain Cleaver''' is a deleted character from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. He's a tough, gruff [[Toon]] human police captain from [[Toontown (Who Framed Roger Rabbit)|Toontown]] and the head of the T.P.D. Homicide Division.\n\nCleaver is very combative with [[Eddie Valiant]] in terms of who's going to solve the [[Marvin Acme|Acme]] case. One can only imagine what sort of twists a Toon human in an angry and confronted match over jurisdiction would have generated, and it's not only a good example of why this film works, but also why people have always wanted a sequel.\n\nIn the screen tests, he was voiced by [[Jack Angel]].\n\nHe is based on Captain Cleaver from the novel ''Who Censored Roger Rabbit?''.\n\n==Quotes==\n*(Pulling out his gun and poking Valiant) \u201cGet off the [[Roger Rabbit]] case. I got [[Jessica Rabbit|the Wife]] pegged as the killer, and I\u2019m an inch away from proving it. You keep poking around you\u2019re liable to screw up my play...and that would make me ''very'' unhappy.\u201d\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRogerRabbitVanCittersDoc-30.jpeg\nRogerRabbitVanCitters .jpeg\nRogerRabbitVanCitters -1.jpeg\nCaptain Cleaver and a Robber Sketch by Darrell Van Citters.jpg|A conceptual sketch of Captain Cleaver and a bank robber with a toon gun and a toon bullet by Darrell Van Citters.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cleaver, Captain}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
