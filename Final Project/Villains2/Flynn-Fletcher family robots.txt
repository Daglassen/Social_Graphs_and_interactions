"[[File:Backup_family_robots.png|thumb]]\nThe '''Flynn-Fletcher family robots''' are life-size robotic duplicates of the Flynn-Fletcher family acquired by [[Carl]]. They are held in readiness for situations that require one of the family members to be in the care of the [[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|O.W.C.A.]] without the other members of the family being made aware of their absence. Each of the immediate family members are represented by a robot, including one for [[Perry]]. It is not known at this time if robots have been made for the grandparents in the family.\n\nThe robotic duplicates are designed to be piloted by the animal agents. They are subject to overheating if their fluids are not at the proper level prior to field operations.
