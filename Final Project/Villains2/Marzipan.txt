She almost marries [[King Gregor]], and even had [[Princess Calla]] under a spell to the point that she almost breaks her promise and exposes her own friends, the [[Gummi Bears]], to the humans of [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]].\n\nBut Marzipan's plans are foiled by [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], who figures out that sugar is her only weakness. \n\nShe usually appears as an enchanting young woman, but this look is merely a deception; her true form is that of a hunched-over, green-skinned hag.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She is named after the confection marzipan, which primarily consists of ground almonds and sugar.\n**This is ironic on some level, as sugar is her only weakness, and causes her to revert to her true form.\n*Marzipan is one of a relatively small group of humans who find out about the existence of [[Gummi Bears]] during the course of the series. Other humans that become explicitly aware of the bears, are [[Cavin]], [[Princess Calla]], [[Duke Igthorn]], [[Lady Bane]], [[Sir Gawain]], [[Princess Marie]], [[Angelo Davini]], [[Flint Shrubwood]], [[The Hunter|the Hunter]], [[Rotocelli]], [[Doctor Dexter]], [[Lord Willoughby]], [[Prince Yen Moon]] and his subjects, Carney's assistant from the episode \"[[Never Give a Gummi an Even Break]]\", and the boy who turned himself into a Giant, from the episode \"[[When You Wish Upon a Stone]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nScreen Shot 2015-01-17 at 5.19.34 pm.png|Turning...\nScreen Shot 2015-01-17 at 5.19.45 pm.png|...her...\nScreen Shot 2015-01-17 at 5.19.50 pm.png|...true...\nScreen Shot 2015-01-17 at 5.19.54 pm.png|...self...\nScreen Shot 2015-01-17 at 5.19.57 pm.png|...into...\nScreen Shot 2015-01-17 at 5.20.03 pm.png|...Marzipan\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
