After that, he made cameos in ''[[Duck Pimples]]'' and the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' short film ''[[Bird Brained Donald]]''.\n\n==Role in the short==\nIn the short, the gorilla escaped from confinement and found its way to [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s house. Before that though, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] were attempting to scare Donald by dressing up as Ajax. Unfortunately, the prank took a turn for the worse when the real gorilla actually showed up. Donald, unaware that the gorilla was real, mistook it for the boys only to realize Huey, Dewey, and Louie weren't wearing the costume anymore. Enraged, the ape chased the ducks throughout the house. When it cornered Donald, however, the boys launched tear gas into the room, causing both Donald and the gorilla to swell up in tears. Then they both cry together as the short ends.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
