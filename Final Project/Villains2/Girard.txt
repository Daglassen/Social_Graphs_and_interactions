He saw [[D'Artagnan]] kissing his sister, and challenged D'Artagnan to a duel to protect his sister's honor. During the duel, D'Artagnan tried to convince Girard that nothing happened from what he saw and that he was innocent. D'Artagnan tried to explain that he told his sister he was leaving to travel to [[France]] and she wanted to give him something to remember her by. Nevertheless,\u00a0Girald thinks D'Artagnan's a liar and proceeds to insulting D'Artagnan and his late, great musketeer father, calling\u00a0the latter\u00a0a \"disgrace,\" angering D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan wins the duel after a short fight, and as Girard thinks he is about to be killed, he\u00a0tells D'Artagnan that his brothers will avenge him. D'Artagnan, seeing his four brothers riding towards them already, flees. Girard and his brothers pursue D'Artagnan, but he manages to lose them after a long chase.\n\nLater, Girard and his brothers arrive in Paris to look for D'Artagnan when Girard manages to spot him on the streets. He tries to go after D'Artagnan but the latter manages to escape by hiding in the crowd.\n\nGirard and his brothers next see D'Artagnan as the latter is about to be executed by [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Girard laughs and sarcastically tells D'Artagnan \"Don't lose your head!\" After [[Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]] rescue D'Artagnan, Girard and his brothers attempt to follow them, but they lose them again, with Girard\u00a0shouting out \"D'Artagnan\" in despair.\n\nAt the end of the film, shortly after D'Artagnan is officially made a musketeer, Girard and his brothers challenge D'Artagnan to an immediate duel. D'Artagnan tells his friends that he will take care of this problem and Porthos stops him from continuing, stating that in addition to protecting King and country, musketeers protect each other. Girard and his brothers are then chased off by the entire division of musketeers. He is the last to retreat.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nGirard Close Up.jpg|Girard during D'Artagnan's execution\ngirardagain.jpg|Girard and his brothers here for a final showdown with D'Artagnan\ngirardhonor.jpg|\"My sister's honor will not wait a moment longer!\"\ngirardmad.jpg|Girard intrigued\ngirardsissy.jpg|Girard realizing he is vastly outnumbered.\ngirardrun.jpg|\"Run!\"\ngirardbrothersrun.jpg|Girard and his brothers running\ngirardchase.jpg|Girard and his brothers chased by the Musketeers\ngirarddefeat.jpg|Girard (and his brothers') defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Three Musketeers}}\n[[Category:The Three Musketeers characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:French characters]]"
