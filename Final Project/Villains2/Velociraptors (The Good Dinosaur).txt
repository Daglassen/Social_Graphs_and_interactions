They are the tertiary antagonists of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2015]] animated feature film, ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''.\n\n\n\n==Background==\n===Official Description===\n:\"Raptors prey on the prized herd of longhorns that belong to Butch and his Tyrannosaurus Rex family. Raptors\u2014or Rustlers, as Butch calls them\u2014sport wiry, feathered bodies and hardly compare in size or strength to a T-Rex. But as a group, the Raptors pose quite a threat, and even a T-Rex may need to call in reinforcements before tangling with them.<ref>[http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/pixars-the-good-dinosaur-we-know-so-little-yet-expect-so-much.php Pixar\u2019s The Good Dinosaur: We Know So Little, Yet Expect So Much]</ref>\n\n===Members===\n<tabber>\nBubbha=\n'''Bubbha''' (voiced by [[Dave Boat]]) is the leader of the Velociraptors who has blue and purple skin.\n|-|Lurleane=\n'''Lurleane '''(voiced by Carrie Paff) is the only female Velociraptor of Bubbha\u2019s gang who has light red skin and hears Bubbha.\n|-|Pervis=\n'''Pervis '''(voiced by Mackenzie Grant) is the dumbest Velociraptor of Bubbha\u2019s gang who has light-gray skin and big teeth.\n|-|Earl=\n'''Earl '''(voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) is the unhinged one liner Velociraptor who has light blue skin. He is coverd with dirty feathers.\n</tabber>\n\n===Development===\nDuring early development of ''The Good Dinosaur'' where the world is equivalent to modern times, a deleted scene titled \"Raptor Trap\" would have featured the Velociraptors being demanded to rescue Butch who was tied up while Arlo makes a distraction plan to capture them in a large net, successfully capturing them and rescuing Butch. For the final version of the film, the directors have decided to keep the frontier elements without making fun of them, giving the Velociraptors a unique taunting tone in the final version.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''===\nThey first appear when [[Arlo]] alerts them to his presence by screaming after getting bitten on the leg by [[Spot]], [[Bubbha]] asks him what he's doing, [[Arlo]] nervously replies that he is doing nothing, but [[Earl (The Good Dinosaur)|Earl]] suggests otherwise, and says to him that any trespassers must be killed, but [[Butch (The Good Dinosaur)|Butch]], [[Nash and Ramsey]] come in to counter-attack, [[Pervis]] starts to attack Arlo first, while Bubbha goes for Nash, but Ramsey saves him from Bubbha, while [[Lurleane]] and Pervis pin Butch, Arlo attacks them, then they try to attack him back, but they get defeated by Butch throwing Lurleane and Pervis away, also with Bubbha and Earl retreating and nearly getting his tail bitten off by Butch in which Arlo, Butch, and Nash and Ramsey roar at them to prevent the Velociraptors from stealing the longhorn herd and from coming back. They are not seen again for the rest of the film.\n\n===''[[The Good Dinosaur: Dino Crossing|Dino Crossing]]''===\nVelociraptors appear as non-playable characters throughout the game. They only appear in Level 7 of Journey Mode and in Endless Mode as obstacles that the player must avoid. Depending whether the player is controlling Arlo or Spot individually or Arlo and Spot together, touching either one of them causes the player to lose a life or an instant game over.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Earl is one of the least recognizable portrayals of [[John Ratzenberger]], next to [[Mustafa]],  Juan Ortodoncia and Gordon (from ''Brave'') due to having one line and speaking with a southern accent.\n*Pervis strongly resembles [[Nuka]], the secondary antagonist of ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', as well Ed from the first Lion King.\n*Their portrayal in the movie is fairly accurate. Fossils do show evidence that Velociraptors did indeed have feathers. However, the feathers covered their entire bodies minus the exception of the snout, unlike the movie in which only a few sections of their body are covered with feathers.\n*Unlike how they were portrayed in the Movie, Velociraptors didn't live in America, they lived in Asia from the Gobi Desert's Djadochta Formation.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional Material===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" orientation=\"none\">\nBubba.png|Bubbha\nLurleane .png|Lurleane\nPervis Promo 1.jpg|Pervis\nEarl_Profile.png|Earl\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" navigation=\"true\">\nThe_Good_Dinosaur_61.jpg|Bubbha with his pack facing [[Arlo]] and [[Spot (The Good Dinosaur)|Spot]]\nRustlers435657.png\nPervis shut your mouth.PNG\nPervis_shut_your_mouth.PNG|\"Pervis!
