He is a rouge [[chanul]] who causes people to misbehave.\n\n==Role in the series==\nSanza is a chanul who went bad and instead of giving people good advice, he talks them into causing trouble. He first appears with Guillermo and convinces him to help ruin D\u00eda de los Muertos. They start causing chaos, but Elena spots them and tells them to stop. When Elena mentions the [[Spirit World]] Sanza says there's an even bigger party to crash and then he teleports Guillermo and himself there.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSanza, Shuriki and Hetz.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*His color is an indication that when chanuls go rouge, they turn green.\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Jaguars]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
