His unique ability is to spread Malice when performing combos and certain Strong Attacks. His Unique Action will have Ganon absorb Malice back into his body, filling the Malice gauge. Filling it completely will have him enter his Calamity form where he gains new powerful combos. Either string will not only stagger strong enemies and bosses but expose their Weak Point on hit.
