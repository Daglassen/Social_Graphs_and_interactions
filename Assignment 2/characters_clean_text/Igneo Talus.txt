Igneo Talus are recurring Bosses in The Legend of Zelda series. They are a fiery variant of Stone Talus.

=== Breath of the Wild ===

Igneo Talus's attack patterns are much the same as its more commonly encountered stone counterpart, however, if Link comes into direct contact with it, he will catch fire. To prevent this, he can wear Flamebreaker Armor that has been enhanced twice by a Great Fairy for the Fireproof Effect, or attack the Talus with ice weapons to cool it down temporarily.
An Igneo Talus is large and slow-moving, with its main attacks being to launch pieces of its arms at Link, crash down in an attempt to fall on him, and take a ponderous swing at the hero if he is close enough. To hurt it, he must hit the piece of Ore protruding from its body. This can be accomplished by climbing onto it when it falls over, using a longer range Weapon if the Ore is low enough or by using a Bow to hit it with Arrows. This can be accomplished more easily by using the Remote Bomb Rune to blow off one of its arms, causing it to lose its balance and fall.
The Ore on Igneo Talus can occasionally drop Flint, Opals, Rubies, and Diamonds when struck. When defeated, Igneo Talus will drop a large quantity of these Materials. Defeating all Igneo Taluses, as well as all other Talus varieties, will result in Kilton giving Link the Medal of Honor: Talus as a reward. This can only be obtained after defeating Calamity Ganon.
The Igneo Talus at Darunia Lake must be defeated to complete the Side Quest "The Road to Respect", which is given by Fugo in Goron City.
