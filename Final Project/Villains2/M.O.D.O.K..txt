MODOK is the supreme leader of the current A.I.M. and former leader of the Cabal in ''[[Avengers Assemble]]''.\n\nMODOK was created by\u00a0[[Stan Lee]]\u00a0and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Personality==\n\nMODOK looks highly toward himself, priding his high intelligence. He has low regard for the weak-minded and treats the greater minds with disdain. When cooperating with genius like himself, he will only work with them to serve his own ends.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]] ''===\n\nIn this show, MODOK's acronym is MODOC, with the 'C' standing for \"Conquest\". MODOC is the leader of [[A.I.M.|Advanced Idea Mechanics]], a terrorist organization. He took part in the experiment that transformed Simon Williams into the Wonder Man.\nLater on in the series, A.I.M. starts a war against Hydra when they realized the Cosmic Cube they created for them was more powerful than expected. When the Cosmic Cube is just finished, a Hydra ship attacks A.I.M.'s, MODOC fights Hydra leader [[Baron Strucker]], and is defeated by Hydra's Dreadnoughts.\n\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\n\nIn the episode \"Beetle Mania\", when several of [[Beetle]]'s felonies are shown, one of the scenes shown is Beetle freeing MODOK from prison.\u00a0His only major role took place in \"Contest of Champions (Part 3)\" where he is a prisoner of the [[Grandmaster]].\n\n===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===\n\n[[File:MODOK_Avengers_Assemble.png|thumb|180px|MODOK as he appears in ''Avengers Assemble'']]\nMODOK appears as an ally of [[Red Skull]] in in \"The Avengers Initiative\" where he helps Red Skull by disabling [[Iron Man]] and capturing [[Captain America]] at the Statue of Liberty. While in a [[HYDRA]] Base in Antarctica, MODOK operated a machine that would swap Red Skull's mind with Captain America's but the Avengers invaded the base and undid the body swap. MODOK gets away with Red Skull who swipes Iron Man's armor. When the Avengers regroup at Avengers Mansion, MODOK uses microbots to control the bodies of Captain America, [[Black Widow]], [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]], [[Hawkeye]], [[Hulk]], and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] while Red Skull targets the Arc Reactor in Avengers Mansion. Iron Man figures out how the microbots work and frees everyone from the microbots control leaving Hulk to beat up MODOK. MODOK gets away with Red Skull after Hulk, Thor, and Falcon sent the detonating Arc Reactor higher in the sky so that it wouldn't destroy Manhattan. On Red Skull's submarine, MODOK witnesses Red Skull sending a message to every supervillain to join his Cabal in a plan to destroy the Avengers.\n\n===''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]] ''===\nA comedic version of MODOK appears as one of the villains\u00a0in the special.\n\nIn the special, he briefly meets the [[Giant Floating Baby Head]] passing by him, but simply shrugs at the confusing event.\n\n===''[[M.O.D.O.K. (TV series)|M.O.D.O.K.]]''===\nMODOK is the star of his own series, depicted in a mature comedic way. MODOK is now a family man with a human wife and son named Jodie and Lou and a similar daughter to him named Melissa. Much of the series depicts his problems at A.I.M. with his co-workers, his attempts to be the top villain and trying to save his crumbling marriage. As the series progresses MODOK comes to appreciate the various nuances in his life that he initially took for granted as he tries to get back with Jodie and save his job at A.I.M.\n\nIn \"The M.O.D.O.K. That Time Forgot\", MODOK takes Jodie back in time to take her to a Third Eye Blind concert they missed while they were in college because they found out they were having Melissa. He ends up fighting with his college aged self and scars him with pieces of a time crystal and displacing him, though in the process he and Jodie become trapped in the past. They wait until they catch up with their younger selves and prevent them from traveling back, but forget to tell them to hang on to their lives and MODOK ends up moving out with the [[Super-Adaptoid]].\n\nHe continues to spend time with his children while also scheming ways to win Jodie back. When he learns that she is dating Wonder Man, he becomes depressed, but becomes more determined. Wonder Man ends up breaking things off with Jodie when she begins to display habits that are similar to MODOK. He ends up having to rescue his family from the younger MODOK, dubbed the Anomaly and Arcade while also dealing with robotic duplicates. Ultimately, MODOK returns home with the real Jodie, Melissa, Lou and an extra Lou whom they accept as family. At the Lous' Bar Mitzvah, MODOK and his family are attacked by the Anomaly, but time is stopped so that he can show MODOK their future. It turns out that the only way for MODOK to be a success is if his family dies; giving him the motivation to complete his conquest. In the far future, Emperor MODOK has successfully defeated the Avengers and is trying to find a way to bring his family to him.\n\n==Other appearances==\n===Marvel vs. Capcom series===\n\nMODOK appears as a playable character in the [[Capcom]] crossover fighting game ''Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds'', and also makes a cameo in the background of a playable stage in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the unaired pilot for ''[[New Warriors (TV series)|New Warriors]]'', the series would have introduced a character named '''Ernest Vigman''' who would have been played by [[Keith David]]. Series showrunner, Kevin Biegel, revealed that he would have become MODOK had the series been produced.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMODOK (Avengers EMH).png|MODOK in ''Earth's Mightiest Heroes''.\nMission Marvel - M.O.D.O.K..png|MODOK in [[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]\nVillains cause mayhem.jpg\nStompingflowerbed.jpg\nAvengers assemble2.jpg\nMODOK, Red Skull and Doof.jpg\nPerry to the Rescue.jpg\nMODOK.png\nMODOK USM.png|MODOK in ''Ultimate Spider-Man''\nCrosswalk.jpg\nGiant Baby Head - Mission Marvel.jpg|MODOK strangely sees the [[Giant Floating Baby Head]] pass by.\nMODOK01.png\nModok-DWA.jpg|MODOK in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''\nDisney INFINITY Loki and MODOK.png\nVenom-RedSkull-MODOK-and-Whiplash.jpg\nHeinz-RedSkull-Venom-MODOK-and-Whiplash.jpg\nRedSkull-Venom-MODOK-Heinz-andWhiplash.JPEG\nModok MDWTA Chart.png\nThe Cabal.png|Modok with the Cabal\nAvengers.Assemble.S01E21.jpg\nMODOCK robot suite.png|MODOK via [[Super-Adaptoid]]\nM.O.D.O.K..png|[[LEGO]] M.O.D.O.K.\nMODOK TV MODOK.jpg\nM.O.D.O.K Family.webp|M.O.D.O.K and his family\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Psychics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:M.O.D.O.K. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
