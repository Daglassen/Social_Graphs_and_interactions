It was a major antagonist in the third season of ''[[Amphibia]]''. \n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nIt can speak in a robotic voice while also serve as King Andrias' assassin killer machine to terminate Anne, as well as pick up a copy of ''Cynthia Coven'', all while avoiding detection from anyone else to prevent knowledge of its master's invasion from being exposed by its presence.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThis type has a silver and grey green paint job, is lanky and thin to quickly maneuver in urban areas, and has razor-sharp claws attached to 2 long arms. It has a horn that curves backwards at the top of its head. Its optics are normally bright red (though they can turn blue) and its normally horizontal pupils can change shape depending on its mood. It has tubes on its torso sides as well as 2 different size tubes attached to the blue light part and has long shoulder pads.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nIt has stealth mode that is an active camouflage which can hide itself from plain sight on Earth while walking around during daylight, however magnets can affect the camouflage systems and anything on that Frog-bot even when that camouflage is activated would be exposed. It's left claw could change into a plasma-based weaponry. When it's got badly damaged, it could do self repair by its claws that acted like blow torches.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cloak-Bot is voiced by Troy Baker, who also voices [[Captain Grime]].\n*Some closed captions mislabel it as [[Frobo]].\n*In \"[[Spider-Sprig]]\", Robert Otto uses its arm to fight Sprig.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAmphibia season 3 poster.jpg\nThe New Normal Concept art 6 by Joe Sparrow.jpg|Concept Art\nSilver Frog-Bot In Intro.png|Cloak-Bot in Intro\nThe New Normal 5.png|Cloak-Bot Official Debut\nThe-New-Normal00552.png|Cloak-Bot confused\nThe New Normal 8.png|Cloak-Bot becoming invisible\nThe New Normal 9.png\nThe New Normal 10.png\nThe New Normal 11.png\nThe-New-Normal01052.png\nThe-New-Normal01075.png\nThe-New-Normal heavy damage.png\nThe-New-Normal self repair .png|Cloak-Bot repairing itself\nFight at the Museum (19).jpg\nFight at the Museum (24).jpg\nFight at the Museum (26).jpg\nFight at the Museum (28).jpg\nFight at the Museum (29).jpg\nFight at the Museum (30).jpg\nFight at the Museum (34).jpg\nFight at the Museum (35).jpg\nFight at the Museum (36).jpg\nCloak-Bot using construction equipment and hardware tools as replacement parts.png|Cloak-Bot using construction equipment and hardware tools as replacement parts\nAnne-sterminator (7).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (12).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (15).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (16).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (17).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (18).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (21).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (23).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (24).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (25).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (26).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (30).jpg|Cloak-Bot is destroyed\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Cloak-Bot|Cloak-Bot]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia|Amphibia Wiki]]\n*[https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Cloak-Bot Cloak-Bot] at the [https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page Villains Wiki]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]"
