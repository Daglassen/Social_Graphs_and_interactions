Ripped me from my mother's arms, murdered my brother, used me as a weapon and then cast me aside. Abandoned me. Once, I had power, now I have nothing. Nothing.|Maul|Twilight of the Apprentice}}\n'''Maul''', formerly '''Darth Maul''', is a major antagonist in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. He first appears as an antagonist of ''Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'', returning in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and later in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. He also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Solo]]'', under the alias \"Crimson Dawn\".\n\nIn ''The Phantom Menace'', Maul serves as the first apprentice of [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]], secretly known as Darth Sidious, a mysterious [[Sith|Sith Master]] who is manipulating galactic events from behind the scenes. Wielding a double-bladed [[lightsaber]], and trained as a master of lightsaber combat, Maul serves as a personal assassin for Palpatine, having been sent to eliminate [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], two of the film's protagonists. He succeeds in slaying Qui-Gon, but he is then sliced in half by Obi-Wan.\n\nWhile the Jedi presumed him dead, Maul was shown to have survived in the ''The Clone Wars'' series, because of his hatred for Kenobi. After his mind and legs were restored by Talzin, Maul was reunited with his brother, Savage Opress, and continued his goal to get revenge on Kenobi as well as overthrow and destroy Sidious. In ''Star Wars Rebels'', Maul still lived to sought revenge on his enemies, including Emperor Palpatine and his apprentice, [[Darth Vader]]. After learning that Obi-Wan Kenobi was still alive, Maul began looking for his archenemy, eventually tracking him down on [[Tatooine]], where he was finally killed by Kenobi, this time for good.\n\n==Background==\nMaul was born on [[Dathomir]] as the son of Mother Talzin of the Nightsisters. He lived during the last days of the [[Galactic Republic]] and the eve of the reign of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Maul eventually was taken by Darth Sidious as a Sith apprentice, and given the name Darth Maul. Sidious' training methods were often unforgiving and harsh.\n\n===Personality===\nMaul's life and motivations are based on revenge. As a Sith Lord, Maul seeks revenge against the Jedi for their triumph over the Sith and wants to return the [[Sith|Sith Order]] to power over the galaxy. So, after his exile and the restoration of his mind, Maul turned his thoughts of revenge towards the galaxy (declaring himself and his brother the true Sith), especially towards Obi-Wan as the Jedi defeated him and forced him into exile after the war on [[Naboo]]. He felt the vacuum of losing power, having known about the Clone Wars and intending to be part of it, only to learn that the Sith plans moved on without him. Maul was therefore willing to go to great lengths to achieve his vengeance, including slaughtering civilians and thrusting [[Mandalore]] into civil war to gain power and draw Obi-Wan out into the open.\n\nAt times, Maul is animalistic, as evidenced by his ability to snarl and growl like a wild beast. This occasionally allows him to psychologically unnerve his opponents.\n\nMaul is often overconfident, a trait that leads to him underestimating his opponents. As a result, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka Tano and Kanan Jarrus all were able to get the drop on him at one point or another in spite of his formidable skills. In his duel on Mandalore, he believe he could persuade Tano into joining him against Darth Sidious, and nearly convinced her to join him. However, she refused when he revealed that Anakin would have to die in order for them to accomplish their goal. As Maul wanted her to join him, he also refrained from wanting to kill her, ultimately giving Ahsoka the openings she needed to defeat him.\n\nDuring Maul's exile, his mind was shattered. He became obsessed with revenge, kept alive only by his hatred for Obi-Wan for his aggression and fear increased in his crazed condition, as he brutally attacked Savage when he first encountered his brother on Lotho Minor. It was required the skills of Talzin to restore his mind, bringing him clarity again while still preserving his desire to seek revenge against those who had wronged him.\n\nMaul's power made him crave dominance over the Sith and the galaxy, though he is shown to recognize the power that [[Palpatine]] possesses that Maul does not. Maul feared his former master when Palpatine arrived on Mandalore, and begged for mercy after Palpatine bested him in a lightsaber duel. After the electrocution that Palpatine subjected him to on Mandalore, he later told Death Watch that he had become indifferent to pain.\n\nHowever, despite Maul's ruthless and vindictive personality, he is not completely heartless. He expressed compassion for his brother, Savage Opress, and their mother, the Dathomir Witch Talzin. Although he is not always seen getting along with Savage, they showed to genuinely care for each other. When Savage was killed by Palpatine, Maul was grief-stricken and briefly mourned him before flying into a rage and attempting to avenge him. He is extremely loyal to his mother and reciprocated her loving and protective affection for him. Even when cornered by Palpatine and his minions, he refused to leave her behind and was greatly devastated by her death. Even after sixteen years, Maul still held an extremely bitter grudge against Palpatine and all those who served him for taking everything he cared about from him. He also developed a slight fondness for [[Ezra Bridger]], seeing great potential in the boy's abilities, desiring him as an apprentice, and even saving his life twice. However, despite any meager affection, he ultimately sought to manipulate Ezra and use him to further his own agenda.\n\nBy the events of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', Maul remained a bitter and vengeful individual, who sought revenge upon his former master and all those who wronged him for all the suffering they caused him throughout his life. Although he still carries a red lightsaber and practices their beliefs, Maul disassociated himself from the Sith, evidenced by the fact that he has dropped the title of \"Darth\" from his name. Cunning and deceptive, Maul is willing to feign weakness to accomplish his purposes, or even side with the Jedi if necessary. When he learned that his old enemy Obi-Wan was still alive, he decided to settle his accounts once and for all, which ultimately led to Maul's death. In his final moments, he at last came to terms with his fate and knew that in death, he and his kind would be avenged when the Sith were finally destroyed.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''[[The Force|Power of the Force]]:''' Maul has an extremely strong connection to the Force, being one of the most powerful Force-users of his time. Notably, his powers in the dark side of the Force were also augmented after his injuries, due to his extreme hatred for [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Additionally, even [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]] considered Maul a rival.\n**'''Telekinesis:''' Maul can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. After Maul's return, he demonstrated enough telekinetic strength to pull a small space shuttle off of a cliff while fleeing from pirates, and fueled by pure desperation.\n***'''Force Push:''' Maul can telekinetically send his opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed. This was demonstrated when Maul did it to Obi-Wan on [[Naboo]].\n***'''Force Pull:''' Maul can telekinetically pull his opponents or objects towards him.\n***'''Force Choke:''' Maul can telekinetically choke his opponents to either weaken, kill or intimidate them.\n***'''Force Grip:''' Maul can telekinetically lift his opponents off the ground and into the air, sometimes by the neck, to immobilize them. When focusing his rage, he is able to telekinetically grab and suspend opponents without even looking at them or exerting much concentration on them to maintain the effect, as he did when holding Satine Kryze in the air by the neck.\n***'''Force Crush:''' Maul utilizes Force Crush to crush objects or droids. During Order 66, Maul's power with the dark side was strong enough to allow him to crush and collapse a starcruiser's hyperspace engines of a starship with enough effort, subsequently crippling the entire ship.\n***'''Force Throw:''' Maul can telekinetically cause objects and other individuals, to be hurled toward a target at an astounding velocity.\n***'''Force Repel:''' Maul can unleash a wave of pure Force energy that knocks back anything within the power's blast radius or pushes multiple opponents simultaneously.\n***'''Saber Throw:''' Maul can telekinetically guide his lightsaber towards his opponents and return the weapon back to his hand, similar to a boomerang or shuriken.\n***'''Force Deflection:''' Maul can telekinetically redirect incoming attacks such as blaster bolts, with or without his lightsaber, although it is difficult to do so. He notably was able to telekinetically direct blasterfire away from himself during the time of Order 66, when the power of the dark side of the Force became more dominant over the galaxy.\n**'''Telepathy:''' Maul can telepathically communicate with other individuals over small or vast distances. Due to a ritual that combined a Jedi and Sith holocron, Maul's mind became linked to [[Ezra Bridger]], which he quickly learned to exploit by causing the young Jedi to experience hallucinations and visions of him, although the two were physically separate.\n***'''Mind Trick:''' Maul can control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills.\n***'''Mind Probe:''' Maul can telepathically sense and sift through the thoughts and memories of other sentient beings for the purpose of interrogation or torture, although another Force-user can potentially resist this power. As such, he was able to read [[Hera Syndulla]]'s mind when he sought information on the whereabouts of [[Kanan Jarrus]]' [[Holocron]].\n**'''Force Vision:''' Maul can see visions of the past, present, and future. However, like all Force-users, his visions are not always clear or sometimes they happen without warning. He notably is shown to experience premonitions during the Clone Wars, as he foresaw his potential when allying himself with Deathwatch to gain power.\n**'''Force Sense:''' Maul can sense another sentient being's emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users.\n**'''Focused Rage:''' Maul can channel his anger to amplify his strength, durability, endurance, speed, ferocity, aggression, and the potency of his combat prowess/attacks.\n**'''Force Jump:''' Maul can jump or leap at great distances. He was seen using this to leap onto a bridge.\n**'''Force Dash:''' Maul can move at amazing speeds.\n\n====Abilities====\n*'''Master Lightsaber Duelist:''' Maul is a highly skilled lightsaber duelist, as he is one of the deadliest lightsaber duelists of his time. Very few were able to match him in lightsaber combat, with [[Ahsoka Tano]] and Obi-Wan being among them. In his duel with Ahsoka at the very end of the Clone Wars, Maul was evenly matched with her, and was caught unaware by her more aggressive combat style. Additionally, Maul was unable to control his overconfidence against Ahsoka, which was one reason she was able to best him. By the time of the events of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', despite Maul's great lightsaber combat skills, he is fully aware of his limitations. He knew that if he was to face [[Anakin Skywalker]]/[[Darth Vader]] or [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine/Darth Sidious]] directly, he would not prevail. However, he was not afraid of facing the members of the [[Inquisitorius]], knowing full well that he is more than a match for any of them. This is evidenced when he killed the [[Seventh Sister]] and the [[Fifth Brother]] relatively easily. Despite Maul's old age, he is still able to keep up with opponents, who are much younger than he is. In \"[[Twin Suns]]\", in Maul's final confrontation against [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], despite the fact that the elderly Jedi Master had gone approximately sixteen years without a duel or practice, Maul was only able to last a few seconds against him before being mortally wounded by Obi-Wan and dying from his injury.\n**'''Form III:''' Maul has some skill in Soresu.\n**'''Form IV:''' Maul is highly skilled in Ataru.\n**'''Form VI:''' Maul is a master of Niman.\n**'''Form VII:''' Maul is extremely skilled in Juyo.\n**'''Jar'Kai:''' Maul is highly skilled in Jar'Kai.\n*'''Skilled Pilot:''' Maul is highly skilled in piloting most speeders, and most types of flying crafts.\n*'''Indomitable Will/High Tolerance For Pain/Expert Survivalist:''' Maul has an indomitable will and a high tolerance for pain, as he was able to survive being cut in half. Many years later, he also survived a long drop off the [[Malachor Sith Temple]] without any injuries.\n*'''Genius-Level Intellect/Master Tactician/Manipulator/Leader:''' Maul is extremely intelligent and wise. He is a capable manipulator, a skilled tactician. He also has political skills from his time as Palpatine's apprentice, managing to form the Shadow Collective in a surprisingly short amount of time, allowing him to seize control over the Galactic criminal underworld and subsequent rule over the Outer Rim.\n\n===Weapons and Equipment===\n====Lightsabers====\nMaul's valued weapon and possessions are his red and black-bladed lightsabers. He has had three lightsabers.\n*'''[[Lightsaber|First Double-bladed lightsaber]]:''' Maul had a double-bladed red lightsaber which he used during his early years as a Sith. It was sliced in half by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and fell along with Maul down the pit on [[Naboo]]. During the Clone Wars, Maul used the still functional half of the lightsaber to fight Obi-Wan, Pre Vizla, and [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]]. He eventually rebuilt it to serve as a double-bladed weapon sometime after he escaped imprisonment by Darth Sidious. He lost it after he was captured by Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex on Mandalore.\n*'''[[Darksaber]]:''' During the Clone Wars, Maul took Pre Vizsla's Darksaber as his own after slaying him in a leadership duel. He fought against Palpatine, and later General Grievous with it. It was eventually taken by [[Sabine Wren]] on [[Dathomir]], who claimed the weapon as her own since it had belonged to the [[Mandalorian]]s and was by that extent rightfully hers.\n*'''[[Lightsaber|Second Double-bladed lightsaber]]:''' By the time of the events of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', Maul had obtained a new double-bladed red lightsaber. This lightsaber had a spike on one side of the hilt, allowing Maul to use the weapon as a part of his walking stick, which the lightsaber fit into when not in use. Based on its design, it is likely that Maul took it from an Inquisitor he killed and modified it for his own use. It would remain in Maul's possession until his death, being destroyed when Obi-Wan cut it in two during their final duel, fatally slashing Maul across the chest in the same blow.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Star Wars: The Phantom Menace''===\n[[File:The-phantom-menace-darth-maul-double-bladed-lightsaber-1920x816.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maul ready to fight Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.]]\nDarth Maul was an apprentice to the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. He is first seen as a hologram before Nute Gunray and Rune Haako, and was then sent to kill Jedi [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] so that they could not interfere in the Invasion of Naboo. Sidious instructed him to move against them before the Queen so taking her into custody would be easier. He flies to [[Tatooine]] and used probes to locate the Jedi. When one of the probes return, Maul then boards a speeder and attacked Qui-Gon in the desert, intending to finish him and then kill Obi-Wan. However, Qui-Gon fought back and escaped with his allies aboard his fighter, foiling Maul's attempts.\n\nSoon after, Sidious sent him to Naboo to assist the Trade Federation and destroy the Jedi, having been instructed to let the Naboo make the first move. After they enter the room he was in, he confronts them and the three Force-users begin to duel. The ferocious clash leads them into the Theed Generator Complex, where Maul separates Obi-Wan via energy walls and fought Qui-Gon near a melting pit. Maul defeated and killed the latter by stunning him with a jab to his torso. Obi-Wan pounced on the Sith Lord furiously, eventually destroying one half of Maul's double-bladed lightsaber. However, this left him vulnerable to a sudden counterattack that ended with Darth Maul Force-pushing him over the edge of a vast reactor shaft. However, Obi-Wan grabbed on to a power nozzle and calmed himself. Maul kicked Obi-Wan's lightsaber into the shaft. As Maul began to taunt him, Obi-Wan used the Force to grab Qui-Gon's lightsaber and jumped up behind him, slicing him in half and sending him tumbling down the shaft to his presumed death.\n\n===''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''===\n[[File:Maul Return.png|thumb|250px|Maul more than ten years after being cut in half.]]\nAfter years of thinking Maul was dead, the Jedi, as well as viewers, were surprised to see him alive, fueled by his hatred for Obi-Wan. He was found by his brother Savage Oppress on the junk planet of Lotho Minor, who saved him from his fate and helped him get cybernetic legs and have his sanity restored by the leader of the Nightsisters; Mother Talzin. Together, they sought revenge against Obi-Wan Kenobi. Maul began his revenge by revealing to Kenobi he was alive. An alliance he tried to make with pirates went wrong resulting in Savage being wounded and his legs being damaged.\n\nMaul eventually returned to health with aid from Pre-Vizsla and the Mandalorian Death Watch before forming a crime syndicate called the Shadow Collective, helping Vizsla to reclaim [[Mandalore]] using the collective, while secretly plotting to take over. The final part of his revenge was killing the only woman Obi-Wan ever loved, Duchess Satine, while he watched in horror. After killing Pre-Vizla in an honor duel and taking control of Mandalore as its leader, Maul's old master, Darth Sidious, arrived and fought both of them, seeing Maul as a rival despite the Zabrak's protests. He was able to kill Savage, and then engaged Maul briefly before disarming and electrocuting him. However, Sidious stated he wouldn't kill Maul as he had \"other uses for him\".\n\n[[File:Maul VS Sidious.png|left|thumb|250px|Maul duels Darth Sidious.]]\nAs revealed in the 4-part comic series \"Son of Dathomir\", Maul eventually escaped Sidious' clutches with aid from his Mandalorian loyalists. Maul's forces on the Mandalorian Death Watch were eventually overrun by General Grievous, and Maul was forced to retreat. Maul then sought Mother Talzin's aid. Talzin told Maul to raise an army from the Shadow collective and his old clan; the Nightbrothers. Though his use of deceit and trickery, Maul successfully captured General Grievous and Count Dooku. Maul then tempted Dooku into joining him against Sidious, hoping to lure him to Mother Talzin on Dathomir. Upon reaching Dathomir, Maul and Talzin tried to sacrifice Dooku so that Talzin (who revealed herself to be Maul's biological mother) could return to physical form (as her previous form had been destroyed by Mace Windu). However, the arrival of Sidious and Grievous halted their plans and after a duel in which Talzin sacrificed herself to allow Maul to escape, Maul fled, his plans in ruins, his army destroyed and in Sidious' eyes, no longer a threat or a Sith Lord.\n\nIn the seventh season, Maul and other parts of his loyal forces returned to Mandalore and at this time, continued to rule over the organizations that remained loyal to him. Among them was forging ties with the criminal organization, Crimson Dawn, and the Pyke Syndicate, where he contacted the new leader, Marg Krim and wondering why Republic forces are uncovering their spice mining operation. Coincidentally, Ahsoka Tano is also there, spying on them, and Maul felt her presence. However, he is unable to spot her and he warns Krim to risk no more delays or else Crimson Dawn would take control of their operations before ending the transmission.\n[[File:Darth Maul 7x10 16-21.jpg|thumb|326x326px|Maul confronts Ahsoka on Mandalore.]]\nHe confronts Ahsoka when she and her forces arrive on Mandalore and was hoping for Obi-Wan and his former Padawan, [[Anakin Skywalker]] and warns her of a new power rising to take over the Republic, led by Darth Sidious. However, Maul escapes from Ahsoka and later captures the ARC trooper Jesse, where he orders Gar Saxon to kill Almec before he can become an asset to the enemy. He begins to torture Jesse and probes for information on Ahsoka. Through the clone, Maul becomes aware of Ahsoka's trial and her departure from the Jedi Order. Later knowing what is to come, he tells the other leaders of the Shadow Collective to hide out. With the presence of Rook Kast, and Gar Saxon, he recalls how they saved him from Sidious' imprisonment and rallies them to fight or die trying. Later, Maul sits upon the Mandalorian throne, confronting Rex, Ahsoka and Bo-Katan, who Maul briefly chokes when she tries to kill him. As a show of good faith, Maul sets Jesse free and allows him to return to Rex, who Ahsoka tells to get Jesse to safety and Bo-Katan goes to help her people when Maul's forces begin attacking them. Alone with Ahsoka, Maul revealed he knew she left the Jedi Order because they turned from her during her trials. He tells Ahsoka that Sidious will rise into power and knows that no one can defeat Sidious and offers her a chance to jin him. Ahsoka accepts, until she learns that Maul intended to lure Anakin to Mandalore and kill him to deprive Sidious of an apprentice. The two engage in a duel that is fierce and short, during which Maul recognizes that she had been trained by Obi-Wan, to which she retorted that Maul would come to dislike many things about her. The duel continues for a few moments more before Maul is thrown out the window by Ahsoka, whereupon he attempts to flee. However, Ahsoka chases the former Sith into the rafters of the city dome and overpowers Maul with her abilities, causing him to fall before clones capture him and stun Maul. As he is captured, Maul screams in terror, begging for them to let him die as he knows Sidious is about to enact his master plan. \n\nAhsoka decides to take him back to Coruscant, but Order 66 is initiated, turning her clone troopers against her. Maul senses the disturbance in the force when Order 66 is enacted while in his cell. The clones go to execute the restrained Maul until he is rescued by Ahsoka, who only frees him so he can spread chaos. Maul attacks the clones and destroys the ship's main engines. Ahsoka tries to stop Maul from escaping, but he is able to use a shuttle and leave the Star Destroyer before it crashes onto the nearby moon.\n\n===''[[Solo]]''===\nMaul appears close to the end in ''Solo A Star Wars Story'', revealed to be the leader of [[Dryden Vos]]'s syndicate, Crimson Dawn.\n\n===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===\n[[File:Rebels Darth Maul 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Maul on [[Malachor]] in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.]]\nIn \"[[Twilight of the Apprentice]]\", it is revealed that Maul later fled to Malachor to get the Sith Holocron from the Sith Temple there and that he dropped the \"Darth\" title from his name. It is also revealed that sometime after Vader created the Imperial Inquisition the Emperor had Vader dispatch the [[Eighth Brother]] to hunt him and the Holocron down. Maul first appeared when Ezra landed near him. He helped Ezra get into the Sith Temple by teaching him to act upon his passionate and aggressive tendencies. After they retrieved the Holocron, Maul helped the Jedi fight off the Eighth Brother, [[Fifth Brother]], and [[Seventh Sister]]. After telling Ezra how to activate the Temple, Maul helps Kanan and Ahsoka kill the three Inquisitors. He then turns on and blinds Kanan with the intention of making Ezra his apprentice. Kanan recovers and drives Maul off, though Maul is able to escape the planet in one of the Inquisitor's [[TIE Advanced v1|TIE Fighters]]. He then heads to parts unknown.\n\nMaul returns in the episode \"[[The Holocrons of Fate]]\", in which he kidnaps the crew of the Ghost in order to bring Kanan and Ezra to him with the [[Holocron]] from Malachor so he can merge them, answer the question he seeks and glimpse the future. This prompted him to also try opening Kanan's Holocron to utilize its power, but as he could not call upon the light side of the Force, he was unsuccessful. Upon luring the Jedi to his location at a Mandalorian asteroid outpost, Maul promptly tried to kill Kanan once Ezra was out of sight by shooting him out of an airlock, which Kanan barely survived. Maul then, with Ezra's help, merged both Holocrons and looked for the answers to his question (hope) while Ezra sought the key to destroying the Sith. When Kanan urged Ezra to look away from what he was seeing, the resulting explosion caused Maul to be blasted away and then escape. As he fled in his starfighter, Maul realized the answer to his question from what he had seen in the holocrons; that his rival Obi-Wan Kenobi still lived.\n\n[[File:Starwars3x10 0459.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maul on [[Atollon]].]]\nIn \"[[Visions and Voices]]\", because of the ritual of the Holocrons, Maul and Ezra were somehow mentally bound, which allowed Maul to find the rebel base on [[Atollon]]. He approached Kanan and Ezra who was talking with [[The Bendu|the Bendu]] to propose to Ezra to come with him to break the link definitively. Initially reluctant, Ezra agreed and both left for Dathomir. Once they arrived, Maul revealed this was his homeworld and he is the last survivor of the clan. they made their way to the ancient fortress of the Nightsisters, Maul's deceased family, which was now used as a hidden lair for Maul. After fulfilling the ancient Nightsister ritual to break the mental bond between them, the spirits of the Nightsisters awoke and took control of Kanan and Sabine, who had followed Maul and Ezra. A battle then ignited between the two duets until Maul and Ezra escaped the cave, for the spirit could not follow because they were bound to the altar from which they drew their power. Maul suggested leaving but Ezra refused. Maul, exasperated by the sympathy and compassion of the young man towards his friends, told him that he had disappointed him and then left to find his old enemy, Obi-Wan.\n\n[[File:RIP Maul.png|thumb|250px|Maul dies in peace.]]\nIn \"[[Twin Suns]]\", Maul wandered in search of Obi-Wan on Tatooine, intent on seeking his revenge. He soon became lost in the desert and screamed Obi-Wan's name in vain, wondering if it was his destiny to die in the wastes of the planet. Regaining his determination, he continued in his search. Maul then set a trap for Ezra Bridger, luring him to a canyon with a piece of the Sith Holocron. After Ezra\u2019s ship was taken out by [[Tusken Raiders]], Maul intervened, slaying the Sand People before seemingly leaving Ezra alone and unharmed. As Ezra sought a way off-world and was caught in a sandstorm, Maul followed out of sight, knowing Obi-Wan would rescue him. As Ezra recovered and Obi-Wan explained to Ezra, Maul manipulated Ezra into seeking out Obi-Wan, trying to manipulate and accelerate events that were already in motion. He also further stated that Maul was an \"old wound\" that Obi-Wan himself must deal with, and not Ezra's responsibility. As Maul arrived, Obi-Wan faced down his old foe, whereupon Maul remarked and pondered as to why Obi-Wan would hide on such a planet. He then correctly deduced that Obi-Wan was protecting [[Luke Skywalker|someone]]. Obi-Wan, realizing Maul had to die to protect Luke, ignited his lightsaber then readied himself for one last confrontation. After a tense stare down, Maul then attacked, but Obi-Wan defeated the former Sith Lord in a few quick blows, severing his lightsaber and simultaneously slashing Maul across the chest. Shocked at being mortally wounded so quickly, Maul fell, only to be caught by Obi-Wan. He then asked if the person Obi-Wan was guarding was indeed the one who would destroy the Sith, to which Obi-Wan replied yes. Satisfied by this and finally having come to terms with his fate, with his last breath Maul stated that this \"chosen one\" would avenge him and Obi-Wan both. With this, Maul died, with Obi-Wan closing the fallen dark warrior's eyes out of respect for his old nemesis. The conflict between Kenobi and Maul was now over after thirty years.\n\n== Printed media ==\nHe appears in flashbacks during the novel ''[[Ahsoka]]'', it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex. During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield. However, before Maul can be taken into official custody, Order 66 is enacted and the clone troopers following Ahsoka turn on her, with the exception of Rex. With Rex's life in peril, Ahsoka abandons the chance of killing Maul, allowing the former Sith to escape once again.\n\nHe also stars in his own comic series published by [[Marvel Comics]], a 5-issue prequel series before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition|Disney Infinity 3.0]]''===\n[[File:Darth Maul Disney INFINITY.png|right|250px]]\nDarth Maul appears in ''Disney Infinity''<nowiki/>'s third installment both as a playable character and as a boss in the \"Twilight of the Republic\" playset.\n\nAfter Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Ahsoka are chased a drone, Maul arrives in Starship and begins a fight with Anakin. Later, Maul sent his Deathwatch henchmen to kill the three Jedi and Yoda on Tatooine. On Coruscant, Maul took hostage many Senators including [[Padme Amidala]] At that time the four jedi arrived and engaged a long fight with the Zabrak. Finally beaten, Maul attempts a final riposte against his enemies but is confronted with their powerful Force push. Maul is overwhelmed by their power, loses his Lightsaber and falls into the void and then disappears.\n\n==Disney Parks==\n===Star Wars Weekends===\nHe appears as a meetable character during [[Star Wars Weekends]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Relationshipslink}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to his current voice-actor, Sam Witwer, in an interview with IGN, Maul is far more unpredictable, cautious, and cunning than he was during the Clone Wars. Witwer describes him as \"fighting from the shadows\", and that they like to keep people guessing as to where he stands on the scale between evil and good.\n*Witwer also describes Maul as having several new facets to his personality, and that Maul \"changes the rules left and right\" as he goes along in order to survive.\n*As part of ''The Force Unleashed'' series of Easter Eggs on the ''Rebels'' animated series, Maul has some connections from that series:\n**His current voice actor, Sam Witwer is not only currently the voice of [[Emperor Palpatine]] in all recent ''Star Wars'' non-movie media, but also previously portrayed ''The Force Unleashed'' protagonist Starkiller/Galen Marek and his clones.\n**Maul did similar things to his opponents as Starkiller did, such as blinding their opponents, Kanan Jarrus and Rahm Kota respectively.\n**Maul's role being a Sith Master to Ezra is similar to Vader to Starkiller, except their respective apprentices' role on finding the master from the other side of force is opposite.\n*Maul's new lightsaber is double-bladed as his previous one was, but it is unknown how he obtained it; as it resembles an Inquisitor lightsaber, Maul probably took it from an Inquisitor he might have killed.\n*Prior to his death, Maul had made the most enemies, out of any Star Wars character.\n**He was also one of the longest surviving antagonists in the ''Star Wars'' Universe.\n*Maul is the only character in ''Star Wars'' who is a fallen Sith Lord.\n*Ironically, while Maul in his last moments believed Luke Skywalker would destroy the Sith and avenge him, the one who would end up doing so was none other than one of his replacements as [[palpatine|Darth Sidious]]' apprentice, [[Anakin Skywalker]], the boy that [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] protected from him years ago. However, Maul's belief can be interpreted as true, since it was Luke's love that destroyed the Darth Vader persona and allowed the Anakin persona to resurface.\n*In ''The Phantom Menace'', Maul only blinks once, when Obi-Wan slices him in half and sending him tumbling down the shaft to his presumed death.\n*Despite being the central antagonist of ''The Phantom Menace'', Maul only has about 6 minutes of screen time including his lightsaber battles and speaks two or three times.\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Maul|Maul}}\n*{{SW|url=databank/darth-maul|text=Darth Maul}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Sith]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Anthology characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
