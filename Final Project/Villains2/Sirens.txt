They appeared in a deleted scene where they are encountered by [[Ian Lightfoot]] and another deleted character, [[Jenny (Onward)|Jenny]]. They hypnotize the teens into staying in one of their homes which begins to sink along with them, but they can't escape due to being hypnotized. Fortunately, Ian's brother, [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]], comes to their rescue when he is revealed to be immune to the sirens singing and sings very off-key, which is a weakness for them and this also snaps Ian and Jenny out of their hypnosis.\n\nThey were soon cut, because the people behind ''Onward'' believed that a villain for the film was unnecessary.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSirens (Deleted Scene).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 2).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 3).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 4).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 5).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 6).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 7).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 8).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 9).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 10).png\nSirens (Deleted Scene 11).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Onward}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Onward characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Mermaids]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Unused concepts]]"
