She serves as one of the three secondary antagonists alongside [[Ora]] and [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]] as one of Makucha's followers.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nChuluun has been described as a cunning snow leopard. Using her natural abilities of a leopard, she can make other animals believe she is truly a ghost, and she sees this as self-amusement or as a defense mechanism.\n\nAfter her defeat by Bunga, she grows resentful of the [[Lion Guard]] and joins [[Makucha]] in his quest for vengeance.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nChuluun is a lean gray snow leopard with ice blue eyes, dark mauve nose, pale lavender fur with darker spots, and lighter underside. Her head features a diamond marking with two smaller markings on either side. Under her eyes are two streaks.\n\nHer shoulders show various markings, some diamond shaped with smaller markings inside. Her tail is tipped with grey-lavender fur with white just underneath.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===\"[[Ghost of the Mountain|'''Ghost of the Mountain''']]\"===\nWhen the elder of the red pandas [[Domog]] tells the Lion Guard to learn about the \"Ghost of the Mountain\" as the most fearsome monster the red pandas have ever feared to save the pack as the Lion Guard plans to stop the ghost the red pandas have talked about. Far away from the bamboo forest and surviving a couple of falling icicles, [[Anga]] spots the mysterious creature [[Kion]] cannot catch to which she explains that the creature she spotted was not a real ghost but an elusive cat to which [[Ono]] explains that the creature Anga spotted is a snow leopard, a cat whose fur helps blend in with the snow and camouflage within the environment. As the Lion Guard follows the snow leopard's footprints to which the snow leopard finally reveals and introduces herself as Chuluun. Kion urges her to stop pestering the red pandas in their bamboo forest to which she explains that she does not follow the Circle of Life but rather follow her own path as she tells the Guard that she has no animal to challenge her.\n\nSoon as Chuluun leaves, Anga spots her scaring the red pandas in the bamboo forest as the Lion Guard plans to stop her from terrorizing their habitat. As she retreats, Domog tells the other red pandas that [[Bunga]] is planning to stop Chuluun from attacking them as the red pandas and the Lion Guard plan to return to the Mountain where she lives. Bunga, along with the red pandas and the rest of the Lion Guard, arrives at the mountain where Chuluun is lurking as Bunga tells the red pandas to surround her while he takes on Chuluun himself. When Bunga uses his stench ability, Chuluun immediately falls off the ledge as the red pandas' cheer for Bunga's victory.\n\nMeanwhile after getting defeated by Bunga (although Domog thinks Chuluun is gone forever), she is revealed to have survived her encounter against Bunga and was approached by [[Makucha]] who asked her to [[Makucha's Army|join him]]. She then accepts happily to join him and take revenge on the Lion Guard.\n\n===\"[[Dragon Island|'''Dragon Island''']]\"===\nChuluun briefly appears with a non-speaking role at the end of the episode with Makucha when they meet [[Ora]].

Arriving back again, Chuluun and the other two members of Makucha's Army prepare an ambush by taking revenge on the Night Pride. Fortunately, the Lion Guard and Night Pride were able to defeat them, while Nirmala tells Kion that the venom on [[Baliyo]] will wear off eventually.\n\nUpon defeat, Chuluun, along with the rest of Makucha's Army, is upset about their encounter with the Night Pride as [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]] joins the army to take revenge against the Guard especially Bunga.\n\n===\"[[Little Old Ginterbong|'''Little Old Ginterbong''']]\"===\nWhile discussing to get into the Tree of Life without being rejected, Chuluun, Makucha, and Ora meet Mama Binturong who has become another member of Makucha's army in a plan to take out the Lion Guard and the Night Pride.
