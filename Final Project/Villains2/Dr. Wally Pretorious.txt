He then kidnapped the town residents and made humanoid replicas of them, after he made a satellite that jammed their frequencies forcing their vehicle to break down and prevented them from using their comlinks. He was about to extract their DNA until [[Nosedive Flashblade|Nosedive]] saved them.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* The name Pretorius might be an allusion to Dr. Septimus Pretorius, the main-antagonist of the film ''The Bride of Frankenstein'' ([[1935]]).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMechanic_disguise.png|Dr. Wally Pretorious as Pops the mechanic\nHf.png\nHf2.png\nHf3.png\nHf4.png|Dr. Wally Pretorious' defeat\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pretorious, Wally}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
