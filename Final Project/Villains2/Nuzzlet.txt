[[Kick Buttowski (character)|Kick]] had to do research on it for a school report. It only appeared in the episode \"[[Shh!]]\".\n\n==History==\nThe Nuzzlet is about the size of a gerbil or a hamster. Other than its physical appearance, very little is known about it (other than the fact that it should never be fed any candy).\n\nWhen Kick feeds it a piece of candy, he finds out too late that he shouldn't have done so. When he goes to retrieve it, he discovers it has turned feral. Its teeth and claws have sharpened and its eyes have turned red. From there, things only get worse when the Nuzzlet starts causing mischief. It bites when Kick gets his finger near it. It can now lift and move objects many times its size, and easily tosses Kick around like a rag doll. After an array of making trouble for Kick, the Nuzzlet gobbles down an entire jarful of candy. With a full belly, it suddenly becomes unstable and explodes, devastating the library.\n\nAfter it lets out a belch, the Nuzzlet is back to normal. Kick stealthily retrieves the Nuzzlet and sneaks back to class. He tells about how violent and destructive it was and that no one had ever survived researching it. Ms. Fitzpatrick, unaware of its effects, gives the Nuzzlet more candy, causing it to blow the roof off the school.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nNuzzlet about to be booked in.jpg\nNuzzlet against shelves.jpg\nNuzzlet huh.jpg\nCute Nuzzlet.jpg\nEat Candy Nuzzlet.jpg\nAngry Nuzzlet.jpg\nNuzzlet body slam.jpg\nNuzzlet another body slam.jpg\nNuzzlet body spin.jpg\nNuzzlet finger bite.jpg\nNaughty Nuzzlet.jpg\nNuzzlet book throw.jpg\nNuzzlet with scissors.jpg\nNuzzlet bye-bye.jpg\nSnicker Nuzzlet.jpg\nNuzzlet raspberry.jpg\nNuzzlet push librarian.jpg\nNuzzlet try to grab.jpg\nNuzzlet in the mouth.jpg\nLaughing Nuzzlet.jpg\nMischevious Nuzzlet.jpg\nNuzzlet catches candy.jpg\nFeral Nuzzlet.jpg\nFull Nuzzlet.jpg\nNuzzlet Belch.jpg\nNuzzlet back to normal.jpg\nNuzzlet smile.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
