My loser detector.|Scott uses his \"loser detector\" on Jess Aarons}}'''Scott Hoager''' is the third antagonist and a classmate of [[Jess Aarons]] and [[Leslie Burke]] specifically created for the [[2007]] film adaptation of\u00a0''[[Bridge to Terabithia]]''. He often bullies Jess at school along with his sidekick,\u00a0[[Gary Fulcher]].\n\n== Role in the film ==\nScott sits behind\u00a0Jess in\u00a0[[Ms. Myers]]' class and teases him behind his back. During the first day of school, he tilts to Jess and uses his \"loser detector\" on him. When Ms. Myers rebukes them, Scott blames Jess for hitting him, but she, luckily, doesn't believe him. As Ms. Myers continues talking to the rest of the class, Scott taunts Jess for wearing pink shoes belonging to his older sister, Ellie.\n\nDuring recess, Scott and Gary participate in the race. At the scratch-line, Gary stands on Jess' left side while Scott is on his right. When\u00a0Leslie Burke\u00a0wants to join in, Scott tells her it is only for boys, but Jess upholds her (by asking Scott, if he's afraid of losing to a girl) who is then allowed to run. She eventually wins.\n\nScott soon starts make fun of Leslie, too. He laughs loudly when she mistakenly drops her bag, causing all her things to fall out. He also taunts her because her parents, Bill and Judy, don't have a TV at home. Since she and Jess become friends, Scott and Gary decide to wait for them in front of the school, but have no chance to bully them, as they enter alongside their music teacher, [[Miss Edmunds]].\n\nAfter Leslie's death, Scott\u00a0and\u00a0Gary bully Jess even worse.\u00a0In class, Scott taunts him about it by jokingly calling him\u00a0the fastest kid in the class now, leading him to turn and punch Scott in the face, making him surprised. He later appears with Gary where the latter pushes Jess to the floor, implying that they haven't shifted their attitudes since Scott got punched by Jess, while a sympathetic\u00a0[[Janice Avery]]\u00a0watches. He isn't seen again for the rest of the film afterward.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-605.jpg|Scott taunts Jess in class while Gary watches.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-663.jpg|Scott taunts Jess for wearing his sister Ellie's hand-me-down sneakers.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8391.jpg|\"So looks like you're the fastest kid in the class now, huh?\"\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8394.jpg|Scott realizes his joke has gone too far.\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8395.jpg|\"It's a joke, dude.\"\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8398.jpg|Scott, before Jess punches him for mocking Leslie's death\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8401.jpg|Scott, after Jess punches him\nbridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-8407.jpg|''\"Are you nuts?!\"''\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n[[File:Bridge-to-terabithia-disneyscreencaps.com-6699.jpg|thumb|220px|Scott's Terabithian counterpart, the Squogre]]\n* One of the creatures Jess and Leslie fight in Terabithia, the Squogre, a half-squirrel, half ogre creature, is based on Scott. It also make the beeping sound of his \"loser detector\".\n* Also, when Jess and Leslie are fighting a group of Squogres in Terabithia, Jess grows a metal fist and punches several pf them. This foreshadows a scene in the film when he punches Scott for making a snide remark about Leslie's death.\n* Scott does not appear in the book because he was created especially for the film.\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bridge to Terabithia characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
