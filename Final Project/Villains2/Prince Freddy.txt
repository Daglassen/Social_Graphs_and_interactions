He hires [[Pete|Sir Pete]] to help him in his plot to keep [[Goofy|Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees]] from returning the throne to the king.\n\n===Personality===\nPrince Freddy is a complainer. He also is egocentric and dictatorial, only thinking of himself and wanting to rule Halfbakedham, even though his cousin is the rightful leader.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nPrince Freddy is a short, averagely built anthropomorphic dog with brown hair. He wears a purple and velvet robe bordered with ermine, a gray undershirt, red slippers, and a large crown.\n\n===Role in the series===\nHe only appears in the Goof History episode \"[[Goofin' Hood and his Melancholy Men]]\". He is the antagonist of the episode, as he took over the throne from his cousin, [[Mayor Baba|King Richard the Chicken-Hearted]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Prince Freddy's personality is similar to the Chief Inspector's from the episode \"[[Inspector Goofy]]\". This may be due to the fact that Frank Welker provided both of their voices, basing them off of comedian Joe Besser.\n*Prince Freddy's character is a parody of [[Prince John]] from [[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]].\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
