Kapson is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Kapson is an elderly Zora and a pious priest of Hylia. Similar to other elder Zora, Kapson will express anger towards Link for the death of Mipha during the Great Calamity. However, he claims to hate Link's actions, not Link himself, and believes that Link can be forgiven. He claims to be bored by his life in retirement, since he isn't doing anything but idling around. He asks Link to introduce him to any engaged couples, as he would like to officiate one more wedding.
In the "From the Ground Up" Side Quest, Link recruits Kapson to officiate Hudson and Rhondson's wedding in Tarrey Town. After the wedding, he takes up residence in Tarrey Town's Inn as its innkeeper. Kapson's inn does not charge any Rupees for a stay and does not offer any superior bedding options. If Link speaks to Kapson while atop any of the furniture in his Inn, he will pray to Hylia that she smites him for his insolence.
