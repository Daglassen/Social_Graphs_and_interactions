Grim Reaper is a tech villiain and enemy to [[the Avengers]].\n\n==Biography==\n===[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]===\n\nLittle is known about the early life of Eric Williams. He is brothers with [[Wonder Man|Simon Williams]], who went on to start a technology company.\n\nAt some point his right arm had an implant that gave him a large metal scythe. He went to work for HYDRA and became of their top agents.\n\nIn order to break out his leader, Baron Strucker, Eric disguised himself as a low-level HYDRA soldier as they attacked the United Nations. They were defeated by [[Iron Man]] and arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. They were taken to the Vault where Eric attacked the guards. He freed Strucker and nearly escaped. However, he was taken down by [[Nick Fury]] and [[Maria Hill]] and captured.\n\nLater, the Vault experienced a massive power outage releasing all of the inmates. Eric escaped with Strucker and both returned to HYDRA.\n\nThe two were at a HYDRA meeting when [[Baron Zemo]] appeared wanting help since [[Captain America]] had returned. They refused and Zemo set out to defeat the World War II hero himself.\n\nWhen Tony Stark bought out his brother's company, Eric went to Simon to help. Simon wanted revenge so he took him to [[MODOK]] of [[A.I.M.]]. MODOK turned Simon into living energy and he took on the name Wonder Man. However, Simon was defeated by the [[Avengers]].\n\nGrim Reaper went with other HYDRA soldiers to Wakanda with [[Ulysses Klaw|Klaw]] to steal some Vibranium. Wakandan king Man-Ape threatened to kill him if HYDRA betrayed him. He fought with [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] when [[Black Panther|T'Challa]] brought the Avengers to the country to reclaim his family's throne. Grim Reaper accidentally knocked Klaw off a platform where he was then transformed into a being made of sound. Grim Reaper and HYDRA escaped with some vibranium.\n\nHYDRA tried to make a deal with A.I.M. to make a powerful cube. During the dealing, Hawkeye interrupted and took down several of the A.I.M. and HYRDA soldiers with Reaper successfully escaping. When Hawkeye and [[Mockingbird]] came in to fight him and his HYDRA soldiers with Captain America and Black Panther in tow, Grim Reaper then had Hawkeye and Mockingbird captured and brought to Strucker. After the two broke out, he took part in fighting them until Captain America and T'Challa dropped in through the skylight in Hydra Island. Reaper then started fighting Panther until the latter used his claws to slice the former's scythe into pieces. He and [[Viper]] were later arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D]].\n\n===[[Avengers Assemble]]===\nGrim Reaper fought alongside [[Crossbones]] against Cap and Iron Man and then appeared to take Iron Man prisoner. They were then followed by Captain America, who then took out the two villains with Iron Man and took their costumes to go undercover with [[MODOK]], [[Red Skull]], and their cabal. Reaper and Crossbones were then apparently beaten by [[Thor Odinson]] and [[Hulk]] for answers.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nGrim Reaper.png\nReal Reaper and Crossbones.png\nAemh ss04.jpg\nZemowithStrucker-AEMH.png\n2012-05-21 2103.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* This version of Grim Reaper has a hood, similar to the mythological personification of Death, rather than the helmet seen in the comics.\n\n{{MAUWiki|Grim_Reaper_(Yost_Universe)}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:HYDRA agents]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
