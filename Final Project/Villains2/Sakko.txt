He fails Skeleton King and is taken away by a strange jack in the box looking robot with legs, but he appears in later episodes and with an eyepatch. He makes a brief cameo in the final episode with Krinkle, drawing a picture of the Skeleton King holding him. Sakko seems to be a Marmoset. He talks with a Russian accent. He seems to be nearly a friend, or an acquaintance to [[Mandarin]], and he appears to like him. He is voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. He is sometimes seen with Mandarin. </span>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Some viewers believe that the Alchemist created him and that he was a monkey prototype. This hasn't been confirmed.\n*He is female instead of male in some foreign dubs.\n\n{{Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!}}\n[[Category:Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
