Maike is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Maike is a Gerudo merchant in the Kara Kara Bazaar who sells Materials and Food. If Link speaks to Maike during the day, she will attempt to say "good morning" in Hylian and explains that they say sav'otta in Gerudo. If Link speaks to her at night, she will try to say "good evening" in Hylian and explains that they say sav'sabba there. She also incorrectly says "welcome" in Hylian as "well come" and explains that they say vasaaq in Gerudo. Maike's little sister, Estan, runs a butcher shop in Gerudo Town. Maike tells Link that Estan knows the Hylian Language well, recommending that he stop by and meet her. However, Maike quickly realizes that as a man, Link would not be allowed to enter Gerudo Town and meet her.
If Link speaks to Maike while searching for the man who discovered a way into Gerudo Town, he may ask her if she has seen a suspicious male merchant. Maike will be unable to recall someone of that description, suggesting that Link asks one of the Hylian merchants at the Bazaar instead.
If Link walks near her wearing the Gerudo Set she will remark that the outfit suits him.
