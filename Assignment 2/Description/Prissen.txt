Hang on!|Domidak|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Hey, buddy! What's your problem? You aren't being incredibly rude and listening to our conversation, are you?|Domidak|BotW}}</ref> but {{Term|BotW|Prissen}} can't help boasting about how close they are to finding their latest target.<ref>{{Cite|We're treasure hunters, on the trail of our latest score... The {{Color|BotW Red| treasure of the great bandit Misko}}! It's as good as ours!|Prissen|BotW}}</ref> His brother immediately chastises him and {{Term|BotW|Prissen}} apologizes for his overzealousness.<ref>{{Cite|Sorry, Dak... I got carried away.|Prissen|BotW}}</ref> \n\n{{Term|BotW|Domidak}} will try to throw {{Term|BotW|Link}} off by saying {{Term|BotW|Prissen}} is rambling to keep him off track of the treasure,<ref name=\"Brother\"/> but if {{Term|BotW|Link}} is persistent, {{Term|BotW|Prissen}} will recommend they just tell {{Term|BotW|Link}} their information to get him to go away.<ref name=\"Riddle\">{{Cite|Hey, Dak... Why don't we just tell him? Maybe he'll leave us alone if we do.
