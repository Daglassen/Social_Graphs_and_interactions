A disgrace to the forces of evil.|Maleficent on her goons|Sleeping Beauty}}\nThe '''Goons''' are a simple-minded race that serve as [[Maleficent]]'s henchmen and the tertiary antagonists in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1959]] animated feature film, ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''===\nThe Goons are instructed to find [[Aurora|Princess Aurora]] over the next sixteen years, but due to their stupidity, they end up looking for a baby the whole time. Maleficent learns this sixteen years after the beginning of the search. Enraged at their incompetence, Maleficent, after briefly entering hysteria over the stupidity, then brutally attacks them with dark magic. Later on, they, under Maleficent's orders, lay in wait for [[Prince Phillip]], deducing he was the only one capable of lifting her curse. As soon as he arrived to visit Aurora (or as he knew her to be, Briar Rose), they then ambushed, beat him down, and tied him up before being ordered by Maleficent to depart with them after briefly taunting him. They take him to the Forbidden Mountains to hold him captive so that he would not be able to awaken Aurora from her sleep. As Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather arrive and free Phillip, [[Diablo]] and the Goons attempt to stop them in their tracks. However, due to the fairies' magic, their weapons were transformed into harmless entities. It is unknown what happened to them after Maleficent's death and Princess Aurora's awakening from the spell.\n\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nThe Goons are seen crossing past [[Eddie Valiant]] in the Maroon Cartoon studio lot in the beginning scene of the film. Another one can also be glimpsed in the crowd of Toons during the second-to-last shot of the film's finale.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Goons were cameo characters in the show, mostly appearing in crowd scenes. Their most notable appearance is in the episode \"[[Halloween With Hades|Halloween with Hades]]\", where [[Hades]] sees them being scolded by Maleficent, who strikes them with her staff, sending them back to the castle. They are also present in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.\n\n==Video games==\n===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===\nMaleficent's goons make an appearance in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]''. While [[Ventus]] and [[Aqua]] explore the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Enchanted Dominion|Enchanted Dominion]], they are seen to guard their mistress's castle with their lives. They are first seen in Ventus's scenario when he rushes at them when they guard the hall housing Aurora's, captive heart. When Aqua is helping Prince Phillip escape, hundreds of goons came to stop them, but none were successful.\n\nAfter the events of the game, they are never seen again in other games of the continuity. This is largely because Maleficent learned to summon and control the much more powerful [[Heartless]], and thus favored them instead of her previous servants, leaving them to their own endeavors in the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Enchanted Dominion|Enchanted Dominion]].\n\n===[[Epic Mickey (series)|''Epic Mickey'' series]]===\nIn ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'', [[Mizrabel]] uses Illusion versions of the Goons in her army of minions.\n\n==Printed media==\n===''Paperin Furioso''===\nIn this Italian [[Donald Duck]] story, [[Hazel the Witch|Hazel]] punishes Donald for being lazy by sending him back in a time of 1500 years. In the past, he encounters the evil wizard [[Basilisco]], who apparently uses the Goons as henchmen. As Basilisco is at the end of the story defeated, and the story seems to take place earlier than the motion picture, it remains possible that after their former master's demise, they were eventually recruited by [[Maleficent]] as minions.\n\n===''Santa's Christmas Crisis''===\nIn this 1970 Christmas comic-strip serial, one of the goons (one with stringy black hair, a pig snout, and no tusk) discovers the Christmas spirit and, realizing the error of his ways, decides to leave Maleficent's service. Knowing that the inhabitants of Sleeping Beauty's kingdom would fear him, he instead seeks out [[Santa Claus]] and offers to become ''his'' minion (as being a henchman is all he's good at). Santa has him guard his reindeer, which comes in handy when [[Maleficent]] sends [[Diablo]] to deliver them poisoned food to ruin Christmas \u2014 a trick that fails thanks to the Goon immediately recognizing Diablo.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:The Goons in One Man's Dream.jpg|thumb|250px|The Goons with Maleficent in One Man's Dream.]]\n===[[Disneyland]]===\nGoons can be seen within the [[Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough]], with a hallway on the uppermost level having them lurk behind a set of doors and occasionally jumping into view. In the original 1955 installation, guests could peek into the doors to see them staring back by way of small mirrors reflecting a guest's eyes. However, the popularity of this gag caused traffic issues and they were covered up for decades with the figures being rediscovered during the creation of the 2008 reimagining.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nAt the [[Magic Kingdom]], the Goons are enemies in the game [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]. Here, Maleficent is revived from the dead by [[Hades]] and rallies together her minions to stop the park guests from foiling her plans. The pig-like Goon battles the guests at the start of the mission but is soon defeated.\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nIn [[Tokyo Disneyland]], the Goons are featured during the villains' segment of [[One Man's Dream II: The Magic Lives On!]]. Goons were also featured in the former [[Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour]] attraction.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''Sleeping Beauty'', they were voiced by the late [[Candy Candido]], the late [[Pinto Colvig]], and the late [[Bob Amsberry]] (who died in a tragic car accident in [[1957]], making this film his final film role and released two years after his death).\n*On [[INDUCKS]], their appearance in ''Paperin Furioso'' is strangely missed with an appearance of the Evil Dwarfs from ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' comics.\n*During the scene where the goons ambush [[Prince Phillip]] at [[Aurora's Cottage|Aurora's cottage]], some of the goons make the exact same gibberish sounds as the ants from the [[Donald Duck]] cartoons \"[[Tea for Two Hundred]]\" and \"[[Uncle Donald's Ants]]\", which are reused audio from both cartoons. Co-incidentally, the ants were also voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]], much like those goons themselves.\n\n{{Sleeping Beauty}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{Epic Mickey}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:Archers]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Reptiles]]\n[[Category:Sleeping Beauty characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts Bosses]]\n[[Category:Trolls]]\n[[Category:Goblins]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
