They were led by [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] until he was killed by his apprentice, [[Kylo Ren]], who assumed leadership.\n\nThe organization is one of the main factions of the ''[[Star Wars sequel trilogy|Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]]. They fight against the New Republic militia known as the [[Resistance]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ManaByte/status/588787603656192000/photo/1 Jeremy Conrad (@ManaByte) - Twitter]</ref> The First Order continues the Imperial tradition of using [[First Order Stormtroopers|stormtroopers]] as their foot soldiers.<ref>[http://www.starwars7news.com/2015/04/closer-look-at-the-force-awakens-flametrooper-snowtrooper-and-more.html ''Closer Look at The Force Awakens Flametrooper, Snowtrooper and More!'' - Star Wars 7 News]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe First Order was a successor of the Galactic Empire, created when the Empire fell with the deaths of [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] and [[Darth Vader]]. After a year of fighting, the fracturing Empire made its last stand above the planet Jakku, where it lost to the [[New Republic]] in a battle that caused high casualties on both sides. Severely defeated, the New Republic forced the Empire to disarm and sign a treaty called the Galactic Concordance, in which the Empire was incredibly limited in its ability to wage war.\n\nIn the aftermath, those Imperial forces that did not and refused to comply with the New Republic's demands retreated to the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, where they would rebuild. Over time, and to help rebuild their power, they entered into deals with corrupt politicians, tradesmen and gangs of outlaws and criminals. As the fragment that would become the First Order was small, it began work into creating soldiers, weapons, armor and warships that were technologically superior to the Empire to give them an edge. This edge was furthered when [[Supreme Leader Snoke]], a powerful practitioner in the dark side of the Force, took the reigns as the organization's Supreme Leader. Among the advancements that emerged were several new types of starship, such as the ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer, more powerful armor and weapons, and Starkiller Base. The stormtroopers of the First Order, being fewer in number, were also better trained and better equipped than their Imperial predecessors; they were far more proficient than previous varieties of stormtroopers. They were conditioned since birth into serving the First Order willingly, and were indoctrinated to think that the New Republic had created lawlessness throughout the galaxy, with their leaders stating that only the First Order could restore justice to the galaxy, often using pre-recorded speeches to turn its citizens against the New Republic's \"tyranny\".\n\nAs the ranks of First Order grew, it became more and more bold, and began pushing into New Republic territory. As the New Republic did not wish to instigate another war, it was only able to formally protest against the First Order's violations against the treaties signed at the end of the Galactic Civil War. The expansion of its ranks was alarming, particularly to The Resistance, which privately fought against the First Order, and reconnaissance on their part was shocking in revealing the First Order's strength and numbers.\n\nThe First Order's military was comprised of stormtroopers, just as the Galactic Empire's was. However, First Order stormtroopers were far more skilled and better equipped than Imperial stormtroopers and were therefore a much greater threat, despite being fewer in number. Several classes of stormtrooper existed. Among these were snowtroopers, heavy assault troopers, flametroopers utilizing powerful flame-throwers, and riot-control troopers, which specialized in melee combat and wielded powerful batons capable of even combating lightsabers. The First Order also deployed such vehicles as walkers not dissimilar to the Empire's AT-AT's and AT-ST's (though little is known about them). The First Order Navy was predominantly comprised of Star Destroyers, including older, Imperial models and new, massive capital ships such as Kylo Ren's flagship, the ''Finalizer''. Despite the ''Finalizer''<nowiki/>'s size (twice the size of an average Star Destroyer), The Resistance believed that even bigger ships existed in the organization's ranks.\n\nThe military itself was led by the generals of the First Order. The [[Knights of Ren]], a group of dark side Force users led by his apprentice, Kylo Ren, were also part of the ranks as allies of the order. Those branches answered directly to Snoke, though they competed against one another, likely because both the agendas of the knights and Kylo Ren trumped that of the generals. Tensions were made higher by the fact that the Knights of Ren were not part of the First Order's formal hierarchy and operated freely and of their own volition under Snoke's orders. In addition to these, an organization of [[Praetorian Guard]]s served as the Supreme Leader's bodyguards, and protected him against all threats. Armed with various melee weapons as well as lightsaber-resistant and blaster-proof armor, they made up a formidable force that surpassed the normal stormtroopers in ferocity, skill and power.\n\nThe First Order also had no planet serving as its true capital, as their Supreme Leader's true base, the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]'', was mobile, but [[Starkiller Base]] served as an unofficial headquarters for the organization, particularly during its attack on the Hosnian system and the attempted attack on the planet [[D'Qar]], the site of the Resistance's headquarters. When the superweapon was destroyed by the [[Resistance]], Supreme Leader Snoke merely ordered General Hux to leave and bring Kylo Ren to him for further training after his apprentice had killed his own father, Han Solo. Snoke also had his soldiers regroup so as to fight another day. Snoke's true base, the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''Supremacy'', was a truly terrifying vessel, far larger and more powerful than even the [[Super Star Destroyer|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnoughts]] of the Galactic Empire.\n\n==History==\nSometime after the Battle of [[Jakku]], the First Order was founded by [[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]] from the remnants of the [[Galactic Empire]], three decades after the Battle of Endor, the First Order would largely escape galactic attention, with many in the Galactic Senate believing that it posed no real threat to the galaxy at large, with Chancellor Lanever Villecham arguing there was no need for concern as long as it adhered to the dictates of the Galactic Concordance. Despite this, the First Order blatantly defied the accords by ushering in the mass mobilization of superior stormtrooper forces, along with violating Republic bans on the sale of weaponry to the First Order and its rules governing capital ships. Testing the resolve of the [[New Republic]], small skirmishes would occasionally erupt between the First Order and the Republic, all while the Starkiller operation would seek a suitable planet for implementation.\n\nApproximately thirty years later, the First Order destroy the New Republic's current capital on [[Hosnian Prime]], seeking to end its unofficial support of the Resistance with a new superweapon known as [[Starkiller Base]], which could fire a planet-shattering beam through hyperspace, and destroy an entire star system. With the destruction of the Republic's capital and a portion of its fleet, the First Order stood poised to destroy both the New Republic and the Resistance.\n\nMuch to its chagrin, former deserter [[Finn]] - along with [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] would arrive at Starkiller Base in an attempt to disable its shields and allow the Resistance fleet to destroy the planet-converted superweapon. With the First Order fifteen minutes away from destroying the Resistance's base on [[D'Qar]], the trio would not only manage to shut down Starkiller's shields, but also rescue [[Rey]] after a lightsaber duel with [[Kylo Ren]]. Escaping the planet with seconds to spare, the First Order's sun-harvesting superweapon would be destroyed by the Resistance's Starfighter Corps, forming a new star where the planet once was. Despite this major setback, the First Order's resolve towards galactic conquest only increased, with Snoke deciding to finish Kylo's training and regroup after the destruction of the superweapon.\n\nThe First Order was quick to mobilize upon the destruction of their superweapon, and began hammering the Resistance with fast and heavy attacks, assaulting them at their base on D'Qar. Though quick thinking by [[Poe Dameron]] and a barely successful bombing run managed to save the Resistance's main leadership, only three capital ships managed to escape into hyperspace. Even then, General Hux was successfully able to track the Resistance through hyperspace. At the same time, Supreme Leader Snoke, emboldened by his impending victory, appeared with his flagship, the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''Supremacy''. Unable to escape, the Resistance was forced to maximize the power of their shields while remaining at the edge of cannon range. At the same time, the Resistance flagship, MC85 Star Cruiser ''Raddus'' was attacked by Kylo Ren, which wiped out all the Resistance High Command, save his mother, [[Leia Organa]].\n\nThough Finn, BB-8 and technician Rose tried to sneak aboard the ''Supremacy'' to disable the hyperspace tracking systems, they were ultimately caught by First Order [[Captain Phasma]]. Simultaneously, Jedi aspirant Rey boarded the ''Supremacy'' and turned herself over to Kylo Ren in an attempt to sway him back to the side of the Resistance. While Interrogated by Snoke, she was forced to watch as the First Order attacked her helpless allies. Snoke then ordered Kylo Ren to kill her. But Ren, hurt and betrayed by Snoke after being berated for his failures on Starkiller Base and moved by the feelings he developed for Rey, stealthily betrayed his master, killing him with the Skywalker's lightsaber. Kylo then aligned with Rey to defeat Snoke's Praetorian Guards.\n\nAfter the guards were defeated, Kylo offered Rey a place at his side to rule the galaxy together, but Rey refused and fought him over the Skywalker lightsaber. Their battle resulted in a draw, which knocked them both, but Rey woke up first, allowing her to escape. Finn, BB-8 and Rose simultaneously escaped after defeating Phasma while Resistance Vice Admiral Holdo jumped into hyperspace while piloting the abandoned ''Raddus'' to cut the Mega-Destroyer in half and destroy twenty other ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers. This allowed the survivors to regroup on the planet of Crait. With Snoke dead, Kylo Ren quickly assumed the title of Supreme Leader and Force choked Hux into compliance when his rival protested.\n\nOn Crait, the Resistance fought to buy time for their remaining leadership to escape. As they battled the First Order [[AT-M6|AT-M6s]] and [[First Order AT-AT|AT-AT]]s and the superlaser siege cannon the regime had deployed, Rey used her Force powers to create a way out and get the few remaining members to safety. Simultaneously, to the shock of everyone present, Luke Skywalker appeared to face Kylo Ren. However, after a short duel, Luke revealed to Ren that he was merely an illusion, seeking to distract Ren long enough to allow his comrades to escape. After watching Luke fade away, Kylo Ren entered the base, finding it empty and his plans thwarted.\n\nOne year later, the revived Emperor Palpatine announced his return along with the Sith to the galaxy. Kylo searched the Emperor with the intent to kill him, not wanting any threat to his position as the Supreme Leader. He found Palpatine hiding with his [[Sith Eternal]] at the planet [[Exegol]]. The Emperor offered Kylo the Throne of the Sith and the command of the Final Order, a massive fleet of ''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers, if the dark warrior killed the last Jedi, Rey, who he reveals that is his granddaughter.\n\nNot wanting to follow the Emperor's plans, Kylo prentends to accept the offer and starts to pursue Rey with his knights, wanting to find and convince her to join him to kill Palpatine and take his throne for themselves. Upon finding and revealing all the truth to Rey, she still refuses his offer and escapes. Eventually, the two meet at the ruins of the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]], which results in Kylo Ren's return to the light side after he senses his mother's death and Rey saving him by healing a mortal wound that she inflicted on him. Shortly after going to [[Ahch-To]], Rey decides to confront her grandfather transmits tracking signals for the Resistance members to follow her to Exegol. Determined to help Rey, the former dark warrior and Supreme Leader, Ben Solo, finds an old TIE scout in the wreckage of the Death Star and follows her tracking signals.\n\nDuring the Battle of Exegol, [[Allegiant General Pryde]] had the source of a navigation signal that the Sith fleet needed to deploy off world switched from a navigation tower on Exegol to a beacon on his command ship. However, a Resistance landing team made landing on the ''Steadfast'' and turned its own turbolasers against it, destroying the Resurgent Star Destroyer, and with it, the navigation signal, preventing the remaining Sith Star Destroyers from deploying off of Exegol and reinforcing the First Order. Finn and Jannah narrowly escaped aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' with the help of Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca as the ''Steadfast'' exploded and plunged to Exegol's surface.\n\nThe Resistance's victory at Exegol inspired the inhabitants of the galaxy to rise up against the First Order, causing their military rule across the galaxy to crumble, including on Bespin, Endor, Jakku, Coruscant, Naboo, Corellia, Lothal, and Thyferra. The First Order fell across the galaxy, and was ultimately defeated in the war.\n\n==Notable Members==\n*[[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]] \u2020\n*[[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]] \u2020\n*[[Kylo Ren]] \u2020 (formerly)\n*[[Allegiant General Pryde|Enric Pryde]] \u2020\n*[[General Hux|Armitage Hux]] \u2020\n*[[Captain Phasma|Phasma]] \u2020\n*[[BB-9E]]\n*[[Tierny]] \u2020\n*[[Pyre]] \u2020\n*[[Elrik Vonreg]] \u2020\n*Dopheld Mitaka\n*Poldin LeHuse \u2020\n*FN-2003 \u2020\n*FN-2199 \u2020\n*FN-2000\n*FN-3181\n*[[Finn|FN-2187]] (formerly)\n*[[Jannah|TZ-1719]] (formerly)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nFirst Order Banner.jpg\nThe Force Awakens EW 06.jpg|[[Kylo Ren]] with a squad of stormtroopers.\nThe Force Awakens EW 07.jpg|[[General Hux]].\nStar Wars The Last Jedi - Promotional Image 5.jpg\nThe First Order and Kylo.jpg\nSW Encyclopedia 2015 02.jpg \nStar-wars-art-of-the-force-awakens-stormtrooper-concept.jpg|Costume design for the [[First Order Stormtroopers]].\nKyloRenStormtroopers.jpg|Concept art of Kylo Ren watching the stormtroopers burning down a [[Jakku]] village.\nKylo and First Order Mustafar concept art.jpg|Concept art of the First Order at [[Mustafar]].\nFirstOrderSnowtrooperFathead.png|First Order Snowtrooper.\nFlametrooperFathead.png|First Order Flametrooper.\nFirstOrderStormtrooperFathead.png|First Order Heavy Stormtrooper.\nFirstOrderStormtrooperFathead2.png|First Order Stormtrooper.\nFirstOrderStormtrooperFathead3.png|First Order Stormtrooper Officer.\nFirstOrderStarDestroyer-Fathead.png|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer.\nFirst Order TIE fighter.png|First Order TIE Fighter.\nFirstOrderTieFigher-Fathead.png|First Order Special Forces TIE Fighter.\nFirst-order-interrogator-droid.jpeg|IT-000 Interrogator Droid.\nTIE_whisper_starfighter.png|TIE Whisper Fighter.\nThe Force Awakens 1.png|A squad of First Order Stormtroopers.\nFirst Order Transporter.jpeg|First Order Transporter.\nThe-Force-Awakens-19.png|Kylo Ren freezing a blasterbolt fired by [[Poe Dameron]] during the assault on the Jakku village.\nThe-Force-Awakens-26.png|The ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer ''Finalizer'' allows Kylo Ren's shuttle to land.\nThe-Force-Awakens-33.png|A special forces member of the First Order.\nThe-Force-Awakens-20.png|Stormtroopers watch as Starkiller Base fires upon the New Republic.\nThe Force Awakens Korean Spot.png|General Hux, [[Captain Phasma]] and other First Order officials over look their army of stormtroopers on Starkiller Base.\nThe-Force-Awakens-27.png|Captain Phasma, the field commander of the First Order military.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|First Order}}\n*{{SW|url=/databank/the-first-order|text=The First Order}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Sequel Trilogy]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Resistance]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
