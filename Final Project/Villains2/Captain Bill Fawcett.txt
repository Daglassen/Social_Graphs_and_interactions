He sends Shane to the Plummer residence in Bethesda, [[Maryland]], to search for the secret project called GHOST and look after their children.\n\nUnfortunately, Julie can't retrieve the box unless she figures out the password Howard used and she and Bill end up staying longer than expected. After several weeks, she finally figures it out (\"my angel\"), retrieved a key from a box, and is on her way home. Meanwhile, Shane calls Bill and says that he found the GHOST in a secret vault underneath the garage.\n\nWhen Bill and Julie arrive home, the former and Shane go to the garage, where the latter says he is rethinking his career. Two ninjas arrive armed and pulled off their masks, revealing themselves as the Plummers' North Korean neighbors, [[Mr. & Mrs. Chun]]. Bill suddenly knocks Shane out, revealing himself to be a double agent.\n\nMr. Chun restrains and guard the children while Bill and Mrs. Chun take Julie down to the vault. They open the door but a dangerous security system prevents them from going further. Shane was awakened by the children who escape and heads down to the vault.\n\nIn the vault, Bill threatens Julie saying if she doesn't open it he'll shoot her. Shane interrupts saying that she doesn't know how to activate it. Bill then forces him to open it. He gets past the security system using a dance Howard had used to make his son, [[Peter Plummer|Peter]], go to sleep each night. Bill, Julie, and Mrs. Chun walk to the vault slowly. Bill then points his gun at Shane telling him to open it. But he changes his mind, points his gun at Mrs. Chun, and tells her to open it instead since he walked the floor first. Shane quickly grabs Julie back and fights Bill and Mrs. Chun. Julie knocks Mrs. Chun out and Bill asks Shane if he has any last words before he shoots him. He says \"Say goodnight, Peter Panda,\" which activates the vault, knocking Bill out with its door. He and the Chuns are then arrested for their crimes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nxpacif38.jpg|Shane telling Bill that he found the vault\ngpacif39.jpg|Julie returns home with Bill.\n600px-PacifierUSP-45-2.jpg|Bill holds Julie hostage.\nCaptainbillfawcett.jpg|\"Any last words, Shane?\"\nWatch The Pacifier (2005) Online for Free - Viooz.jpg|Bill and the Chuns get arrested.\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fawcett, Bill}}\n\n{{The Pacifier}}\n[[Category:The Pacifier characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
