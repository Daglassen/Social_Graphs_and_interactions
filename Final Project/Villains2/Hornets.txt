They are extremely expendable and limited in cognitive capabilities, possibly due to being mass produced.\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to ''The Good, the Bad, and the Robotic'' and the August 2000 issue of ''[[Disney Adventures]]'', the Hornets are programmed to respond to every command with the phrase, \"Obey Zurg!\". However, they have never said that in the series.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Buzz Lightyear of Star Command}}\n[[fi:Herhil\u00e4iset]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Buzz Lightyear of Star Command characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
