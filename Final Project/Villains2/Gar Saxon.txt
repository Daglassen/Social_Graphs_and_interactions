During the Clone Wars, he worked for the Shadow Collective led by [[Maul]] until he joined the [[Galactic Empire]] after the collective was dissolved.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn his debut \"[[Imperial Super Commandos]]\", Gar Saxon and his men attacked the Protectors, a Mandalorian clan led by Saxon's rival,\u00a0[[Fenn Rau]],\u00a0in the Concord Dawn system.\u00a0All the Protectors were killed, with the exception of Fenn Rau, who was captured by the Rebels. Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper, accompanied by Fenn, journeyed to Concord Dawn because the lack of communication from the Protector, where\u00a0Saxon captured [[Ezra Bridger]].\u00a0Saxon understood that Ezra was a Rebel. He tried to lie his way out, but Saxon was not an easy fool. He threatened to shoot [[C1-10P|Chopper]] if Ezra continued to deny.\u00a0Ezra used Force to deflect Saxon's shots on Chopper but that also betrayed him and Saxon understood that he was a Jedi.\u00a0[[Sabine Wren]] saved Ezra and briefly escaped until Fenn Rau fled with their ship. Bringing the three Rebels together, Saxon recognized Sabine and offered her to join the Empire with her mother.\u00a0Sabine, Ezra, and Chopper attempted to escape, but Saxon and his men gave chase. Saxon engaged in a fight with the girl until the intervention of Fenn Rau, who had returned after a change of heart.\n\nLater in \"[[Legacy of Mandalore]]\", Saxon arrived at Krownest where he took the [[Darksaber]] and fought against Sabine, who was armed with Ezra's lightsaber. She succeeded in defeating Saxon and spared him. Saxon tried to shoot her in the back but [[Ursa Wren|Ursa]] shot him right in the heart killing him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Saxon's first named appearance was in the unproduced\u00a0''The\u00a0Clone Wars''\u00a0story arc that was later published as the comic book series\u00a0''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''.\n*Pablo Hidalgo\u00a0has described Saxon as \"the quintessential sellout\" willing to serve any master who can advance or secure his own position.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nGar Saxon Clone wars.jpg\nGax Saxon With Imperial Mandalorians.png\nImperial Super Commandos 14.jpeg\nImperial Super Commandos 15.jpeg\nGar Saxon Unmasked.jpg\nImperial Supercommandos thumb.png\nStar_Wars_Rebels_Season_Three_13.jpg\nImperial Supercommandos 4.jpg\nStar Wars Rebels Season Three 15.jpg\nImperial Super Commandos 23.jpeg\nLegacy_of_Mandalore_11.jpg\nLegacy of Mandalore 03.jpg\nImperial Super Commandos concept 4.jpeg\nImperial Super Commandos concept 2.jpeg\nRebels Info - Gar Saxon.jpg\nSWR Mandalorians.png\n6CE48D4D-E98C-42BB-9FDE-13B98D6ED842.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==External Links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Gar Saxon|Wookieepedia}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
