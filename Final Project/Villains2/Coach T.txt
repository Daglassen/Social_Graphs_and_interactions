He is played by Dylan Playfair, who is the son of former Calgary Flames real-life head coach Jim Playfair.\n\n== Biography ==\nDaryl \"Coach T\" Tingman  was the new coach of the Mighty Ducks. He is first seen instructing [[Evan Morrow]] and the current Ducks that they need to choose a new roster of players for the upcoming hockey season. When Evan doesn't impress Coach T with his playing, he decides to cut him from the team. Coach T said that if Evan was not good at hockey then \"Don't bother\".\n\n[[Alex Morrow|Alex]] defends her son in front of the Ducks and the other parents telling Coach T that he shouldn't bother and leaves the stadium to form her own team for her son.\n\nCoach T is later seen announcing the upcoming teams for the season. Before he could finish the announcing ceremony, [[Alex Morrow]] came onto the ice and had Coach T announce her team the \"Don't Bothers\".\n\nThe Don't Bothers second match of the season would be against the Ducks. Thanks to [[Sofi Hanson-Bhatt|Sofi]], the Ducks manage to score 17 goals over the Don't Bothers, however, thanks to [[Gordon Bombay]]'s written play, they manage to score one goal before the game is over, breaking the Ducks streak of straight victories over other teams. This lead Coach T to get angry at the Ducks for letting the opposing team score at least one goal over them and he reprimanded Sofi for letting it happen. This lead to Sofi leaving the Ducks to join the Don't Bothers.\n<br />\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n*Dylan Playfair previously played [[Gil (Descendants)|Gil]] in the [[Disney Channel Original Movies]], ''[[Descendants 2]]'' and [[Descendants 3|''Descendants 3'']].\n*It is unknown if Coach T ever met Gordon Bombay before the events of the show.\n*In episode 6 ''\"[[Spirit of the Ducks]]\"'' his name is revealed to be Daryl Tingman.\n*Like with [[Jack Reilly]] he also is similar to John Kreese from the Karate Kid and willing to turn to cheating to win.\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daryl \"Coach T\" Tingam}}\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
