Lashley is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Lashley is a Gerudo soldier who guards the southeast entrance of Gerudo Town. If Link tries to enter Gerudo Town without a disguise, Lashley will stop him from entering and tell him that men are forbidden. If Link speaks to Lashley, she will reiterate that men are not allowed in the Town and tell him to get out of here.
If Link speaks to Lashley while wearing the Gerudo Set, she tells him that it is dangerous to wander around the Desert because of the Divine Beast Vah Naboris and mentions that the Lookout Post does not guarantee safety. If Link asks about the Divine Beast, Lashley explains that it was said to be a god who protected the Gerudo Desert, but it suddenly appeared and began to wander aimlessly. She says that everyone is afraid that it will wander into Gerudo Town and that their chief, Riju, is doing everything she can do. Lashley also tells of a rumor that Naboris shoots those who come near it with lightning and hopes that it does not come toward the Town. If Link asks about the Lookout Post, Lashley points in its direction and explains that Naboris is monitored from the post. Lashley then questions if Link is going to the Lookout Post and explains that it is farther away than it looks, recommending that Link rides a Sand Seal there. Lashley says that the Divine Beast's lightning cannot reach the Lookout Post, but recommends that Link stays away regardless because of the monsters in the area. Before Link ends the conversation, Lashley tells Link not to worry about the Divine Beast's stomping despite what she said.
After Link calms Naboris and speaks to Lashley, she says that she was worried about Riju leaving on her own. She then mentions that the Chief fought alongside a strong Hylian girl like Link and wonders where she went without realizing that it was Link.
