He is the traitorous vizier of the barbarian land of [[Odiferous]].\n\n==Appearance==\nUnlike the other Odiferans, Runta was a small and puny barbarian, but what he lack in size and might, he made up with cunning and treachery.\n\n==Role in the series==\nRunta's first and only appearance in the series is as the main antagonist of the episode \"[[Stinker Belle]]\". [[Prince Uncouthma]] introduces Runta to [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]]\u00a0as his Royal Vizier and he is going to do the wedding speech. When Uncouthma leaves with the gang, Runta calls his small yak, Zeebu, to get revenge on the barbarian prince. Runta is planning to destroy Uncouthma so he can have [[Brawnhilda]] as his bride. His first revenge is to put a spider on one of the yaks at the yak farm, that way the yak will get so scared, it will hurt Uncouthma and the prince could possibly die. But when the yak does so, Uncouthma is still okay. At the wedding ceremony, when Uncouthma and Brawnhilda are at the altar, Runta makes Zeebu eat a rope so that a yak that is hanging at the ceiling will fall and land on Uncouthma. The plan works when the yak falls on the prince, but Uncouthma is alright. When Runta finds out that Brawnhilda likes Aladdin, he decides to get revenge on him too. At a lake, he and Zeebu take out a boar so that it will attack Aladdin and eat him, but Brawnhilda defeats it. Runta's last revenge is to put two exploding cylindrical cheese on each one of the handles, that way when Aladdin and Uncouthma fight, the mallets will explode and kill them both. [[Genie]] tells the two about the mallets and they go after Runta. Uncouthma catches him and Runta is now giving the wedding speech from behind bars.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Runta/Gallery}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Runta and [[Jafar]] share a few common things: they are both villains (who are not revealed to be bad at first), they're Aladdin's enemies, they are royal viziers who betray or try to find ways to put an end to their masters' lives (Jafar: [[The Sultan]]/Runta: [[Prince Uncouthma]]) so as to seize the thrones and brides (Jafar: [[Jasmine]]/Runta: [[Brawnhilda]]) for themselves, and they have pet sidekicks (Jafar: [[Iago]] (talking parrot)/Runta: Zeebu (small yak)).\n**Unlike Jafar, Runta's pet sidekick does not turn against him, he is diminutive in size, he lacks a little intelligence, he does not possess any magical powers, and he ends up jailed rather than killed at the end.\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
