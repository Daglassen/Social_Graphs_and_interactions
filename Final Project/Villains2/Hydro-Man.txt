Hydro-Man claimed that [[Nick Fury]] was keeping him in this hideout for his own protection, and they decide to bring him to the [[Triskelion]]. However, when Iron Spider looks up Hydro-Man's criminal record and found out that he is a villain, Hydro-Man sheds his charade and attacks the group, causing Iron Spider to do an emergency landing in the Queens neighborhood where Aunt May resides. In order to combat Hydro-Man, Spider-Man, Kid Arachnid, Iron Spider, and Scarlet Spider had to use freeze webs until they ran out. As a final plan, Spider-Man has his fellow spiders throw their web cartridges into Hydro-Man, which caused the released webbing to absorb Hydro-Man. Back at the Triskelion, Spider-Man receives word that the jet carrying Hydro-Man back to his prison got intercepted. This causes Spider-Man to suspect that [[Doctor Octopus]] was behind it and now has a possible candidate for the Sinister Six. This was confirmed in \"The New Sinister 6\" Pt. 1 where Hydro-Man appears as a member of Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six. He is shown sporting a new outfit (similar to the second outfit from the comics). During the attack on the Triskelion, [[Cloak and Dagger (Marvel)|Cloak]] uses his abilities to send Hydro-Man to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Hydro-Man returns where he causes a tidal wave on the Triskelion and then forms a waterspout around it.\n\n=== ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' ===\nIn the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hydro-Man is reimagined as a robotic monster created by [[Mysterio]], who is controlling\u00a0the Elementals to appear to the public as a hero and successor to the late [[Iron Man]]. It attacks Venice, Italy, where Peter Parker and his classmates are having a vacation. Though Peter tries to ward it off, Mysterio eventually arrives and defeats it.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'', Flash mentions a BuzzFeed article that claims that Hydro-Man was a sailor named Morris Bench who acquired water-based superpowers. This is in line with his comic book origins.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''Ultimate Spider-Man''===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nHydro-Man USM Render.png\nhydro man 1.png\nhydro man 2.png\nhydro man 3.png\nhydro man 4.png\nhydro man 5.png\nhydro man 6.png\nhydro man 7.png\nhydro man 8.png\nhydro man 9.png\nhydro man 10.png\nhydro man 11.png\nhydro man 12.png\nhydro man 13.png\nhydro man 14.png\nHydro-Man.jpg\nSinister Seven (The New Sinister Six).png\n</gallery>\n\n===Video Games===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nHydro-Man_Marvel_XP.png|Hydro-Man in ''Marvel: Avengers Alliance''\nHydro-Man-iOS.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
