At Steve's house, Steve and Hallie dance, at the point where Steve tries to make out with her, which she tells him to stop because it's a little too far and he stops and continues dancing with her but tries to make out with her again, which makes her tell him to stop and to take her home but he tells her that he'll take her home later when he's ready so she tells him that she'll walk home and tries to leave.
