He appears in the series finale, \"[[Graduation]]\", where he leads the Lorwardian fleet to invade and nearly conquer the Earth. He is voiced by [[Ron Perlman]].\n\n\n\n==Personality==\nWarhok's cruelty knows no limits. After the failed invasion, out of pure anger he intends to kill [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] and have her stuffed and mounted. He is more ruthless than any villain Kim and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] have faced, being one of the few to attempt to kill both Kim and Ron and the closest to taking over the Earth. Warhok could very well be the most dangerous enemy that Kim and Ron have ever faced.\n\nIt is unknown if he is as devoted as [[Warmonga]] to finding the Great Blue.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Warhok resembles the comic book version of [[Drax the Destroyer]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nWarhok 2.jpg\nWarhok holding Kim.jpg\nWarhok-Warmonga.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
