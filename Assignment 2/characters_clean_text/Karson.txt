Karson is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Karson is an employee of Bolson Construction in East Necluda. He can initially be found attempting to demolish Link's House in Hateno Village. He tells Link that the former owner of the house left to serve at Hyrule Castle and never returned, so he is carrying out the Village's collective decision to clear the land for development. If Link offers to buy the house, Karson will direct him to his boss, Bolson.
Karson will admit to Link that he was hired by Bolson Construction thanks to his name ending in "-son," a requirement for all employees of the company. This inadvertently provides a hint for the Side Quest "From the Ground Up", a Quest to build the population of Tarrey Town in Akkala.
If Link offers to buy the house from Bolson, Karson will cease work on the house and sit underneath a tree nearby, awaiting Bolson's orders. There, he will admit to Link that he finds his construction work to be hard and he idolizes Hudson's ability to work quickly. He also expresses surprise at Link's initiative to purchase a house at his age. Upon the complete purchase of the house, Karson will begin to renovate the house alongside Bolson for a fee of 100 Rupees per addition.


== Trivia ==
If Link speaks to Karson while not wearing a shirt, he will comment on Link's "free"-ness.


== Nomenclature ==
The first half of Karson's name is a variation of the Scandinavian name Karr, which means "reluctant", "curly haired", and "obstinate".
