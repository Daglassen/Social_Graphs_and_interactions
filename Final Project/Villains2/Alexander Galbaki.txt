He is hired by [[Winston Deavor]] to design [[Helen Parr]]\u2019s new Elastigirl costume as Winston assists Helen\u2019s return as a fulltime superheroine.\n\n[[Edna Mode]] despises Galbaki, considering him to be an inferior costume designer. After [[Bob Parr]] mentions Galbaki\u2019s costume, Edna becomes furious. She later declares that she will officially be \u201cMr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and [[Frozone]]\u2019s exclusive designer throughout the known universe and until the end of time.\u201d\n\nNear the end of the movie, Elastigirl's supersuit made by Galbaki rips off on her shoulder after a few days of use, prompting her to use her old supersuit made by Edna.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nAlexander galbaki.PNG\nAlexander.PNG\nAlexander g.PNG\nAlexander and Edna.PNG\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n*Galbaki was supposed to make a physical appearance in ''Incredibles 2''.
