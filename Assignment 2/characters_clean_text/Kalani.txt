Kalani is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Kalani is a Gerudo child who lives in Gerudo Town. Danda is her grandmother. If Link speaks to Kalani while she is standing in front of her grandmother's Arrow Specialty Shop, she encourages Link to buy lots of stuff. She also recommends each type of elemental Arrow, saying that Bomb Arrows go "BOOOOOM!!!", Shock Arrows go "BZZBZZT!!!", Ice Arrows go "CRAAAAACK!!!" and Fire Arrows go "BOOSH!!!". While running around, she tells Link that she does not have time to greet people and that the Rito, Frita, will be gone if she does not hurry. If Link speaks to Kalani while she is staring at Frita, she comments about what a "big vure" she is.
Link can find Kalani and the other three children in Gerudo Town speaking to each other as a group as the sun sets. Kalani asks them if they are in love. Makure then responds that she wants to attend Ashai's class when she grows up and get married. Pearle then comments that Ashai is unmarried and wonders what that means. Lastly, Dalia says that she heard being in love is the sweetest thing in the world, but does not think she can handle something sweeter than berries.
