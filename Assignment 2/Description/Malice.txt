However, the dreaded Malice unleashed by Calamity Ganon has possessed its body and reduced it to this state.|Hylia|BotW}}</ref>{{Name Ref|HWAoC}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n==={{BotW|-}}===\n{{Term|BotW|Malice}} is a thick, black-and-magenta tar-like substance that can be found in several locations throughout {{Term|BotW|Hyrule|link}}. {{Term|BotW|Malice}} can damage {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} upon contact. Malice is typically found in large pools on the ground, but can also cling to the sides of rocks and buildings. Large concentrations of Malice sometimes include large, blunt, slightly curved spikes that impede attempts to pass above them. Some pools of {{Term|BotW|Malice}} have a glowing eyeball which, when destroyed, cause a large chunk of {{Term|BotW|Malice}} to dissipate.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= Glowing eyeballs are a recurring feature in dungeons and wherever large pockets of Malice goo appear, such as in Hyrule Castle.|book= Breath of the Wild Complete Official Guide|publisher= Piggyback|page= 310}}</ref> Inside the {{Plural|BotW|Divine Beast}} and {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle (Breath of the Wild)|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Malice}} may also have a mouth that is able to release {{Plural|BotW|Cursed Bokoblin|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Cursed Moblin|link}}, and {{Plural|BotW|Cursed Lizalfos|link}}. These {{Plural|BotW|Enemy|link}} will continue to spawn and attack {{Term|BotW|Link}} until its corresponding glowing eyeball is destroyed, should there be one.\n\nAt the top of {{Term|BotW|Mount Lanayru|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Link}} can find {{Term|BotW|Naydra|link}} covered in {{Term|BotW|Malice}}.<ref name= \"Naydra\"/> In order to free the {{Term|BotW|Dragon|link}}, he must destroy all the glowing eyeballs around its body. During the final battle with {{Term|BotW|Dark Beast Ganon|link}}, the remaining {{Term|BotW|Malice}} surrounds {{Term|BotW|Ganon}} and converts him into his original form.<ref>{{Cite|After Ganon was defeated by Link, the remaining Malice pulled itself together to form this bestial creature.

Later in the trailer, it is also shown that a large mass of malice is concentrated underneath {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle|link}} causing the castle to move upwards towards the sky.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n{{Stub}}\nMalice first appears as a substance in the {{Term|HWAoC|Scenario|link}} \"{{Term|HWAoC|Freeing Korok Forest|link}},\" where it blocks the path to {{Term|HWAoC|Korok Forest|link}}. In this {{Term|HWAoC|Scenario}}, the Malice had to be destroyed by defeating the {{Plural|HWAoC|Hollow|link}} of each of the {{Plural|HWAoC|Champions|link}}, but in most cases, the glowing eyeball needs to be defeated with a weapon in order to destroy the Malice swamp. Unlike in {{BotW|-}}, Malice is not poisonous - it only serves as a obstacle to block the character's path.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The energy form {{Term|TPHD|Ganon|link}} takes on in {{TP}} is said to be \"'''Ganondorf's Malice'''\".<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= HH |publisher= |page= 113}}</ref>\n*In {{PH}}, {{Plural|PH|Fear Cannon|link}} can supposedly fire \"cannonballs of pure malice\".<ref>{{Cite|Some suspect it can fire cannonballs of pure malice.|Shipyard|PH}}</ref>\n*In {{SS}}, there is an item called {{Term|SSHD|Evil Crystal|link}} which is described as \"pure, crystallized monster malice\".<ref>{{Cite|You got an Evil Crystal!
