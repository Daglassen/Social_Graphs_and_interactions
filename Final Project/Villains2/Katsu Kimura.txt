Lance engages into combat against Kimura to which after knocking him out, he engages in a confrontation against Killian just after he deals with a group of Yakuza agents inside the Iwate Prefecture and later obtains the briefcase from Killian.\n\nWhen Lance asks his computer to know where Kimura is, it is then known that Kimura is at Playa Del Carmen in Mexico, which leads him and Walter on an assignment to find Kimura and ask him to know where Killian went. Lance then uses a receptionist's computer at a hotel riviera to look for Kimura's name to which he manages to retrieve the hotel card to access Kimura's room.\n\nLance then arrives at Kimura's room at a hotel riviera in Playa Del Carmen, to which upon approaching him, he confronts Kimura with Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes following him into Kimura's lair to which Lance explains to Kimura that he sold the M9 Assassin to Killian, demanding him to know where he is. Lance attempts to let Kimura answer his question, but to his empty protests, a nearby lamp above him falls on him just as Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes retreat. Kimura grabs him and tests him to know if he could speak, but Lance bites him to free himself. Lance attempts to smack him, but his strike deals no harm on him, due to Lance being in his pigeon form. Kimura attempts to smash him with a chess table, but [[Walter Beckett|Walter]] arrives and electrocutes Kimura.\n\nLance demands Kimura to know where Killian is to which Walter uses his truth serum gadget against Kimura just as Lance asks him to find Killian to which he explains that he is in Venice on his way to steal the Agent Database to which Kimura warns him that when Killian arrives at the Agent Database, he will use the M9 Assassin to destroy the database unless Lance stops him. Lance and Walter then push Kimura in front of the door to prevent Marcy and the other H.T.U.V. agents from entering just as the two plan to escape to Venice to which Ears fires a blast at the door as Marcy notices an exhausted Kimura just before the two escape. It is unknown of what happened to Kimura afterwards.\n\n==Trivia==\n*During the scene where Lance (in his pigeon form) fights against Kimura in his hotel room at Playa Del Carmen, the lint seen during the battle are actually dust bunnies from Professor Bomba's house from Blue Sky Studios' 2013 animated film, ''Epic'' (made before Disney's purchase in March 2019). <ref>Super Secret Spy Mode bonus feature (''Spies in Disguise'' Blu-ray / Digital formats).</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Spies in Disguise}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Blue Sky Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Fox]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Spies in Disguise characters]]"
