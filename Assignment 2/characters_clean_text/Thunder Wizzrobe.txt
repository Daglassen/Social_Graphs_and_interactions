== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Thunder Wizzrobes are a variant of Electric Wizzrobes. They attack by using their Thunderstorm Rods to cast three balls of electricity, to summon Electric Chuchus and Electric Keese, as well as to summon thunderstorms that will strike Link if he is wielding any metallic Weapon. Thunder Wizzrobes will turn invisible after attacking, however, they leave trails below them. Performing a headshot will stun them, giving Link time to attack. After defeat, they will drop their Thunderstorm Rods.
