He is the head of his fraternity called Delta Nu.\n\nHe used to mock Grady often due to the fact that Grady does not have a girlfriend, while he himself already had several. He, however, grew a newfound sense of respect for his brother after [[Sonny Munroe|Sonny]] defended Grady from [[Blake Radisson]]'s mockery. He likes chasing after girls, and shouting out \"''Delta Nu''\" when happy.\n\nHe is shown as quite hard to break down. Every time Grady and Sonny do something to inspire a \"break up\" between them, Grant always takes it the wrong way so that Grady and Sonny ''can't'' break up. As Sonny says, \"He's harder to kill than a vampire\".\n\nIn the episode \"Sonny With a Grant\", Mr. Condor has Grant become the new Mackenzie after he fires Chad. Also, in \"Grady With a Chance of Sonny\", it is revealed that he likes Sonny. When Grady \"breaks up\" with her, Grant said he would ask Sonny out. Gronny (Grant and Sonny) remain friends now. Grant's only friend in Condor Studios is Sonny Munroe. Grant obviously doesn't have feelings for her anymore, he better not since Sonny's dating [[Chad Dylan Cooper]]. However it is seen at the end of \"Sonny with a Grant\" that Grant might have feelings for [[Tawni Hart|Tawni]]\u00a0and the same could be said vice versa.\n\nGrant is originally from Orlando, [[Florida]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mitchell, Grant}}\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
