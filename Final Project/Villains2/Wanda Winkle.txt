She is Bertram's mother who appeared in\u00a0''Throw Momma From the Terrace''. She and\u00a0Bertram\u00a0have not talked in years until\u00a0Jessie\u00a0set them up and they get along better. She calls Bertram 'Bertrushka' and he calls her 'Mamushka'.\u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*When\u00a0Bertram\u00a0was 10 years old, she made his friend Timmy Schwartz disappear and nobody has seen him since.\n*She made Bertram's valedictorian speech on \"his behalf\" but really because she beat him to the podium.\n*Her full name sounds a lot like\u00a0Wanda Fairywinkle-Cosma\u00a0from\u00a0''The Fairly Oddparents''.\n*Bertram\u00a0does not really like her because he thinks she talks about herself too much.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Jessie}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Winkle, Wanda}}\n[[Category:Jessie characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
