They appear in ''Return of the Jedi ([[1983]])'' and in the second and third prequel films, ''Attack of the Clones'' ([[2002]]) and ''Revenge of the Sith'' ([[2005]]). Royal Guards have been merchandised into action figures and miniatures, and their backstory expanded upon in such works as Dark Horse Comics' ''Crimson Empire'' series. During [[Star Wars Weekends]], they appear during the Hyperspace Hoople, escorting [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]]. They made a brief appearance in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' in episode \"[[Empire Day]]\" where they are on a viewscreen.\n\nThey are later replaced by the [[Praetorian Guard|Elite Praetorian Guard]] to serve [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and the [[First Order]]. Unlike the Empire's Royal Guard, Praetorian Guards were ferocious and competent fighters. In ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'', it is revealed that Emperor managed to revive himself on [[Exegol]], but he is being guarded by the Sovereign Protectors instead of the Royal Guards.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nImperial Royal Guard ROUVG.png\nWDW - Star Wars Weekends 2008 - Jumbo Helmet Emperor's Royal Guard.jpeg\nRoyal Guard Pin - Star Wars.jpg\nPalpatine-RoyalGuard.png\nRogue_One_30.png\nStar Wars Darth Vader 20.jpg\nStar-wars-battlefront-royal-guards.jpg|Emperor's Royal Guard in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront]]''.\nStar Wars Force Arena 8.jpg\nRoyalGuard2014.jpg|[[LEGO]] minifigure\nFunko Pop!
