He is immune to the heat's effect due to the platelets in his blood being resistant to burning. He is placed on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] index and is assigned a case agent, [[Agent Kwan Chen]]. After being injected with the [[Centipede (Marvel)|Centipede]] serum, his powers become stronger.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''===\nChan Ho Yin, as a result of an explosive fire at a building near his apartment in [[Hong Kong]], gained the ability to create and hold fire.\n\nChan Ho Yin only appears in the episode \"[[Girl in the Flowered Dress]]\". He is shown as a street performer, using pyrokinetic abilities, in his hometown of Hong Kong. During his act one night he is noticed by [[Raina]] who talks him into taking her back to his apartment. He is completely unaware as two men in heatproof suits approach and knock him out.\n\nHe awakens in a laboratory where Raina informs him that she is not affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., which was his first suspicion. She claims she will help him harness his powers and help him realize his full potential. He takes on the nickname Scorch which he believes will be a memorable name. However, he is unaware of Centipede's true goal: to discover the reason he does not burn.\n\nTesting the Centipede program on him, Raina and Debbie find out that his blood platelets are the reason he is not burned by his ability. They extract his platelets, taking away his protection from the explosion associated with the Centipede serum.\n\nWhen [[Phil Coulson|Coulson]] and his team attempt to extract Chan, Scorch doses himself with one needle full of the serum and kills [[Agent Kwan Chen|Agent Chen]]. [[Melinda May|May]] attempts to negotiate with Chan, but he refuses to give in. He then blocks Coulson's Night-Night Gun shots with a wall of flames. He corners Debbie, and as a result of her experiments on him, he burns her to ashes.\n\nBecause he no longer has his platelets to prevent an explosion as a result of the serum, Chan will soon explode. Seeing his drive to defeat them, Coulson distracts Scorce as May shoots two more doses of serum into him. He heats up at a more rapid pace and his demise is a fiery explosion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSHIELD_Chan_Ho_Yin.jpg|S.H.I.E.L.D.'s lab readout on Chan\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scorch}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Scorch}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
