Tamara also appeared in an extended [[World of Color]] sequence to promote the film.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===\nTamara takes part in the battle between mermaids and Blackbeard's crew at Whitecap Bay. When Scrum sings \"[[My Jolly Sailor Bold]]\", Tamara first appears before him and seduces him. Entrancing the pirates, she sings Scrum's song as the other mermaids surround the longboat full of Blackbeard's crewmen. Scrum is almost powerless to resist a kiss from the beautiful mermaid, but before succumbing, the mermaid reveals her true form. She tries to attack but is hit with an oar. The mermaids then afterward attack the crew. Fortunately, the crew survives when Jack Sparrow causes an explosion in the tower at Whitecap Bay, causing Tamara and the rest of the mermaids to retreats from the explosion with the exception of Syrena.\n\n==Disney Parks==\n===[[World of Color]]===\nIn an extended sequence to promote ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]'', Tamara can be heard singing \"My Jolly Sailor Bold\", while mermaids continue swimming, shortly before the mermaid attack scene follows.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Before the film, rumors persisted that Tamara was the queen of the mermaids, but no content in the film proves Tamara or any other of the mermaids in a station above the others.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional Images===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nallfons.ru_3907.jpg|Tamara promotional image\nTamaraScrumPromo.jpg\nfilmz.ru_f_73520.jpg|Tamara with the other mermaids.\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nPirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7209.jpg|Tamara appears before the sailors\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7224.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7248.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7259.jpg|''\"Yes.\"''\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7264.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7269.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7273.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7280.jpg\nPirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7299.jpg|\"''are you my jolly sailor bold''\"\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7343.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7358.jpg\nPirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7458.jpg|Tamara luring Scrum into a kiss\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7466.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7470.jpg\npirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-7482.jpg|Tamara's mermaid form.\n</gallery>\n\n====Miscellaneous====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLego Tamara.png|[[LEGO]] Tamara\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:pirates:Tamara|Tamara]] on [[w:c:pirates:Main Page|Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki]]\n\n{{PotCWiki}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Tamara}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Mermaids]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
