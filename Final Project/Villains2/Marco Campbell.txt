When Will confronted him about it Marco and his friends left without incident.\n\nOn the night of the game Will disappears during the game. Marco went in search for him. Going to the school theater, Marco confronted Mr. Moore and was injured. Mr. Moore returns and reveals to Will, Allie and Miles that he is really Mordred and that Marco was actually a member of the Order of the Bear who was sworn to protect Arthur, and had been trying to gain Mr. Moore's trust. Mr. Moore then attacked the group. Allie grabbed a prop sword to stop Mr. Moore, but it transformed into Excalibur, revealing that she was the real reincarnation of King Arthur.

With the help of Merlin, Allie defeated Mordred.\n\nBack in the theater the group are able to escape and Mr. Moore is detained. Marco knelt before Allie and pledge loyalty and fealty to her. Will then returns to the game and he proceeds to win the game.\n\nLater, Marco and the others gathered together at the round table dressed as their legendary counterparts.\n\n== Personality ==\nIn the book series Marco has quite a temper as well as a sharp tongue. He's more than capable and willing to hurt other's feelings. He doesn't take the discovery that he is the reincarnation of Mordred very well.\n\nIn the film he doesn't have these insecurities, however, he pretends to in order to get close to Mr. Moore/Mordred, acting as a spy for the Order of the Bear. When people are in actual danger he will rush in to help. He also pledged undying loyalty to the reincarnation of King Arthur.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Campbell, Marco}}\n[[Category:Avalon High characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
