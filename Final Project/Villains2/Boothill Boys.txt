Given their species and eagerness for their work, it is likely that they use their occupation as a means of feeding themselves.  They get their name from boot-hills, makeshift burial-grounds from the old west where the vultures likely were often seen.\n\n=== Development History ===\nThe Boothill Boys were designed by [[Marc Davis]] to be characters in the defunct [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] attraction [[America Sings]] in [[Disneyland]].  Following the attraction's closure in the 1980s, the Boothill Boys were moved (along with many other America Sings animatronics) to the new attraction, [[Splash Mountain]] in [[Critter Country]].  The Boothill Boys were subsequently recreated for every version of Splash Mountain throughout the Disney Parks.\n\nAs of the announced closure of Splash Mountain in [[2020]] (done due to the ride's [[Song of the South|history of embellishing racism]]), the fate of the two vultures is unclear.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== America Sings ===\nIn America Sings, the Boothill Boys appeared in the third-act of the attraction, themed around the Wild West.  The two vultures appeared perched on a dead tree and sand, \"The End of Billy the Kid\".  This being a song recounting the killings and subsequent death of the famous outlaw gunslinger.\n\n=== Splash Mountain ===\nIn Splash Mountain, the Boothill Boys appear on the lift-hill nearing the ride's climactic drop.  As guests in their logs go up \u00a0[[Chickapin Hill]] and approach [[Br'er Fox]]'s lair following the fox's capture of [[Br'er Rabbit]], the vultures make their perch on a thorn branch overhead of the guests.  The two vultures stare down ominously at guests while cracking dark jokes about the fate of the guests and of Br'er Rabbit, clearly presuming the deaths of both parties for their own gain.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Boothill Boys are similar to the [[Vultures (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs)|vultures]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937).  In [[Walt Disney World]], the vultures from the film appear overhead of guests on a lift-hill in [[Seven Dwarfs Mine Train]]; their positioning being very reminiscent of the vultures in Splash Mountain.\n* The Vultures are some of the few America Sings characters who were more notably featured in merchandise and paraphernalia for Splash Mountain.  In [[2015]], the fictional sports team name for Splash Mountain made for March Madness promotional material was slated as, \"''The [[Briar Patch]] Vultures''\" with the Boothill Boys as the logo.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nAmericaSings Vultures 1974.jpg\nVultures.jpg.JPG\nVultures 1.jpg\nDavis - BootHill.jpg|Concept artwork by [[Marc Davis]]\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Splash Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:America Sings]]"
