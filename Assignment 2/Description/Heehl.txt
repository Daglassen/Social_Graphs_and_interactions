Heehl, along with his brothers, is passionate about training in difficult feats of strength and endurance.  He lives with the rest of his brothers in a house in southern [[Goron City]], which is now abandoned and left with a sign saying they have gone to the [[Gut Check Rock]] to train.<ref>{{Cite|We are currently training at Gut Check Rock north of Death Mountain. Come watch us train at Gut Check Rock!<br>- Bayge, Heehl, and Kabetta|Signpost|BotW}}</ref>\n\nHeehl is involved in the \"[[Test of Will]]\" [[Shrine Quest]] at [[Mount Nabooru]] in the [[Gerudo Highlands]]. Heehl and the other Goron Blood Brothers have traveled  to their ancestral training ground to train themselves to withstand the heat in Goron City.<ref>{{Cite|This is our ancestral training ground!

Heehl is the second Goron to collapse before Link is declared the winner. The brothers then challenge him to a harder contest by standing on an even hotter platform. Beating both of their contests reveals the [[Joloo Nah Shrine]].\n\nHeehl also appears at the base of the Gut Check Rock in northern [[Eldin Canyon]], standing next to one of the [[Updraft]]s near the main gateway. After completing Bayge's [[Gut Check Challenge]], he commends Link on his impressive success.<ref>{{Cite|FEEL THE BURN, BLOOD BRO!
