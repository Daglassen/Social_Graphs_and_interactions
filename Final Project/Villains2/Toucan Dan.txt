[[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] call him \"Lying No-Good Toucan Dan\" because everything he says is a lie. He is a convincing liar and impersonator who makes anyone believe anything he says. He would also do anything to get someone in trouble.\n\n===Physical Description===\nToucan Dan has the ordinary toucan appearance: slender with black and white feathers, blue eyes, and a tri-colored beak. He wears a red fez.\n\n==Role in the series==\nToucan Dan appears in two episodes: \"[[I Don't Bolivia]]\" and \"[[Alcatraz Mataz]]\".\n\n===\"[[I Don't Bolivia]]\"===\nWhen Timon has trouble getting a snail out of its shell, Pumbaa suggests he uses Toucan Dan, who is in a cage with a rope tied to his beak so he doesn't speak. When Timon walks up to the toucan, Pumbaa tells him that Toucan Dan is a liar who makes everyone believe anything he says, according to the signs.\n\nWhen Timon removes the rope from Toucan Dan's beak, Toucan Dan tricks Timon into freeing him from his cage. After Timon does so, [[the Vulture Police]] show up and make Timon recapture Toucan Dan. After Timon and Pumbaa capture Toucan Dan, the toucan repeatedly tricks Timon into freeing him from his cage.\n\n[[File:Idb17.png|thumb|left|200px|Toucan Dan impersonating Timon.]]\nPumbaa has had enough of Toucan Dan repeatedly escaping, so Timon suggests that he impersonates Toucan Dan. The Vulture Police show up and see Timon disguised as Toucan Dan. The vultures release \"Toucan Dan\" and tell him that they're going to feed him to the lions. Timon then admits that he's not really Toucan Dan, but the police won't believe him.\n\nToucan Dan shows up disguised as Timon. Timon and Toucan Dan have Pumbaa determine which one's the real Timon. When the warthog is unable to tell who's who, the Vulture Police put Timon and Toucan Dan in stockades and see which one of the two can easily break the snail's shell. Pumbaa can finally tell which one's the real Timon.\n\n\n===\"[[Alcatraz Mataz]]\"===\n[[File:Am13.png|thumb|250px|Toucan Dan getting confronted by the Vulture Police.]]\n\n{{Quote|You're stuck in there forever whilst I, Toucan Dan, run around free as a bird, which I am.|Toucan Dan to Timon and Pumbaa}}\n\nToucan Dan frames Timon and Pumbaa for stealing a train car full of beak polish. So the Vulture Police throw the duo in jail. Angry at Toucan Dan, Timon and Pumbaa try to escape in order to catch him.\n\nAfter all the attempts to break out of prison, Timon and Pumbaa arrive at Toucan Dan's hideout to make him admit that he stole the train car full of beak polish and told the police they did it. The Vulture Police show up and find out the truth. After they arrest Toucan Dan, they throw Timon and Pumbaa back in prison since they escaped when they told them not to. But then they pull out some spoons, giving off the \"here we go again\" feel.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Toucans]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
