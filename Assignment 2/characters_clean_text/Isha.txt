Isha is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Isha is a jeweler who owns and works in the Jewelry Shop, Starlight Memories, in Gerudo Town. Link cannot purchase from Starlight Memories until he completes the "Tools of the Trade" Side Quest. If Link speaks to Isha, she greets Link, but suggests that she is pressed for time and should not have greeted him. If Link asks what the problem is, she explains that she has run out of the Flint she needs to make her Shop's accessories. She then says that if someone would give her 10 Flint, she would offer a nice reward, but feels that no one would really do that for her. Isha says that she uses Rubies, Sapphires and other Gems to make the accessories and that each gem has a unique power that transfers into the wearer. However, without Flint, Isha cannot make any accessories. Link then receives the "Tools of the Trade" Side Quest and Isha apologizes that he came to the Shop for nothing. If Link attempts to give Isha the Flint without having enough, she appreciates the gesture but explains that she needs 10 of them to do anything. If Link gives her the 10 Flint she needs, she offers him a choice between three jeweled accessories for free. Isha will make Link either Topaz Earrings, a Sapphire Circlet or a Ruby Circlet. After this, the Side Quest is completed and Link can now access Starlight Memories. Link can purchase a variety of jewelry accessories from Isha here. According to Cara, the other owner of Starlight Memories, Isha's real name is actually "Jewel," but she changed it out of embarrassment as she is a jeweler.
