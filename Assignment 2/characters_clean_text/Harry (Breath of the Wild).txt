Harry is a character mentioned in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Harry was a male Horse who lived at Snowfield Stable with his mate Mary and Monkton when he was a child. Monkton was an adventurous child and, as there were no other children around for him to play with, he befriended Harry and Mary and took them with him on his adventures. One day, while exploring the North Lomei Labyrinth, Monkton sent Harry into the maze as a test of courage, but he never returned.
Harry and Mary's descendants currently live in the stalls next to Snowfield Stable, where they are looked after by an elderly Monkton who is determined to take better care of them than he did with their ancestors.


== Trivia ==
Harry and his mate Mary are likely a reference to Harry and Mary, a husband and wife from Spirit Tracks.
