Electric Wizzrobes are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Electric Wizzrobes, like all Wizzrobes, are often found skipping around in the air near ruins. In particular, they can be found on Hyrule Ridge and in West Necluda. They have yellow eyes and wear white robes with a yellow hood. Electric Wizzrobes wield a Lightning Rod, which can shoot balls of electricity.
When an Electric Wizzrobe spots Link, it waves to him before initiating battle. They will often become invisible and reappear before attacking Link with their Lightning Rod. When invisible, they can be tracked by the trail they leave with each step. If Link is struck with the Lightning Rod's electricity, he will drop his equipment, therefore, he must use wooden weapons and Shields to avoid it. Electric Wizzrobes can also summon Electric Chuchus and Electric Keese. They drop their Lightning Rod upon defeat.
