He is the only person who calls the inmates by their birthnames except Hector's. He seems to be friendly but really he is just as mean as [[Warden Walker]] and [[Mr. Sir]]. This is revealed by his constant taunting of Zero and by his total lack of concern for the safety of [[Stanley Yelnats IV|Stanley]] and Zero\u00a0when they are covered in deadly yellow-spotted lizards. He is also revealed at the end to be nothing more than a quack.\n\n===Personality===\nPendanski has a misleading personality, often counseling students but in reality he only tells them rhetorical advice, since he is a quack. He pretends to care for the prisoners, except for Hector Zeroni, who he openly abuses and berates. It is unknown why he refuses to address the campers by their nicknames (even the Warden calls them by such).\n\n==Role in the film==\nPendanski is first seen being introduced to [[Stanley Yelnats IV]]. He reveals a few things about Camp Green Lake and shows him to his tent. He also reveals Mr Sir is not the Warden. He is the only person who calls the inmates by their birthnames except Hector's. He seems to be friendly, giving inmates advice, monitoring them in the evenings, and encouraging Stanley to take accountability for his situation (understandably unaware of his innocence). However, he is really just as mean as the [[Warden Walker|Warden]] and [[Mr. Sir]]. This is revealed by his constant taunting of Zero and by his total lack of concern for the safety of [[Stanley Yelnats IV|Stanley]] and Zero when they are covered in deadly yellow-spotted lizards near the end of the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nDr. Pendanski.jpg\nWarden (21).png\nWarden (22).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Holes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pendanski, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Holes characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
