Then, upon hearing [[Pluto|Pluto's]] howling, Adelbert walks over to the window and peers outside. Upon seeing Pluto, Adelbert tells his father that he wants the dog and throws another tantrum. His father demands that the butler buy Pluto from Mickey.\n\nAfter the butler buys Pluto from [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], Adelbert becomes delighted. He then signals for Pluto to approach him, whacks him on the head and then whacks him in the direction of a toy train track. When Pluto lands, Adelbert activates the train and laughs as the train hits Pluto from behind. His father and the butler shake hands in satisfaction.\n\nSome time later, Adelbert is throwing expensive items, toys and food at Pluto as his father tries to get him to stop. He ends up hitting his father a few times and causes Pluto to trip the Butler. The mansion soon becomes a ransacked mess. Adelbert then launches Pluto from the Christmas tree, ruining it and causing further injury to his father.\n\nUnable to take it anymore, his father tells the butler to throw Pluto out. As Adelbert immediately throws another tantrum demanding Pluto, his father drags him onto his knee, pulls his pants down and spanks him. Pluto watches briefly and laughs as this happens, then leaves to search for Mickey.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\n17806.jpg|Adelbert crying as he refuses toys and throws a tantrum.\nGoodDeedPic.jpg|Adelbert laughing when Pluto tries to get closer to him.\nMickey_Mouse_-_Mickey's_Good_Deed_-_1932_-_YouTube_0002.jpg \n17811.jpg|Adelbert's defeat; getting spanked by his father after the vandalism of his mansion.\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
