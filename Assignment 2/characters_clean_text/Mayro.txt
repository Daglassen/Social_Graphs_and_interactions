== Biography ==
Mayro is a regular at the Foothill Stable in Eldin. He can be found inside the lodge admiring a painting displayed on its wall, which depicts the Stable in Trilby Valley. Mayro comments that the painting was painted by the Stable owner Ozunda, and is so captivated by its composition that he cannot stop looking at it. He adds that the Stable in the painting appears to be depicted from a southern direction. Speaking to him initiates the "A Landscape of a Stable" Shrine Quest, in which the painting provides a clue to finding the Tah Muhl Shrine.
After Link finds the Tah Muhl Shrine, Mayro realizes that there is an Ancient Shrine on the painting's left-hand side. He finds it unusual that a Shrine would be there, and questions who would even go to find it. He is then surprised to hear that Link has already visited it, and admits that there are people determined enough to explore every bit of the world.
