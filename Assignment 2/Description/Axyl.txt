During the day while the adult Gorons mine, he and [[Pelison]] play together. After Pelison leaves for [[Tarrey Town]], he will roll around the mine's pickaxe statue. At night, he mumbles in his sleep about his father and not being able to eat another bite.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|Papa... *grumble*}}|Axyl|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Small|I can't eat another bite... *grumble...*}}|Axyl|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen spoken to, Axyl is surprised to see Link, a [[Hylian]], in the area.<ref>{{Cite|Hm?
