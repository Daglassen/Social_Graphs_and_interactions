He is a dangerous and elusive outlaw.\n\n\n==Role in the Series==\nThe episode starts with [[Sheriff Callie]] chasing after McGraw. Just as Callie is about to lasso McGraw, the cat pulls back a tree branch and it snaps back, leaving Callie hanging and allowing McGraw to escape.\n\nWhen [[Tricky Travis]] and [[Oswald (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Oswald]] come across one of the wanted posters, Travis decides to disguise himself as McGraw and turn himself in to get the reward money. When Oswald comes into town with Travis wearing his Wildcat McGraw disguise, Peck locks Travis up and hands three bags of gold to Oswald. While Callie is out searching for McGraw, she comes across Pecos Pug, who tells her that [[Deputy Peck]] has just locked McGraw away. While Callie goes back to [[Nice and Friendly Corners]], the real McGraw takes note that the sheriff is off his trail, and goes back to resume his wrongdoings.\n\nOswald manages to free Travis from prison, and the two celebrate by getting some baked beans at the saloon. McGraw comes into the bar, catches a glimpse of Travis' disguise, and decides that Travis might make a good partner. But McGraw tells Travis he doesn't like tricksters, so Travis nervously tells him otherwise. McGraw takes Travis along with him while Oswald cowers under a tablecloth.\n\nOut in the open, McGraw spots Pecos' stagecoach approaching and instructs Travis to stop the coach while he prepares to loot it. Travis tries unsuccessfully, and ends up riding on the yoke. After McGraw snaps a branch at Pecos and leaves him hanging, Travis' disguise falls off, exposing his identity. Angry at being deceived, McGraw chases Travis, jumping from one horse to another to try and grab the weasel. But Callie snaps a branch at McGraw, and leaves it hanging. Oswald catches McGraw, thinking it's his partner, and them tosses McGraw in the air after finding out he's mistaken. Callie ensnares McGraw with her lasso, and puts him under arrest.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nWildcat_McGraw_think_again.png\nWildcat McGraw Wanted.png\nThe Real Wildcat McGraw.png\nWildcat whisker twirl.png\nWildcat McGraw busts in.png\nWildcat McGraw at the bar.png\nHe could be my double.png\nMcGraw partnership discussion.png\nDouble McGraws.png\nMcGraw with Travis.png\nGet to it...or else.png\nAngry Wildcat McGraw.png\nMcGraw horse jump.png\nMcGraw hanging.png\nMcGraw disguise won't come off.png\nOswald & McGraw.png\nWildcat McGraw tossed in the air.png\nWildcat McGraw arrested.png\nWildcat McGraw behind bars.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
