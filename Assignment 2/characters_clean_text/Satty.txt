Satty is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Satty is a Hylian Retriever who can be found at Wetland Stable with his owner, Quince. The only reason Quince stays at the Stable is for Satty's sake, since by leaving, he would either abandon Satty or put him in danger.
Quince originally found Satty on Satori Mountain when he was a puppy. Since Satty was one his own, Quince decided to give him some of his food.
At one point, Quince fell asleep and woke up to a glowing beast standing in front of him. He was unable to react, and the beast charged at him. Suddenly, Satty jumped in between them and started barking at the beast, despite his own fear. When the beast recoiled, Quince grabbed Satty and fled from the Mountain. Ever since, the two of them have been best friends.
Like other Hylian Retrievers, Satty can lead Link to a buried Treasure Chest if he's fed enough times. The chest contains an Opal.
