Early in the series, Moblins originally resembled anthropomorphic bulldogs, but beginning in {{ALttP}}, have increasingly acquired more pig- and {{Wp|goblin}}-like features. In all of their appearances, Moblins are characteristically depicted as using spears or javelins as their main weapon. They are abundant in forests but also occasionally appear inside mountains and [[dungeon]]s.\n\nIn the 2D ''Zelda'' games, Moblins are often depicted as common foot soldiers encountered early in the game. In the 3D console ''Zelda'' games, Moblins are instead depicted as elite enemies capable of performing powerful attacks who may engage in full combat with [[Link]]. These Moblins usually require more careful or precise attacks to defeat.\n\nWhile Moblins have changed little aside from their visual appearance throughout the series, some variants of the standard Moblin have also appeared. These include the [[Club Moblin]], exclusive to {{OoT}}; the [[Spear Moblin|Spear]] and [[Bow Moblin]]s, which specialize in spears and [[Bow]]s, respectively; and the [[Shield Moblin]], which carry large Shields. In {{LA}}, {{OoS}}, and {{OoA}}, both bulldog- and pig-like Moblins appear. To differentiate between the two, the pig-like Moblins in those games are known as {{Plural|Series|Boarblin|link}}. The [[King Moblin]] and [[Great Moblin]] are two notable Moblins that have appeared in the series. Other related species with similar names include the [[Bokoblin]], [[Miniblin]], [[Bulblin]] and [[Big Blin]].\n\n{{OTOC}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n==={{TLoZ|-}}===\n{{Main|Red Moblin}}\n{{TLoZManual|Molblin|A bulldog-like goblin who lives in the forest.

They keep to the wooded areas, such as the [[Lost Woods]], and throw spears to attack. These spears can be blocked with the most basic [[Shield]]. Like most enemies in this game, they come in two colors - red and blue; the blue being the stronger of the two, and able to withstand more hits from attacks. When defeated, red Moblins may drop either a [[Heart]], a [[Fairy]] or one [[Rupee]], while blue Moblins may drop either a Heart, one Rupee, four [[Bomb]]s or a [[Clock]].{{Note|If {{Term|TLoZ|Link|link}} defeats 10 enemies without getting hit or teleporting with the {{Term|TLoZ|Recorder|link}}, then the 10th enemy defeated will drop five {{Plural|TLoZ|Rupee|link}}.

They will charge after Link when they see him, like the [[Soldier (Enemy)|Soldiers]] from {{ALttP|-}}. Their blades are also able to parry Link's Sword. Their leader, known as the [[King Moblin]], lives with a small horde in the Moblin Hideout. After Link clears the [[Tail Cave]], he will find that the Moblins have captured [[Madam MeowMeow]]'s [[BowWow]].<ref>{{Cite|AIEEEEEEEE! It's terrrrible! My BowWow was dognapped by... Mo-mo-MOBLINS!!

They patrol the hedge maze of the Forest Meadow and proceed to powerfully charge at Link with their spears whenever they see him.

Red Moblins are the most common, while the blue Moblins are rarer and stronger. In certain dungeons, red Moblins that throw [[Boomerang]]s also appear, similarly to [[Goriya]]s from previous games. Blue Moblins tend to appear during winter. A [[Golden Moblin]] also appears, which shows up after Link has spoken to an [[Old Man]] wearing a golden robe. The Moblin can be found in the [[Woods of Winter]] in the autumn. This variety is much more aggressive and far stronger than the ordinary varieties.\n\nThe [[Great Moblin]] is the boss of a gang of {{Plural|OoS|Pig Warrior}}. They operate a [[Moblin's Keep|Keep]], where the Great Moblin is fought as a miniboss. After his defeat, the {{Plural|OoS|Pig Warrior}} are driven away to the other land in a [[Linked Game]].

Red Moblins are the most common, while the blue Moblins are rarer and stronger. In certain dungeons, red Moblins that throw Boomerangs also appear, similarly to Goriyas from previous games. Blue Moblins often appear in the past while red ones are placed in the same region in the present.\n\nThe Great Moblin is the boss of a gang of {{Plural|OoA|Pig Warrior}}. They operate a Keep, where the Great Moblin is fought as a miniboss. After his defeat, the {{Plural|OoA|Pig Warrior}} are driven away to the other land in a [[Linked Game]].\n\nThe Moblin Ring can be worn to transform Link into the appearance of a green Moblin.\n\n==={{FS|-}}===\n{{Main|Spear Moblin||Bow Moblin}}\nIn {{FS}}, Moblins appear in two forms: a melee spear type, and a ranged Bow type. Spear Moblins attack by charging at the [[Links]] with their spears, which can parry their Swords, whereas Bow Moblins shoot Arrows from afar. Their appearance is identical to the Moblins of {{TWW|-}}. \n\n==={{TWW|-}}===\n{{Tingle|Moblin|It's a '''Moblin'''.  Be careful...He's got a long reach!

Similarly to the Moblins of {{ALttP|-}}, their appearance is distinctively more porcine-like. They are often seen patrolling Ganon's territories, such as [[Submarine]]s, temples, and notably the [[Forsaken Fortress]]. [[Bokoblin]]s and [[Miniblin]]s often accompany them, and one Moblin in particular serves as the mini-boss of [[Dragon Roost Cavern]]. They are sometimes carried into battle on [[Kargaroc]]s.<ref>{{Cite|These fierce and dangerous opponents often carry Bokoblins and Moblins into battle.|N/A|TWW}}</ref> There are two kinds of Moblins in {{TWW|-}}: brown and blue. The brown Moblins appear in the Forsaken Fortress, the [[Earth Temple (The Wind Waker)|Earth Temple]], and the [[Fairy Woods]] at night time, as well as several Submarines and {{Plural|TWWHD|Cave|link}}. This variety can take more hits and carry [[Lantern]]s which they throw at Link when they spot him, acting as a smokescreen of sorts as well as to hurt him with fire.<ref name=\"TWW Guide 31\">{{Cite Guide|quote= |game= TWW|publisher= Prima|page=31}}</ref> The blue Moblins cannot take as many hits and do not carry Lanterns.\n\nMoblins are big and powerful, but not particularly intelligent.<ref name=\"TWW Guide 31\"/> They carry [[Moblin Spear|spears]], which can be picked up and wielded by Link when dropped. Moblins attack by swiping, stabbing, or crushing Link with their spears, which can inflict varying amounts of damage depending on the attack. These attacks also lowers the Moblin's defense, provided if Link can find a safe opening to strike back. Moblins have immense reach with their spears, but their wide swings mean that two or more Moblins in proximity are likely to injure or even kill each other or other enemies. If disarmed, a Moblin proceeds to unleash mighty, lightning-fast punches until it gets its spear back. These attacks send Link flying as he is hit. Moblins may also punch Link in certain instances followed by a spear attack, such as when Link raises his Shield. Link, however, will not sustain any damage from this punch. Moblins are also adept at handling a frontal assault by defending with their spears, so attacking from the sides or back is recommended. If Link strikes the rear-end, the Moblin will comically cry out and briefly hop around, due to the pain inflicted in a delicate place. Notably, Moblins are afraid of explosives, and will flee in terror if Link takes out a Bomb while engaged with a Moblin. They will return to the fight once the Bomb explodes.\n\nWhile infiltrating the Forsaken Fortress to find and rescue his kidnapped [[Aryll|sister]], Link will encounter Moblins patrolling the fortress and will have to avoid them, on account that he had lost his Sword and is unable to fight them. Link can sneak past the Moblins by moving past them as they are facing away, or by picking up [[Barrel]]s and hiding in them when a Moblin is nearby. If Link is caught by a Moblin, he will be thrown into an empty prison cell and will have to escape and reattempt. Once Link retrieves his Sword and revisits the Forsaken Fortress, he can fight the Moblins normally. Moblins also appear to have a keen sense of smell, as they appear to be sniffing out Link as he is sneaking through Forsaken Fortress.\n\nValuable [[Skull Necklace]]s can be [[Thievery#Looting|stolen]] by using the [[Grappling Hook]] or won as spoils by defeating Moblins,which can be sold to [[Dampa the Sailor|Dampa]] near the Bomb Shop, [[Beedle]], or to [[Maggie's Father]] in the [[Auction House]] after the second Forsaken Fortress mission.<ref>{{Cite|I hear there's a fellow on Windfall Island who's collecting Skull Necklaces!

They are identical to those in {{FS|-}}; Spear Moblins charge at Link, while Bow Moblins shoot Arrows. Blue-colored Moblins also appear in the [[Dark Hyrule Castle]], although their strength and resiliency is identical to the more common, brown-colored variety.\n\nAccording to the [[Royal Hyrule Library]]'s weekly top titles, the book \"''Married to the Moblin''\" is the top seller. However, Link cannot read the book in-game.<ref>{{Cite|This week's top titles: 3 Learn to Like Your Like Like: A Good Guide to A Bad Pet 2 Gorman's Guide to Good Grub 1 Married to the Moblin|N/A|TMC}}</ref>\n\n==={{SS|-}}===\n{{Main|Shield Moblin}}\nShield Moblins appear as variants in {{SS}}. They appear as obese red monsters with grotesque features, somewhat resembling the common, smaller [[Bokoblin]]. Their jowls are also somewhat more reminiscent of a bulldog. Shield Moblins in {{SS|-}} come in two varieties: a Wooden Shield variant and a Metal Shield variant. Both types carry large, square-shaped Shields they use to defend with, and are equipped with spears for offense. Their Shields are highly durable; while it is possible to destroy a Moblin's Wooden Shield, the same cannot be done against the Metal Shield variety. Along with their superb defenses, their attacking power makes them elite enemies.\n\n==={{ALBW|-}}===\nIn {{ALBW}}, Moblins are directly based on those from {{ALttP|-}}. They appear throughout [[Lorule]] as common enemies. They come in two varieties: a spear-wielding type, and an armored sword and shield type. The spear-wielding Moblins have an identical appearance to those from {{ALttP|-}}, but with a slightly different attack strategy. These Moblins now back away and try to maintain a distance away from Link as they aim their javelins at him, identically to the [[Spear Soldier]]s of Hyrule. The sword and shield Moblins are an armored variety that carry blades, or alternately a pitchfork, and a shield. They charge directly at Link when they see him, akin to the [[Sword Soldier]]s. Their shields are able to block Link's Sword, so it is advised to attack their unprotected backsides. Both Moblin varieties act as a slightly stronger version of their Hyrulean counterparts.\n\n==={{TFH|-}}===\n{{Main|Spear Throwing Moblin}}\nSpear Throwing Moblins are a named variant in {{TFH}}. They are identical to the spear-wielding Moblins of {{ALBW|-}}, sharing the same model, attack strategy and pattern. Spear Throwing Moblins may also sometimes appear riding [[Totem Armos]], requiring that the Links form a [[Totem]] to reach the Moblin's height to attack. A \"dark\" version of this Moblin also appears in the [[Den of Trials]].\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\n{{Compendium/Extract|Moblin}}\n[[File:BotW Blood Moon Monsters.png|thumb|right|x120px|A {{Term|BotW|Moblin}} being revived during a {{Term|BotW|Blood Moon}} from {{BotW|-}}]]\nIn {{BotW}}, Moblins have a lankier and taller stature than of previous games, which they sustain with an exclusively carnivorous diet.<ref>{{Cite|Moblins<br>These large carnivores require sizable helpings of meat and fish to sustain their bulky frames.|Tips and Tricks|BotW}}</ref> They often wield [[Moblin Club]]s, which they use to bludgeon opponents, or [[Moblin Spear]]s.

They must be defeated to progress to the next floor. Goblins can step back out of range of Link's Sword (although they can still be hit with [[Sword Beam]]s). Goblins attack by throwing their spears at Link, which can be blocked with the Shield by not attacking. Once the floor's Goblin is defeated, Link picks up whatever item was on the floor automatically, the other monsters disappear, and one or two staircases to proceed appear.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n===''The Legend of Zelda'' TV Series===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n[[File:Moblins (The Missing Link).png|thumb|200px|right|The Moblins as seen in the animated series]]\nIn {{TLoZ|TV Series}}, the Moblins greatly resemble their first appearance in the original ''The Legend of Zelda''. They are loyal to their master, Ganon, and they are always willing to follow his every command. As such, Ganon mostly resorts to using these foes to carry out his plans to steal the [[Triforce]]; unfortunately, his schemes are always ruined by the ineptitude of the Moblins, as he is always berating and punishing them for their failure.<ref>{{Cite episode|quote=Blast, blast, blast, blast!

In this story, a Moblin goes to inform Ganon that Link managed to defeat a pack of his fellow fiends to get past his outpost.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote=I-I'm sorry, Master!

These creatures play a much bigger role in this book, being capable of [[Nilbom the Tailor|disguising themselves as humans]] and thus trick Link into thinking that they are there to help him. Both Princess Zelda and Link are first attacked by a gang of Moblins as they are walking through the woods. Although they defeat the first few monsters quite easily, Zelda runs out of Arrows for her Bow and ultimately gets knocked out by a rock thrown at her by one of the Moblins. Link goes after her but trips and tumbles to the ground, and just as he is about to be killed by a Moblin, a tall, dark man known as [[Charles of Moria|Charles]] saves him by commanding the Moblin to leave.\n\nLater on in the book, if Link chooses to go through the [[Midoro Swamp]] on his way to the [[Town of Ruto]], he will once again get ambushed by a group of Moblins; however, with the help of the [[Golden Whistle]], he is able to weaken them with its high-piercing sound. One of the Moblins then offers Link a [[Magic Potion]] in exchange that the young hero stops whistling.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote=Covering his horse's ears with his thick cloak, Link holds the whistle to his lips and blows.

Wooden Shield Moblins are simply referred to as {{Plural|HWDE|Moblin}}, whereas the Metal Shield variant are called {{Plural|HWDE|Shield Moblin|link}}. Both types are equipped with spears that they use to powerfully attack their opponents. They often try to belly flop onto their enemies, either by charging their spear and furiously spinning forward, or by simply jumping towards them. Their fall creates a small shock wave which interrupts any actions currently being done by Warriors if they are unable to dodge it. Aside from the design of Shield, the two variants are otherwise identical with little difference between them.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==={{CoH|-}}===\n{{Ambig|Start}}\nIn {{CoH}}, {{Plural|CoH|Moblin}} are strong enemies that pose a threat to {{Term|CoH|Cadence|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Link|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Yves|link}} and {{Term|CoH|Zelda|link}} both at close range and at a distance. They carry spears, which they will throw at the heroes while moving to the beat of the music. Their beat pattern involves them moving on every other music beat, always crouching before hopping on the next beat as they make their way towards them. When they get close enough, they will pause on one beat to aim their spear, throwing it on the second beat and letting it land on the third. Once it lands, they will try to retrieve their weapon until it is either destroyed or picked up by another Moblin. After they lose their spear, they will try to attack the player head on. There are a total of four variants of Moblin, with {{Plural|CoH|Red Moblin|link}}, {{Plural|CoH|Black Moblin|link}}, and {{Plural|CoH|Purple Moblin|link}} being their stronger counterparts. Regardless of species, all of their spears can be picked up by the heroes at any time with the glove, and throwing it will do double the Moblin's attack damage against any enemy, but at the cost of taking two beats to land.\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n{{Stub|HWAoC}}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"It's a secret to everybody\", the iconic quote from {{TLoZ|-}}, refers to both the actual player, who must keep from friends and family the secret that Rupees can be found there, and to Moblins, as giving Rupees to Link means that they have betrayed their comrades.<ref>{{Cite person|quote= That phrase has several meanings.
