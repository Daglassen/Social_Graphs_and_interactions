It is implied that Wizard Kelly is a pun for Magic Johnson. It is probably more accurate to say that Wizard Kelly's last name comes from the maiden name of Magic Johnson's wife, Earleatha \"Cookie\" Kelly. The gag on Magic Johnson's wife is extended in the fact that Wizard Kelly's wife is mentioned to be named Gingersnaps. The name of the town that the Proud Family lives in is Wizville, [[California]], as shown when Penny gets her driver's license in ''[[The Proud Family Movie]]''.\n\nDespite all the mean things he's done to Oscar, he still attends all of Wizard Kelly's events. \n\nA running gag of the series is his notoriously lousy memory; that he doesn't remember the names of the main characters, no matter how many times they tell him. He always calls [[Zoey Howzer|Zoey]] \"Susie\" and Oscar \"Oliver Prune\".\n\nThe front of Wizard Kelly's face is never shown in any of the episodes. Instead, the shot is awkwardly angled so that he can only be seen from the neck down; but his face has made two separate appearances. Once in the \"Sista Spice\" episode, and in ''The Proud Family Movie'' when they were swept by the peanut butter. Wizard Kelly has [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]-like employees. He is a retired former professional basketball player who made millions creating several entertainment properties.\n\nHe also has a twin brother named Lizard who runs the UBC television network. He owns many stores and businesses in town which makes him the mayor. He has a son named after him and a wife named [[Ginger S. Kelly]]. He also has a pet alien named [[Spats]].\u00a0But remember it all started whit an orange basketbal\n\n==Family==\n*[[Ginger S.

Due to being a large character, his head is modified, though his face is rarely shown until briefly in ''[[The Proud Family Movie]]''.\n*Ironically, it was revealed in \"One in a Million\" that if Oscar had never missed that shot during the big basketball game, Oscar and Wizard would then have each other's lives.\n*Kelly is notorious for never taking responsibility for his mistakes. Lying to Penny about his control over TV shows funded by him, and using Oscar as a decoy to get away from an angry crowd.\n\n==References==\n<references/>{{The Proud Family}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kelly, Wizard}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
