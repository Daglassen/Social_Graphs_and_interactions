He still believes that the Kree are coming after him and is not going to trust anyone, except for Corrina, the woman he loves.\n\nAfter hearing Corrina's sad yet angry words, he lost his will to fight as he banished himself to the other parts of space where he blames himself for all the things he done.\n====''Ultimate Spider-Man''====\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n==Physical Appearance==\n====''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes''====\nBefore being abducted and experimented on by the Kree, he wears a normal civilian attire. In the present, he only wears his pants.\n\nIn his human form, he looks skinny and weak and in his cosmic form, he glows with yellow cosmic energy with muscles and spiky hair.\n\n====''Ultimate Spider-Man''====\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===\nKorvac was a normal human, until whilst driving through a mountain area when he was taken by the\u00a0[[Kree]], and experimented with him for a long time, which gave Korvac incredible destructive powers, which he used to destroy the Kree ship and escape.

After\u00a0[[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] brought his wife,\u00a0Corrina Walters, to the\u00a0Avengers Mansion\u00a0to be with him, the Guardians of the Galaxy appeared in search of Korvac.\n\nHearing Michael Korvac's pleas, the Avengers fought the Guardians as Michael escaped along Wasp and Corrina. When the Guardians explained to the Avengers the threat Korvac represented to the universe, his powers manifested and he knocked out everyone in the scene but Corrina. He escaped with her and a unconscious\u00a0[[Ms. Marvel]]\u00a0who he knocked out in battle. Within\u00a0Adam Warlock's Soul Gem, the Guardians made the Avengers aware of Michael Korvac's true story. After that, both teams worked together to take him down for good. He arrived in Central Park and continued to battle Ms. Marvel under the reason to protect Corrina. When the Avengers and the Guardians arrived, he fought them, but even with their combined powers, Korvac easily defeated them in front of Corrina's eyes. He tried to explain to her that he was only doing that to drive away the \"monsters\" from them, but Corrina replied in saying: \"You're the only monster here, Michael!\" Korvac then teleported himself to the deep space, possibly to another dimension, blaming himself for all the things he had done.\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\nKorvac was an intergalactic warlord who lead the\u00a0[[Chitauri]]\u00a0in their conquest. Taking notice of the powerful figures on the planet\u00a0Earth, including\u00a0the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and\u00a0Doctor Strange, Korvac set out to destroy the planet before those heroes had a chance to stop him. The\u00a0Guardians of the Galaxy, with the help of\u00a0Nova\u00a0and\u00a0Spider-Man, were able to stop his diabolical plan, destroy his flagship, and kill Korvac in the process, putting an end to his reign of terror.\n===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''===\nThis version is a human-shaped alien scientist who was in love with the A.I.
