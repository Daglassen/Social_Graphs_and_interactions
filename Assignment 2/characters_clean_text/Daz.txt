Daz is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Daz is a Korok that runs the General Shoppe, a General Store located in the Great Deku Tree's Navel in the Korok Forest. He gathers his wares himself, from both within and outside the Forest.
When asked, Daz explains that the General Shoppe sells Arrows and Food that he thought would be useful to Link. He recommends using Shock Arrows while it's raining to deal extra damage to enemies.
In addition to selling his wares, Daz will purchase Items from Link. He asks Link to sell whatever he doesn't need, since he enjoys seeing Items from outside of the Korok Forest. He's very pleased to see Link's Inventory. Daz is grateful when Link sells to him, occasionally demanding more Items.
