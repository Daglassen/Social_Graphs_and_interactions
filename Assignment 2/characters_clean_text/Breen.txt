Breen is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Breen is an employee of the Woodland Stable whose job is to help travelers change their Horse's Gear and Mane. If Link approaches her with a Horse, she will offer to change its Gear, though she is only interested in Horses that have developed a strong bond with their riders. If Link's Horse does not have a full bond, she will refuse and tell him to spend more time caring for it. However, if Link's bond with his Horse is fully realized, she will become excited and agree to change the Horse's Gear. From then on, she will change that Horse's Gear without needing to check its affection.
If Link attempts to change the Giant Horse's Gear, she will apologize and inform Link that she does not have any Gear large enough to fit the Horse and that it would not like for its Mane to be handled. Similarly, if Link attempts to change Epona's Gear, she will claim that Epona is too lovely and graceful to change her Gear.
