Worten is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Worten is a Hylian traveler who can be found resting at the Ton Pu Inn in Hateno Village. During the day he spends his time sitting on the Inn's balcony, enjoying the nice weather and drinking from a tankard. He is knowledgeable about many of the major areas throughout Hyrule, and is eager to share when Link speaks with him. If Link asks about Goron City, Worten tells him it is located to the north in the Eldin Region. He admits he did not make it all the way to the city because of the heat. When questioned about Gerudo Town, Worten mentions it is situated out west, in the Gerudo Desert. He describes how he was driven off by the gatekeeper, only to find out later that only women are permitted entry to the Town. He laments he would not have crossed the Desert had he known, and muses he might have gained entry if he were able to fool them into thinking he belonged. If Link inquires about other towns, Worten notes that Zora's Domain and Rito Village are not-to-miss places for those with a strong sense of adventure, but warns that neither are easy to reach due to distance and dangerous roads. 
Worten can be found upstairs in the Inn at night or when it is raining.
