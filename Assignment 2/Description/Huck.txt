We were just talking about that {{Color|BotW Blue|beast in the sky}}.|Huck|BotW}}</ref> He tells Link that [[Revali]], the [[Champion]] of the [[Rito]], once tamed Vah Medoh and used it to protect Rito Village.<ref>{{Cite|Right. A long time ago, the Champion of Rito Village, Revali, tamed {{Color|BotW Blue|that beast}} and used it to protect the village. ...According to the elder, at least.

You need something else? [Who's Revali?] Not that I was there to see it, but... Revali was one of the warriors who died in battle 100 years ago during the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}}.

No, we weave together only the softest, thickest baby feathers that are naturally molted with the changing of the seasons. You will not find {{Color|BotW Blue|clothes}} of this quality anywhere else!
