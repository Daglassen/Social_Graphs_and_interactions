She sits on a stool under the tree next to the [[Blue Flame Pedestal]] at all hours of the day. When spoken to, she will seem depressed.<ref>{{Cite|*sigh...* [Is something wrong?] <small>{{Color|BotW Gray|The}} {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}}{{Color|BotW Gray|...}}</small>|Aya|BotW}}</ref> Upon questioning, she'll explain that her life has been dull since she married, and she previously used to pass the time by staring at the [[Blue Flame]].<ref name=\"Married\">{{Cite|Oh, sorry! Guess I was daydreaming. Life has been so dull since I married into this family. I used to pass the time by staring at the {{Color|BotW Blue|lantern}}'s {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}}...|Aya|BotW}}</ref> However, she notes the [[Robbie|director]] of the [[Akkala Ancient Tech Lab]] hasn't lit the fire in a while.<ref>{{Cite|But the {{Color|BotW Blue|director}} at the {{Color|BotW Blue|Akkala Ancient Tech Lab}} hasn't lit the fire in so long.|Aya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can offer to relight the Blue Flame, which triggers the [[Blue Flame (Mini-Game)|Blue Flame Mini-Game]].<ref>{{Cite|[I'll light it for you.] You? Hmm... That's one possibility, I guess. How fast can you do it? Do you think you can bring the {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}} to this {{Color|BotW Blue|lantern}} in under {{Color|BotW Red|three minutes}}?|Aya|BotW}}</ref> She will charge Link 20 {{Plural|BotW|Rupee|link}} as a horse-handling fee, since she doesn't see how else Link could complete the challenge that fast.<ref>{{Cite|Great! But I'll be taking {{Color|BotW Red|20 rupees}} as a horse-handling fee.|Aya|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Well, you're going to use a horse, right? I don't see any other way to do it that fast. So yeah, {{Color|BotW Red|20 rupees}}.|Aya|BotW}}</ref> She also makes a joke before sending Link out, pretending to count down and then telling Link this is what she'll say before he leaves.<ref>{{Cite|Alrighty... On your mark...get set... {{Big|Three... Two... One... Go!}} See, I'll say that, and then you'll start.|Aya|BotW}}</ref> If Link returns the Blue Flame, Aya will be excited and give Link a [[Purple Rupee]] as a reward.<ref>{{Cite|Unbelievable! It's back! The {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}} is really back! I really ought to do something to thank you, huh?|Aya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nThe next time the Blue Flame goes out, Aya will ask Link to bring it back in one minute.<ref>{{Cite|How fast can you do it? Do you think you can bring the {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}} to this {{Color|BotW Blue|lantern}} in under {{Color|BotW Red|one minute}}?|Aya|BotW}}</ref> After this is done, Aya will reward Link with a [[Silver Rupee]].\n\nWhen the Blue Flame goes out a third time, Aya asks Link to relight the lantern in less than twenty seconds.<ref>{{Cite|How fast can you do it? Do you think you can bring the {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}} to this {{Color|BotW Blue|lantern}} in under {{Color|BotW Red|20 seconds}}?|Aya|BotW}}</ref> The reward for doing this is a [[Gold Rupee]]. On subsequent visits, however, she will only be able to give Link twenty Rupees.<ref>{{Cite|You can try anyway, but the reward is still the same {{Color|BotW Red|20 rupees}}.|Aya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf the Blue Flame is out while it's raining, Aya will remark that Link shouldn't retrieve it due to the poor weather.<ref>{{Cite|The weather's pretty lousy, though, so maybe not.|Aya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAya is happier while the Blue Flame is lit. She asks Link if there's anything as pretty as the Blue Flame, but she doesn't think there is.<ref>{{Cite|Is there anything in all the world as pretty as the {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}}? I'm thinking...no?|Aya|BotW}}</ref> She also finds the Blue Flame to be soothing, and wants to know if Link thinks the same.<ref>{{Cite|*sigh...* Good old {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}}. It's so soothing to stare at, don't you think?|Aya|BotW}}</ref> In addition, she will warn Link against putting it out,<ref>{{Cite|Don't put it out!|Aya|BotW}}</ref> grumbling angrily if he does so.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|{{Color|BotW Gray|I told you not to put it out...}}}}|Aya|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[East Akkala Stable]]\n* [[Khini]]\n* [[Rudi]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
