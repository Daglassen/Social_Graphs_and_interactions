Unfortunately, [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s paficist decisions cause the Serpent Society to escape. While King Cobra believes to have acted by orders of Viper, he was actually being manipulated by [[Ultron]], as the actual Viper had been captured and replaced by a then-recently captured [[Skrull]].\n\nEventually, King Cobra is also captured by the Skrulls and replaced with an imposter. When [[Captain America]] and Viper lead an escape from the Skrull spaceship, King Cobra and others join them and fight against the [[Super Skrull]].\n\nAfter the battle in Washington, D.C. against the Skrulls, both King Cobra and Viper are imprisoned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The rest of the Serpent Society face [[Captain America]] and [[Spider-Man]] to free King Cobra and [[Viper]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSerpent_Society_3.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the comics, Constrictor wasn't a member of the Serpent Society, and outright refused membership.\n*In an [[October 28]], [[2014]] press conference covering Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige initially announced the upcoming film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' with the joke title ''Captain America: Serpent Society''.\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
