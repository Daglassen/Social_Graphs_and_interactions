He is the dumbest of Roger's gang and his father is [[Bob White]], the ex-mayor of Bluffington.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nAlthough he was a recurring in both series, Willie's role evolved when Disney bought the series and he became a more prominent character and, while still being a bully part of Roger's clique, developed more of a separate personality from Roger, along with Roger's other two sidekicks [[Ned Cauphee]] and [[Boomer Bledsoe]]. His lines became much more quotable and perhaps became the funniest character on the show.\n\nAlthough he never became a main character there were a number of episodes from both Nickelodeon and Disney revolving around him including ''Doug Runs'', ''Doug Gets his Wish'', and ''Doug's Patti Beef.'' A usual appearance of Willie in each episode would usually revolve around Willie saying something ridiculous out of the blue and getting corrected by [[Roger Klotz]].\n\nAlthough his role was minor, Willie remains the most recognizable member of Roger's gang.\n\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nWilly.jpg\n</gallery>{{DEFAULTSORT:White, Willy}}\n\n{{Doug}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Doug characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
