Ivee is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ivee is typically found sweeping the ground outside of Hateno's general store, the East Wind. Whenever Link comes close enough, she will call him over with a wave and a greeting, citing the pleasant weather. She will then mention that East Wind is open for business. The woman will urge Link to check the stock inside.
Afterward, Link may ask her a couple of questions. Should Link inquire where he is, she will happily identify the general store once again and note the variation of goods being sold, taking care to mention her father's arrows. If Link decides to ask Ivee who she is, she will be shocked by the question before bringing herself to properly answer. Ivee will continue to stumble over a formal greeting before going with an informal one. The next time he asks, she assures him that she will introduce herself as many times as he likes. If she is finally able to get out the formal greeting she was trying to find before, Ivee becomes incredibly pleased with herself. When Link leaves the conversation, she responds by asking him to return to the shop later.
Ivee stays outside all the way until 9 o'clock in the evening, when she decides to turn in. She mentions that even though the hour is late, the store will be open. Even while asleep, she dreams of beckoning patrons into the shop.
Ivee has a Diary sitting on a side table in her room where she writes down various recipes.
When it is raining outside, Ivee will move from her usual spot to sweep underneath the general store's canopy instead.
