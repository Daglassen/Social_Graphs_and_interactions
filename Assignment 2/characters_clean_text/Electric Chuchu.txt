Electric Chuchus are enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Electric Chuchus can be found in the Gerudo Desert and in areas near Lake Floria. Link will get an electric shock if he touches an Electric Chuchu or is attacked by one. Electric Chuchus will emit an electrical blast when they lunge towards Link, which can shock him if he is within range. Damage will be doubled if Link has any metal equipped. If Link is electrocuted while using any metal equipment he may have equipped, he will drop the equipment.
After releasing their shock, Electric Chuchus will temporarily enter a "powered-down" form, marked by a darker yellow color; during this period, they cannot release additional shocks and can be struck without electrocuting Link. After a few seconds, the Chuchu will re-charge itself and return to its electrified state. If they are defeated while in their powered-up state, they will explode in an electrified blast that will electrocute any vulnerable entities within its range; this will not occur if they are defeated in the powered-down form. Electric Chuchus will drop Yellow Chuchu Jelly upon being defeated.
