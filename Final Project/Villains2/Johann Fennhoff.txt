Because of its ability Leviathan decides to capture him. He was reluctant to join Leviathan but when he saw how they killed a man for refusing, he decides to join them to save the life of his family.\n\nThree years later, Fennhoff called himself as Ivchenko. When Peggy Carter, Jack Thompson, and the Howling Commandos had infiltrated the Red Room Academy, he posed as a prisoner of Leviathan. After being released by Carter, Thompson, and Howling Commandos, Nikola went crazy and took hostage Happy Sam Sawyer; Ivchenko then shot and killed his cellmate.

Shortly after, Carter saw Ivchenko was communicating with someone in another building.\n\nAfter Carter confessed to Dooley the reasons why she helped Stark, the Chief then sent agents to arrest the person who was in the other building; while he was in charge to arrest Ivchenko. Dooley was hypnotized by Ivchenko before he could arrest him. Dooley then locks Jarvis and Carter in a room at the request of Ivchenko. Already uninterrupted, Dooley gives Item 17 to Ivchenko.

Fennhoff and Underwood went to a warehouse of Howard Stark and he heard on the radio that Howard Stark returned to the United States. Fennhoff told Ivchenko that they should return to the city and kidnap Howard Stark. He hypnotized Officer Pike and used him to bring Stark to him before returning to the hangar.\n\nThe plan was a success and Stark was brought before him. Fennhoff told Stark why he hated him and how he take revenge on him. Fennhoff managed to brainwash Stark into believing he was going to save Captain America; so that he would deploy Midnight Oil over Times Square. Fennhoff flees when Agent Carter arrives at the warehouse, allowing Underwood and Carter will fight each other. Fennhoff tried to brainwash Sousa and make him kill Agent Thompson; Sousa pretends to be hypnotized in order to arrest the psychiatrist. Fennhoff was knocked out and arrested by Sousa and Thompson, with a piece of cloth in his mouth to stop him from speaking.\n\nFennhoff was to jail and kept muzzled to prevent him from speaking. There, he met his cellmate, who was a great fan of his work. He listened as Zola told him that it was good that he was in an American prison, as America was the land of opportunities. Zola then gave him a pencil and paper so they can communicate.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFennhoff_Arrest.png\nFenhoff-Valediction.png\nAgent Carter - 1x08 - Valediction - Zola and Fennhoff.png\nFenhoff RRA Prisoner.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the comics, Dr. Johann Fennhoff was brilliant psychiatrist who took the codename of Doctor Faustus.\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fennhoff, Johann}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Agent Carter characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
