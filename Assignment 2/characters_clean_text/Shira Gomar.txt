Shira Gomar is a character in Breath of the Wild. They appear exclusively in The Champions' Ballad DLC Pack.


== Biography ==
Shira Gomar is a Sheikah Monk who serves the Goddess Hylia. Following the first Great Calamity and the ostracism of the Sheikah 10,000 years prior to Breath of the Wild, Shira Gomar became a Monk and constructed an Ancient Shrine to help prepare Link against the threat of Calamity Ganon.
The Shira Gomar Shrine is activated during the "EX Champion Revali's Song" Main Quest, at which point it can then be entered by someone bearing a Sheikah Slate. When Link enters the Shrine, he is greeted by the Monk and is offered the Shrine's Trial in the name of Hylia. If Link completes the Trial, Shira Gomar praises him and rewards the Hylian Champion with a Medoh's Emblem. If this is the first or second Monk that has rewarded Link with a Medoh's Emblem, the Monk will then tell him that he must collect three and state how many remain. If they are the third Monk to reward him with a Medoh's Emblem, Shira Gomar will tell him to go to Divine Beast Vah Medoh. Afterwards, their body will fade away.
