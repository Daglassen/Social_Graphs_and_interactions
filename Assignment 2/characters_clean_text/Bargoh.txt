Bargoh is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Bargoh is a Goron who stands watch between Goron City and the Abandoned North Mine near the Shae Mo'sah Shrine. As a guard, he carries a Cobble Crusher with him. He is tasked with making sure that monsters do not enter the City, which have started to appear following the emergence of the Divine Beast Vah Rudania. If Link tells Bargoh he's lost, he'll suggest climbing up high to get a feel for his surroundings.
As part of his job, Bargoh stops people heading to the Abandoned North Mine due to its danger. However, he allows Link to go through with Bludo's pass.
Link may speak with Bargoh to learn the whereabouts of Yunobo, who passes him several times over the course of the "Divine Beast Vah Rudania" Main Quest. At first, he'll direct Link to the Abandoned North Mine. Later, he'll tell Link that Yunobo is at Bludo's house. Once Yunobo leaves, however, Bargoh will tell Link that he's at the Bridge of Eldin. After Vah Rduania has been calmed, Bargoh tells Link that Yunobo has gone back to Goron City. He also asks Link if something happened on Death Mountain, since it looked like Yunobo had been through something.
