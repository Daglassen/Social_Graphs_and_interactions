He was once a feared warrior who wore a suit of invincible armor. Many tried to defeat him but all failed. When Kileem finally passed away, his spirit possessed the armor. He appeared in the episode \"[[Armored and Dangerous]]\".\n\n==Role in the episode==\nWhen [[Dominus Tusk]] was terrorizing the city of [[Agrabah]] destroying buildings, easily taking care of the city's army and defeating [[Jasmine]], [[The Sultan]] took upon himself to stop the giant minotaur from devastating the entire city by donning the invincible Armor of Kileem, an evil ancestor of his family. Shortly after this, Sultan had Dominus Tusk outmatched in speed and strength. After an intense battle, Tusk's horns were mounted on the wall in the Sultan's newly refurbished throne room, so revealing that he was killed by the Sultan, who was being possessed by the evil spirit of Kileem. Slowly Kileem takes over the Sultan\u2019s thoughts making the poor man plan an invasion of all the other kingdoms of the seven deserts making them part of Agrabah.\n\nIn attempt to restore the Sultan back to normal, Aladdin devises a plan to force him to remove the armor. He lures Kileem to a cliff side high above a river and [[Genie]] pushes him into the river. Aladdin\u2019s plan seem to have worked, though unknown to everyone, Kileem digs a tunnel back to shore then gets his revenge. He knocks the gang out and has the guards arrest Jasmine for treason.\n\nNow that Kileem has taken over the Sultan's thoughts he is prepared to execute Jasmine. Just in time Aladdin saves her and challenges Kileem before he discovers the statue is the source of the spirit's power. Kileem storms at our hero seconds before impact, and Aladdin jumps away causing Kileem to destroy his statue releasing the Sultan from his grasp. His spirit then emerges from the broken statue, then explodes into oblivion.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
