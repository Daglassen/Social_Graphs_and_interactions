He is a large man with a bald head who dresses like a city man. His plan was to kidnap all the two-ni-corns and to shave off all their hair to make a large wig to cover up his really smooth, bald head to get a date with the Womanotaur. When [[Yin (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yin]] and [[Yang (Yin Yang Yo!)|Yang]] reach his lair, which is really his house in a cul-de-sac, Yang uses Man Smash, learned from his comic book hero, U-Dude, and frees the two-ni-corns. He returns in \"[[Game Over]]\" where he attempts to confiscate the Dojo for not paying bills, which he would \"tear down and build an overpriced condo\" only to fail thanks to Dave. The Manotaur is explicitly noted for having five fingers on each hand, as opposed to the \"normal\" four on everyone else in the show. He apparently adores lawyers due to their high pay.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Manotaur's voice actor, Seth MacFarlane, who is best known for creating and starring in Family Guy and American Dad, is one of the only three American voice actors to voice a fictional character in the series, alongside Orlando Brown (of That's So Raven), who voices [[Badfoot]] and Kyle Massey who not only rap the theme song of the show but voiced Yin's boyfriend ship Chad. Mitchell Musso and Jason Earles, two American teen actors, also guest starred in the show but played fictionalized versions of themselves and television personality Nancy O'Dell plays a parody of herself, Nancy O. Delffa.\n**The manotaur's voice is very identical to Stan Smith from ''American Dad!''\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lawyers]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
