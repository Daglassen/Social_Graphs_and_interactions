Several members the crew are recognizable despite the switch animation post Retun Neverland The only notable difference the number crewmates and their noticible youth Aside from Tinker Bell herself this the first occurance Disney characters making the jump from animation Following this Ralph Breaks the Internet also incorperated previously characters House Mouse the crew appears cameo with Captain Hook and Smee They sing Our House Now with the Disney villains Mickey House Villains The crew appears the second season the show flashbacks concerning Captain Hook One when meets Milah

calls out the crew fire cannonballs Ventus and Peter The part the crew Kingdom Hearts played numerous Heartless instead the original characters presumably having been disposed once Hook joined Maleficent alliance The crew Wasteland counterparts once lived Tortooga until Captain Hook was forcibly converted into Beetleworx Skull Island and many them were captured and converted well Smee and few others including Damien Salt and Scurvy Pat escaped Venture Land and have been trying settle there The crew seen during the Peter Pan Flight mini game They are first seen holding Cubby hostage

able defeat the crew and after Captain Hook Although the crew implied dislike Captain Hook obsession kill Peter Pan and their wish leave Neverland sail for treasure again the original film the sequel doesn depict the crew complaining about Captain Hook attempts kill Peter and even enjoy aiding him his plot kidnap Peter and the Lost Boys despite still fearing Captain Hook like most Disney henchmen fearing their boss except for the villagers and Gaston Buddies Gaston four stooges who show fear Gaston the original Beauty and the Beast 1991 film Beauty and the Beast but not the Beauty and the Beast 2017 film live action remake Thus can assume that after finding the treasure the crew may have started appreciate Captain Hook more than before and that maybe they grew hate Peter over the years given his constant attacks them Another possibility that they may loyal Captain Hook because took them under his wing teach them how pirates and that maybe Hook promised them return loot ships once they got rid Peter Pan the deleted song Give You One Guess from the second film Jukes mentions that was just kid when Hook took him and showed him sailor life and Turk and Starkey then follow saying that Peter evaded them for long and that now that they will get rid him they will sail out rob and plunder the song was deleted however the canon status these statements for debate Starkey the crew member Captain Hook threw overboard was his first mate and butler the original novel while Smee was the boatswain Interestingly the original novel and Smee were the only pirates survive The only pirate member names that were confirmed were Wibbles Bill Jukes Black Murphy Mullins Turk Starkey Skylights and Damien Salt unknown all the unnamed pirate crew members will have confirmed names from the play and novel Mullins and unnamed pirates are the only pirates who have patches their right eye unknown Mullins right eye was either damaged not The only pirate that died was Skylights who played the accordion top Captain Hook ship much the latter annoyance that shoots Skylights down Jukes the peglegged pirate the Disney version was described pirate with tattoos the original novel Also during the final battle the play and novel when was given orders Hook fetch the cat nine tails for the children Jukes was either the first second pirate killed Peter revealed that there are various members part Hook crew shown scenes along with the others While the pirates tried pursue John Michael and the lost boys unnamed eye pink shirt pirate can scene climbing along with Wibbles Jukes Turk and the rest the pirates offscreen and would fall along with all the other pirates the crew after Peter cuts the rope The rest the crew does not appear Jake and the Neverland Pirates which presumably took place after Peter Pan could implied that eye pink shirt pirate his twin brother since most them look alike both them have patch their right eye Many the pirates are likely descended from other foreign countries presumed some their accents and mannerisms Turk appears Indian Arabian even Moraccan Black Murphy seems French Canadian Skylights seems Italian Wibbles seems Swedish Mullins appears German and Jukes seems Scottish Irish shown Your Mother and Mine could implied that some the pirates the crew well Smee lost their mothers young age and missed them dearly Los Piratas Garfio"
