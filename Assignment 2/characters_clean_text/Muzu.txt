Muzu is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Muzu is one of the Zora elders on the Zora council and the former teacher of Princess Mipha. Muzu cared greatly for Mipha. He harbors a strong disdain for Hylians, feeling that they were responsible for the events of the Great Calamity and Mipha's death. When Link arrives at Zora's Domain and meets with King Dorephan, Muzu protests the King’s request for Link’s assistance in appeasing the Divine Beast Vah Ruta. Muzu is especially upset and storms off when King Dorephan gives Link the Zora Armor that Mipha crafted for her future husband.
Sidon explains to Muzu that Mipha loved Link, but Muzu vehemently resists the notion. He reluctantly promises that he will help Link only if he is presented with proof of Mipha’s feelings for him. After seeing Link wearing the Zora Armor, which fits the Hylian perfectly, Muzu realizes that Mipha did indeed make the Armor for Link.
When Link returns to King Dorephan’s throne room after appeasing Ruta, Muzu apologizes for his behavior and acknowledges Link's noble intentions. He concedes that he and the older generation of Zora may have misunderstood Hylians and asks for Link's forgiveness.
