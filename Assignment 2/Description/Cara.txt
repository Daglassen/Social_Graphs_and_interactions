I'm sorry, but the {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Jewelers}} isn't open right now...|Cara|BotW}}</ref> She goes on to explain that with the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Naboris|link}} around and the theft of the [[Thunder Helm]],<ref name=\"Own\"/> Gerudo Town has been facing many problems lately.<ref>{{Cite|The village is facing quite a few problems lately. *sigh*|Cara|BotW}}</ref> \n\nAfter Link completes the \"{{Term|BotW|Tools of the Trade|link}}\" {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}}, Cara will tell him secrets about Isha as thanks.<ref>{{Cite|I heard you brought some flint for us, little vai. You're a lifesaver! {{Small|How about...I tell you one of the owner's secrets as my way of saying sarqso?}}|Cara|BotW}}</ref> One secret is the fact that Isha's name is actually \"Jewel\", but she thought it was embarrassing to be a jeweler named Jewel.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|The owner's name is actually an alias.
