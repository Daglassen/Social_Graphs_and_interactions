From that point on Gargon's only concern was the preservation of his newly acquired power. So when the [[Saurians|Saurian]] spy [[Chameleon]] appeared in the form of the Prince in a misguided attempt keeping a low profile while in Atlantis, he accepted it so long as he could continue to reign over Atlantis. When the real Prince V'Lara but actually returned thanks to the help of [[Wildwing Flashblade]], Gargon panicked and tricked the royal guard into attacking the pair. Once the two prevailed and revealed Gargon's actions, he was transformed into a dog as punishment.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Gargon's name is an in-joke reference to the 1950's film \"Teenagers from Outer Space\".\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
