Hands's first historical mention was in 1718, when Blackbeard gave him command of\u00a0David Herriot's ship\u00a0''Adventure''\u00a0after Herriot was captured by Teach in March 1718.\n\n==Role in the Film==\nWhen [[Jim Hawkins (Treasure Island)|Jim Hawkins]] comes back from meeting Ben Gunn, he finds Israel Hands, a treacherous pirate and crew member, has decided to usurp the\u00a0''Hispianola''\u00a0and make off with the ship for himself. Israel Hands is injured as his leg has been smitten by a cannonball from the earlier battle, but Israel fights Jim and crawls up the mast despite his leg being injured. He aims to slit Jim's throat and make off with the ship but he manipulates Jim into steering the ship around to a deserted cove. Israel battles with Jim on the mast but eventually calls a truce, saying they both have the same articles and should be working together. Israel tricks Jim into letting him climb up but Jim knows Israel wants to kill him so he knocks him off the mast into the deep water below where Israel drowns, unable to swim. Captain Charles Johnson\u00a0wrote that Hands was shot in the knee by Teach after Teach fired at another of his crew, missing him but striking Hands. Hands supposedly asked Teach for his reasons, whereupon Teach remarked \"that if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was.\" Another theory is that Teach shot him so he would not die in the battle against\u00a0Robert Maynard.\u00a0When Teach was killed by Maynard, Hands was captured and taken to\u00a0Virginia\u00a0for trial. In exchange for a\u00a0pardon, Hands testified against corrupt\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0officials with whom Teach had consorted. What happened to Hands after this is not known for certain; however, in Captain Charles Johnson's\u00a0''A General History of the Pyrates'', Hands is said to have died a beggar in London.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hands, Israel}}\n[[Category:Treasure Island characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
