He is a ruthless, power-hungry and coldblooded warmongering scientist and doctor of robotics as well as the former mentor of [[Gyro Gearloose]].\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nDr. Akita is shown to be a manipulative scientist who wants to take over Tokyolk during development of B.O.Y.D. being designed to protect the city. However, it turns out that Akita is only causing him to destroy the city thanks to his suspicious plans.\n\n==Role in the series==\nDr. Akita appears in the Season 3 episode, \"[[Astro B.O.Y.D.!]]\" as the main antagonist.\n\nWhile seen in B.O.Y.D.'s mind at the start, Dr. Akita does not physically appear until the Tokyolk sequence where he is first seen watching over [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey]], [[Gyro Gearloose|Gyro]], [[B.O.Y.D.]], and [[Gizmoduck]] arriving towards his lab feeling curious about what he is suspiciously seeing to which he spies B.O.Y.D., to which he calls him \"2-BO\" to be welcomed back to be destructive upon seeing a newspaper headlining him and Gyro to be blamed for the cause of B.O.Y.D. destroying Japan's metropolis city. Later, he spies Huey riding in B.O.Y.D. in flight as he plans to take him back to be programmed to destroy, just as he leaves his lab, finding out he has not captured him for twenty years. While talking about B.O.Y.D.'s bad reputation, Gyro shows him a tablet revealing a flashback of Akita and Gyro inventing B.O.Y.D. to be Tokyolk's defense robot until he lost control and attacked the city until Inspector Tezuka stops him. As the gang chases after him, Akita faces B.O.Y.D. for abandoning him after escaping the lab just as he plans to take revenge against against Tezuka and Gyro as it is found out that Akita betrayed Gyro for his actions.\n\nAs Gizmoduck tries to stop B.O.Y.D., Dr. Akita rises and reveals his true nature towards Gyro and his friends just as he tells B.O.Y.D. to kill Tezuka. Trying to deal with his bad reputation, Huey shows Gyro and Tezuka about the footage with his relationship with Akita during his collaboration with him creating B.O.Y.D. just as he programs him to be a destructive robot to defend Tokyolk only to cause havoc across the city. Gyro then confronts Dr. Akita for betraying him by forcing B.O.Y.D. to be destructive in a plan to destroy the city. Confronting him on a platform, Akita tells Gyro that he will never invent anything with him just as [[Little Helper|Lil Bulb]] punches him and knocks him off a platform just as Inspector Tezuka arrests him for his crimes.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Akita serves as a dark parallel to [[Gyro Gearloose]] as both are intelligent scientists and have interns. However, while Gearloose makes inventions for good intentions, programmed B.O.Y.D. to be a real boy, and treating Fenton strictly but kind. Akita, on the other hand, makes inventions for evil intentions, programmed B.O.Y.D. as a destructive robot, and abusing Gearloose very harshly but traitorously.\n**Akita was also responsible for shaping Gearloose into who he is in the reboot series.\n*At one point where Akita spies on the heroes entering his lab, his bag of potato chips includes a mascot resembling a character from the ''Osomatsu-kun'' series. He is even seen doing the \"Sheeh\" pose from the series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAkita_in_the_trash_bin.jpg|Akita's defeat.\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
