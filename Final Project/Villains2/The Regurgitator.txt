He is a villain that is set at high priority at the [[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|O.W.C.A.]] because he is supposedly more evil than [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Dr. Doofenshmirtz]] in the episode, ''[[Oh, There You Are, Perry]]''.\n\n==History==\nAfter [[Agent P]]\u00a0is assigned to him, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is sent a welcome basket from the Agency that comes with a letter informing him about his \"low priority,\" and so he goes to the Regurgitator's lair to try and restore himself to a higher priority again. The Regurgitator gives Dr. Doofenshmirtz a form to apply for a 3 year internship at his lair. Dr. Doofenshmirtz accepts, and starts working.\n\nDr. Doofenshmirtz, however, begins having doubts when the Regurgitator says that he is not going to explain his plan to Perry before killing him. Feeling underappreciated, Dr. Doofenshmirtz tells him about all the things he's made for the Regurgitator, a pair of rocket boots to reach the files in his wall, and a self-destruction system for the lair that is already counting down. It turns out that Doofenshmirtz also builds a release button inside Perry's cage. Perry presses it, and escapes.\n\nHe flips the switch on the tube that Dr. Doofenshmirtz entered through, causing it to start sucking upwards, making the Regurgitator get sucked up it, and shoot through the building into the sky. Perry puts on the rocket boots, grabs Dr. Doofenshmirtz, and flies away. The Regurgitator then lands in the O.W.C.A.'s prison.\n\nHe also appears briefly in \"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\" with Kevin Destructicon.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Oh, There You Are, Perry]]\"\n*\"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\" (Cameo)\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Regurgitator bears some resemblance to the [[Drill Sergeant (Phineas and Ferb)|Unnamed Drill Sergeant]] from \"[[Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!]]\", also voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. The prison he lands in also looks like the Sergeant's Smile Away Reformatory School.\n*It is stated that he lives in the Quad-State Area. While this is probably just a way to show him being superior to Doofenshmirtz, the Quad-State Area could be around four corners in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, because of its desert-like appearance.\n*He probably was known by crime-hunters because he was enlisted as \"The World's Most Evil Villain\" on his own web page.\n*The world was his nemesis until [[Perry the Platypus]] is assigned to be his nemesis.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nKevin and Regurginator.jpg|The Regurgitator's cameo in Rollercoaster the Musical\nTHE REGURGITATOR.jpg\nTHE REGURGITATOR STANDING.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Regurgitator, The}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
