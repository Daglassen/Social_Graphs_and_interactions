"[[File:Tyler.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Tyler'''\u00a0is a\u00a0Macluhan Middle School\u00a0student and antagonist from ''[[Fillmore!]]''. He is voiced by\u00a0Chris Marquette.<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Fillmore/Tyler/</ref>\n\n==History==\nTyler appears in \"[[South of Friendship, North of Honour]]\". He is a well-known pig-napper and is first seen riding a pig through the school's hall while being pursued by [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]]. Tyler and the pig end up on a stage in the auditorium, but are stopped by Wayne, who drops from the rafters above them on a sack that's hung from the ceiling and causes Tyler to fall into a pile of hay. Later, when Wayne is suspected and accused of being the culprit behind the stolen pralines and gets booted off the force, Tyler joins the\u00a0Tennessee Safety Patrol\u00a0and replaces him. When Wayne is seen in detention with Tyler watching him,\u00a0Jeter\u00a0heads to the classroom and tells him that he's needed by Fillmore. Wayne is on his way to his aid, but Tyler attempts to stop him. The latter is then hung on a hook and the dog,\u00a0Jeremiah, keeps an eye on him.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Fillmore!}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
