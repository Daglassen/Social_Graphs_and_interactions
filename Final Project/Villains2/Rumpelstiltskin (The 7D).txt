His shorts include dark green and green yellow strips and dark green pointed shoes. He also has large bushy eyebrows, pointy ears and a huge beard.\n\n== In the series ==\nThe Duke of Drear was an inspiring rock singer, whom twenty-five years ago wanted to get a gold record plaque. So he struck a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to exchange his first-born daughter Hildy for the plaque. However, the deal had seemingly went bad (though the duke still has the plaque) so Rumpelstiltskin started to search for the Duke and Duchess and Hildy to get his due. At the end, he finally spotted the family at the\u00a0Fancy Shmantzy Beachside Resort\u00a0and gave chase through the beach. Earlier, The Duke of Drear had mistakes Grumpy for Rumpelstiltskin.\u00a0Grumpy\u00a0only actually confronted the duke several times because he was hogging the shrimp sauce that Grumpy wanted to eat his own shrimp with.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The 7D}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The 7D characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
