Following their debut in {{TLoZ}}, they have since become a staple of {{TLoZ|Series}} and have appeared in the majority of games with the exception of {{TAoL}}, where {{Plural|Series|Keese}} are absent and are instead replaced by the similar {{Plural|Series|Ache|link}}.\n\n{{Plural|Series|Keese}} often exist in clusters in the places where they are found. They fly around the screen erratically, not heading towards anything in particular, and stop to rest for a short amount of time on a neighboring wall or rock face. In some games, such as {{ALttP}} and {{LA}}, {{Plural|Series|Keese}} move about the screen only when {{Term|Series|Link|link}} is within close proximity, otherwise they remain still. Later games, such as {{TWW}} and {{TP}}, introduce {{Plural|Series|Keese}} with a slightly more active attack strategy, targeting {{Term|Series|Link}}, but pausing above him before striking, providing an opportunity for him to strike.\n\nAs small and commonplace creatures, {{Plural|Series|Keese}} are relatively weak and can be dispatched with a variety of weaponry, from {{Plural|Series|Sword|link}} and {{Plural|Series|Boomerang|link}} to {{Plural|Series|Arrow|link}} and {{Plural|Series|Bomb|link}}.\n\n{{Plural|Series|Keese}} are known to inhabit various forms in adapting to their surrounding environment. Notable variants include {{Plural|Series|Fire Keese|link}} and {{Plural|Series|Ice Keese|link}}, which are enveloped in fiery and icy mist, respectively. Less common forms include {{Plural|Series|Keese Swarm|link}}, {{Plural|Series|Shadow Keese|link}}, {{Plural|Series|Thunder Keese|link}} and {{Plural|Series|Dark Keese|link}}. {{Plural|Series|Vire|link}}, when defeated, will also split into a pair of {{Plural|Series|Keese}}, which may or may not be fought.<ref name=\"TLoZ Manual\"/>\n\n==={{TLoZ|-}}===\n{{TLoZManual|Vire & Keese|Vire is a devil that controls the Keeses. When Link cuts it with his sword, it turns into two Keeses. Keeses have little attacking power, but Vire is a little stronger.}}\n{{Plural|TLoZ|Keese}} inhabit {{Plural|TLoZ|Dungeon|link}} in {{TLoZ}}. They resemble blue bats, and commonly appear in small to medium-sized groups. {{Plural|TLoZ|Keese}} flutter through rooms in a random path, stopping only periodically to rest. They are also the only enemies that are encountered in the game's side-scrolling chambers, where they can be found resting against the walls before taking flight. {{Plural|TLoZ|Keese}} can be defeated by any weapon in {{Term|TLoZ|Link|link}}'s arsenal, including the {{Term|TLoZ|Sword|link}}, {{Term|TLoZ|Bow|link}} and {{Term|TLoZ|Candle|link}}. As they are very small enemies, the {{Term|TLoZ|Boomerang|link}} will also defeat them as opposed to stunning them. {{Plural|TLoZ|Vire|link}} will split into two red {{Plural|TLoZ|Keese}} when defeated. These {{Plural|TLoZ|Keese}} are fought in the same manner as the common variety. {{Plural|TLoZ|Keese}} never drop any items when defeated.\n\n==={{ALttP|-}}===\n[[File:Keese ALttP.gif|30px|left]]\n{{Plural|ALttP|Keese}} inhabit {{Plural|ALttP|Cave|link}} and tunnels in the {{Term|ALttP|Light World|link}} of {{Term|ALttP|Hyrule|link}} in {{ALttP}}. Unlike their previous incarnation, {{Plural|ALttP|Keese}} remain still along {{Term|ALttP|Cave}} walls and crevices, but take flight when {{Term|ALttP|Link|link}} draws close. {{Plural|ALttP|Keese}} in {{ALttP|-}} have a more direct flight pattern than previous appearances, soaring in a curving arc as opposed to random flight, before resting again on the next wall. They are also encountered less frequently in groups, though they can still occasionally be found huddled together. They are weak enemies and can be defeated by any means of attack. In the [[Game Boy Advance]] version of {{ALttP}}, {{Plural|ALttP|Keese}} also appear as enemies in the {{Term|ALttP|Palace of the Four Sword|link}}.\n\nThe {{Term|ALttP|Dark World|link}} counterparts of {{Plural|ALttP|Keese}} are {{Plural|ALttP|Chasupa|link}}, which behave identically but are significantly stronger.\n\n==={{LA|-}}===\n{{Plural|LANS|Keese}} often appear in small groups in {{Plural|LANS|Cave|link}} and {{Plural|LANS|Dungeon|link}} in {{LA}}. They remain still until {{Term|LANS|Link|link}} approaches, whereupon they take to the air and fly in a curving arc before briefly stopping to rest. They are much smaller than past appearances, and their darker coloration provides camoflauge against pits and makes them difficult to see. Despite this, {{Plural|LANS|Keese}} are still weak enemies and can be defeated by any attack.\n\n{{Plural|LANS|Battle Bat|link}} are a similar enemy summoned by the {{Term|LANS|Grim Creeper|link}}, and are also referred to as {{Plural|LANS|Keese}}.<ref>{{Cite Guide|quote= |game= LA|publisher= Nintendo|page= 75}}</ref> When {{Plural|LANS|Vire|link}} are defeated, they will turn into a pair of {{Plural|LANS|Keese}} with skull faces, attempting to dive at {{Term|LANS|Link}} before flying away.\n\n==={{OoT|-}}===\n{{Navi|Keese|'''Keese'''<br>When you get close to it, use Z Targeting.

They can occasionally be found huddled against walls, but take flight when disturbed. {{Plural|OoT3D|Keese}} are also much more aggressive, and will attempt to dive at {{Term|OoT3D|Link|link}} whenever they spot him. Their attacks can be blocked by holding up the {{Term|OoT3D|Shield|link}}. {{Plural|OoT3D|Keese}} can be defeated with any conventional weapon; however, due to the 3D environment and their high-altitude flight, {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} may have to resort to using ranged weapons such as the {{Term|OoT3D|Fairy Slingshot|link}}, {{Term|OoT3D|Boomerang|link}}, {{Term|OoT3D|Fairy Bow|link}} or {{Term|OoT3D|Hookshot|link}} to reach these enemies. Yet as many are constantly in flight, they can be difficult to aim at without {{Term|OoT3D|Targeting|link}}. {{Plural|OoT3D|Keese}} in {{OoT|-}} do not inhabit {{Plural|OoT3D|Cave|link}}, and are instead only encountered in {{Plural|OoT3D|Dungeon|link}}, especially within dark corridors.\n\n{{OoT|-}} also introduces two variations: {{Plural|OoT3D|Fire Keese|link}} and {{Plural|OoT3D|Ice Keese|link}}. They are {{Plural|OoT3D|Keese}} that are enveloped in fiery and icy mist, respectively. {{Plural|OoT3D|Fire Keese|display=Fire}} and {{Plural|OoT3D|Ice Keese}} can transform into normal {{Plural|OoT3D|Keese}} and vice versa; they can have their flames or mists extinguished by blocking their attacks with the {{Term|OoT3D|Shield}}, while a standard {{Term|OoT3D|Keese}} can become a {{Term|OoT3D|Fire Keese|display=Fire}} or {{Term|OoT3D|Ice Keese}} if they fly into fire or {{Term|OoT3D|Blue Fire|link}}, respectively.\n\n==={{MM|-}}===\n{{Tatl|Keese|What?!

They fly through the space they inhabit, and dive at {{Term|MM3D|Link|link}} whenever they spot him. Long-range weapons, such as the {{Term|MM3D|Boomerang|link}}, the {{Term|MM3D|Hero's Bow|link}}, and the {{Term|MM3D|Hookshot|link}}, are effective against them. They can only be found in a few areas, including {{Term|MM3D|Beneath the Well|link}} and the {{Term|MM3D|Stone Tower Temple|link}}.\n\n{{Plural|MM3D|Fire Keese|link|display=Fire}} and {{Plural|MM3D|Ice Keese|link}} reappear in {{MM|-}}, identically to those from {{OoT|-}}. {{MM|-}} also introduces similar enemies called {{Plural|MM3D|Bad Bat|link}}. These enemies behave similarly to {{Plural|MM3D|Keese}}, but are much larger in size.\n\n==={{OoS|-}}===\n{{Plural|OoS|Keese}} closely resemble their {{LA|-}} incarnation in {{OoS}}, appearing as small, dark-colored bats. They inhabit caverns and {{Plural|OoS|Dungeon|link}} in large groups. {{Plural|OoS|Keese}} are easily disturbed, and will fly sporadically around their space. Like those from {{LA|-}}, their small size and dark coloration can make them difficult to see, especially over dark pits or against the walls of side-scrolling areas. They can be defeated by any means of attack.\n\n{{Plural|OoS|Fire Keese|link}} also appear in {{OoS|-}}. {{Plural|OoS|Fire Keese}} whose flames have been extinguished will revert back into ordinary {{Plural|OoS|Keese}}, though they retain their original flight pattern and can fly through fire to turn back into {{Plural|OoS|Fire Keese}}.\n\n{{Term|OoS|Vire|link}} will turn into a pair of {{Plural|OoS|Keese}} with skull faces when it is defeated.\n\n==={{OoA|-}}===\n{{Plural|OoA|Keese}} closely resemble their {{LA|-}} incarnation in {{OoA}}, appearing as small, dark-colored bats.

Like those from {{LA|-}}, their small size and dark coloration can make them difficult to see, especially over dark pits or against the walls of side-scrolling areas.

They constantly fly around the areas they inhabit, and will fly over to {{Term|TWWHD|Link|link}} when they notice him. Their attack strategy differs slightly from previous appearances, and they will pause just before striking {{Term|TWWHD|Link}}. Any conventional weapons are effective against them, with long-ranged weapons, such as the {{Term|TWWHD|Boomerang|link}}, the {{Term|TWWHD|Hero's Bow|link}}, and the {{Term|TWWHD|Hookshot|link}}, necessary to engage them from a distance.\n\n{{Plural|TWWHD|Fire Keese|link}} also appear in {{TWW|-}}. They can be turned into normal {{Plural|TWWHD|Keese}} by blowing out their flames with the {{Term|TWWHD|Deku Leaf|link}}.\n\n==={{FSA|-}}===\n{{Plural|FSA|Keese}} in {{FSA}} are based on those from {{ALttP|-}}. They initially sit still, but fly in a curving path as they are approached by the {{Plural|FSA|Link|link}}. They can be found inside caverns and {{Plural|FSA|Dungeon|link}}. Unlike other appearances, {{Plural|FSA|Keese}} in {{FSA|-}} often appear alone or secluded from one another. They can be defeated with a single strike from the {{Term|FSA|Sword|link}}.\n\n{{FSA|-}} also introduces a variant called a {{Term|FSA|Keese Swarm|link}}. These enemies surround the {{Plural|FSA|Link}} in a trail of copies, and can only be defeated by striking the {{Term|FSA|Keese Swarm|display=Swarm}}'s red {{Term|FSA|Keese}}.\n\n==={{TMC|-}}===\n{{Figurine|TMC|Keese}}\n{{Plural|TMC|Keese}} in {{TMC}} appear and behave similarly to those from {{OoS}} and {{OoA}}. They are small enemies that are easily disturbed and flap about rooms in an unpredictable pattern, stopping only periodically to rest. Unlike other appearances, they have no way to camouflage themselves, and they inhabit {{Plural|TMC|Cave|link}} and {{Plural|TMC|Dungeon|link}} across {{Term|TMC|Hyrule|link}}. Any conventional weapon can defeat them.\n\n==={{TP|-}}===\n{{Plural|TPHD|Keese}} in {{TP}} more closely resemble real-world bats, but with ghastly features and tattered wings, as well as the addition of a curved hook on their tails. These enemies are constantly in flight as they patrol the space they occupy. Similarly to those of {{TWW|-}}, {{Plural|TPHD|Keese}} fly at {{Term|TPHD|Link|link}} and pause before striking, giving him an opportunity to attack before they do. As small and lightweight enemies, any weapon in {{Term|TPHD|Link}}'s arsenal is able to defeat them.\n\n{{Plural|TPHD|Fire Keese|link|display=Fire}} and {{Plural|TPHD|Ice Keese|link}} reappear in {{TP|-}}. The {{Term|TPHD|Gale Boomerang|link}} can be used to extinguish their flames and icy mist, turning them back into normal {{Plural|TPHD|Keese}}. {{Plural|TPHD|Shadow Keese|link}} are a {{Term|TPHD|Twilight|link}} version that only appear in the {{Term|TPHD|Twilight Realm|link}}.\n\n==={{PH|-}}===\n{{Plural|PH|Keese}} in {{PH}} are common enemies that inhabit {{Plural|PH|Cave|link}} and {{Plural|PH|Dungeon|link}}. Closer to their 3D console appearances, they are constantly in flight and fly in circular, random motions, and often appear in small groups. These enemies can be easily defeated merely by striking them with the {{Term|PH|Sword|link}}, though many other weapons are also effective at dispatching them.\n\n{{Plural|PH|Fire Keese|link|display=Fire}} and {{Plural|PH|Ice Keese|link}} reappear in {{PH|-}}.\n\n==={{ST|-}}===\n{{Plural|ST|Keese}} in {{ST}} are common enemies that inhabit {{Plural|ST|Cave|link}} and {{Plural|ST|Dungeon|link}}.

When they notice {{Term|SS|Link|link}}, they fly down to his level, and pause before attacking. Their distinctive yellow eyes will glow red just before they strike. {{Plural|SS|Keese}} can defeated with simple {{Term|SS|Sword|link}} strikes, as well as shot down from the sky using long-range weapons such as the {{Term|SS|Slingshot|link}}, {{Term|SS|Beetle|link}} and {{Term|SS|Bow|link}}.\n\n{{SS|-}} also features several other variations of {{Plural|SS|Keese}}, including {{Plural|SS|Fire Keese|link}} and two new forms: {{Plural|SS|Thunder Keese|link}} and {{Plural|SS|Dark Keese|link}}. {{Plural|SS|Thunder Keese}} are an electrified variant, whereas {{Plural|SS|Dark Keese}} are a skeletal variant that are able to {{Term|SS|Curse|link}} {{Term|SS|Link|link}}.\n\n==={{ALBW|-}}===\n{{Plural|ALBW|Keese}} in {{ALBW}} are closely based on their {{ALttP|-}} incarnation. They sit quietly, taking to the air only when approached. {{Plural|ALBW|Keese}} will generally make for {{Term|ALBW|Link|link}}'s direction as they fly. As before, any conventional weapon is able to dispel or otherwise stun them. If left alone, they will return to their original positions.\n\n==={{TFH|-}}===\n{{Plural|TFH|Keese}} in {{TFH}} behave similarly to their 3D console appearances. They patrol their territory in short, circular paths, yet when they spot one of the {{Plural|TFH|Link|link}}, they will back away before swiftly diving at them to attack. They can be defeated or stunned by any weapons in the {{Plural|TFH|Link}}' possession.\n\n{{Plural|TFH|Fire Keese|link|display=Fire}} and {{Plural|TFH|Ice Keese|link}} both appear in {{TFH|-}}.
