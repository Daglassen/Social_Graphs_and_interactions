Purportedly, a deadly curse had plagued the Von Bruinwalds for generations, when in reality, the first twelve barons were murdered by the ancestors of Hans and Helga.\n\nUpon learning that [[Baloo]] is the thirteenth baron of the Von Bruinwald line, the caretakers lure him away from [[Higher for Hire]] and to the castle with the promise of the wealth and luxury that awaits him. From the moment that he arrives, however, he finds constant attempts being made on his life. Arrows, a shark, and a giant swinging blade mark just a few of the deadly traps that he narrowly escapes.\n\nAfter learning how panicked Baloo is, [[Rebecca Cunningham]] travels to the castle along with [[Wildcat]]. While sneaking around, she overhears both Hans and Helga excitedly discussing how they will soon kill the final baron and inherit all that belongs to the Von Bruinwalds. Alerted to the eavesdropper, the duo attempt to roast Rebecca alive, but she is saved at the last moment by Baloo.\n\nUltimately, Hans and Helga are arrested when Austin Featheridge brings the police to the castle.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBalooestbluebloods.jpg\nHans and Helga - Talespin B.png\nHans and Helga - Talespin C.png\nHans and Helga - Talespin D.png|Hans and Helga's arrest\n</gallery>\n\n==  ==\n{{TaleSpin}}\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Badgers]]\n[[Category:Opossums]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
