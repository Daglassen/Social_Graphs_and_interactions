This article is about Naydra after being freed from Malice. For Naydra before being cured, see Malice Naydra.

Naydra is a Dragon in Breath of the Wild.


== Characteristics ==

Naydra is one of three roaming Dragons in Hyrule Kingdom, the others being Dinraal and Farosh. While it cannot be defeated, it does not actively try to harm Link. However, if Link gets too close, he will be frozen by the icy aura surrounding its body. Link can prevent being frozen by wearing either a full Snowquill Set that has been enhanced twice by a Great Fairy, or Zant's Helmet. Naydra will drop different Materials if Link shoots it with a Bow. Depending on what part of Naydra is hit, it will drop either a Shard of Naydra's Horn, Shard of Naydra's Fang, Naydra's Claw, or Naydra's Scale.
Naydra's Scale can be offered at the Spring of Wisdom to reveal the Jitan Sa'mi Shrine.


=== Location ===
Naydra, unlike the other dragons, does not roam Hyrule at first. It is first encountered as Malice Naydra at the Spring of Wisdom. After Link has purified Naydra of the Malice, Naydra roams the Lanayru and East Necluda Regions. However, Naydra will not appear if Link is too close to its spawn point.
