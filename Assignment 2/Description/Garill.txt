Each day, he goes to observe the ruins of Fort Hateno.<ref>{{Cite|Check out this angle!|Garill|BotW}}</ref> When {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} first encounters him, he mentions paying respects to the soldiers who lost their lives defending the Fort in the {{Term|BotW|Great Calamity|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Hiya! My name's Garill. Come to see {{Color|BotW Blue|Fort Hateno}}, I take it? [That's right.] Figured as much. It's well worth seeing! {{Color|BotW Blue|Fort Hateno}} here was the last line of defense between Hateno Village and the awful tragedy all those years ago. Everyone's got to come and pay their respects at least once in life, right?|Garill|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen prompted, Garill teaches Link about a Hylian [[Champion]].<ref>{{Cite|Do you know the story of the warrior who fought here at {{Color|BotW Blue|Fort Hateno}}?|Garill|BotW}}</ref> He explains that 100 years ago, there were a group of warriors known as the Champions, and while one fought at the Fort, the others perished in battle.<ref>{{Cite|[No, tell me.] So 100 years ago, we had these special warriors called Champions. The warrior who fought here was supposedly one of them. I heard the others all died in the big fight.|Garill|BotW}}</ref> With the other soldiers, he managed to hold back the onslaught of {{Plural|BotW|Guardian|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|<ref>{{Cite|Almost hard to believe they managed to hold back a whole horde of Guardians here.|Garill|BotW}}</ref> He also shares a rumor that the Champion was mortally wounded and taken to be revitalized to fight again after a long slumber and wonders if he'll be around for the day he wakes up.<ref>{{Cite|The warrior, though... Some say he gave his life here too. But others think he went into a deep sleep to prepare to fight another day. Which would mean he's still alive, right? I wonder if I'll still be around when he wakes up. I'd love to meet the guy.|Garill|BotW}}</ref>\n\nGarill is struck by the tragedy at Fort Hateno when he sees the ruins and is boggled by how many Guardians there are.<ref>{{Cite|The more I see of this place, the more it hits me just how hard the old tragedy struck here. But even knowing that, seeing so many Guardians... It boggles the mind.|Garill|BotW}}</ref> He reasons that the Champion must have been a great threat to the forces of darkness.<ref>{{Cite|That warrior must have been some threat to the forces of darkness, huh?|Garill|BotW}}</ref> He attributes the existence of {{Term|BotW|Hateno Village|link}}, and by extension his own life, to the sacrifices made at Fort Hateno and vows to pass this knowledge on.<ref>{{Cite|If not for {{Color|BotW Blue|Fort Hateno}} and the warrior, there'd be no such place as {{Color|BotW Blue|Hateno Village}} anymore.|Garill|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|The warrior and his soldiers at {{Color|BotW Blue|Fort Hateno}} risked their lives to protect the world. I wasn't there at the time, but I'm alive now because of them, and I've got to make sure future generations know it!|Garill|BotW}}</ref>\n\nGarill fancies the idea that he would have fought alongside the Hylian Champion if he were present during the Great Calamity,<ref>{{Cite|If I'd been alive 100 years ago...I like to think I'd have fought these Guardians here, right at the warrior's side.|Garill|BotW}}</ref> and expresses wonder at the Champion's skill to have been capable of felling the {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Stalker|link}}. attacking the Fort.<ref>{{Cite|The more I see of this place, the more it hits me just how hard the old tragedy struck here. But even knowing that, seeing so many Guardians... It boggles the mind. That warrior must have been some threat to the forces of darkness, huh?|Garill|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link wakes Garill up at night, he says that while he'd love to keep talking with him, he's observing a moment of silence for everyone who fought against the Guardians.<ref>{{Cite|I'd love to keep jawing with you about {{Color|BotW Blue|Fort Hateno}} and the warrior\u2014don't get me wrong. But I'm observing a moment of silence for the warrior and his troops who fought to the last against the Guardians.|Garill|BotW}}</ref> He tells Link that they can continue speaking in the morning.<ref>{{Cite|We can pick it up again in the morning.|Garill|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Hylian|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Fort Hateno|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
