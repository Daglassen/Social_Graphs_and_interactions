Luckily, [[Kion]] is able to save his friend by using The [[Roar of the Elders]], which shocks the two hyenas, giving Bunga time to escape.\n\nLater, Cheezi and the other hyenas learn from [[Mzingo]] that Kion is assembling a Lion Guard to protect The [[Pride Lands]] to which Janja declares that the clan will attack The Pride Lands that night.\n\nCheezi accompanies Janja and the rest of the clan when they attack a gazelle herd and cause a stampede, which Kion's older sister [[Kiara]] gets trapped in.

Before the team can reach the hyenas, the clan runs into Kion's mother, Nala, who orders Janja to return to his territory.\n\nInstead of heeding Nala's warning, Janja surrounds her with his cronies and orders an attack. Just then, Kion arrives and, seeing his mother in danger, uses the [[Roar of the Elders]] in a rage. The blast is so powerful that it knocks the hyenas back into the Outlands.\n\n===\"[[Ono's Idol]]\"===\nWhile out flying with his idol Hadithi, Ono spots a group of klipspringers being trapped on the edge of a cliff by Janja and his minions, Cheezi and Chungu. He suggests that they use the Hadithi Spin to thwart the hyenas, but Hadithi argues that Ono is not ready for such a feat. He then takes off for the ceremony, leaving Ono behind to deal with the crisis.\n\nOn his own, Ono attempts to stop the hyenas using the Hadithi Spin, but falls and gets his wing trapped beneath a boulder. Cheezi and Chungu hungrily climb up the cliffs to reach him, while Janja rounds up the trapped klipspringers.\n\nHowever, before the hyenas can hurt Ono, Hadithi returns with the Lion Guard, and Fuli fends off Cheezi and Chungu. Meanwhile, Bunga and Kion confront Janja, while Beshte pushes a boulder down for the klipspringers to use as an escape. As Fuli guides the klipspringers to safety, one slips and falls, prompting Janja and his minions to spring an attack.
