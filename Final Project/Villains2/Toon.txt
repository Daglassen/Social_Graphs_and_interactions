"{{Dablink|cartoon characters in general|the [[Stitch!]] experiment|[[Toons]]}}\n[[File:Tumblr nfnyantlt11qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg|250px|thumb]]\n{{Quote|All cartoon characters and fables must be exaggeration, caricatures. It is the very nature of fantasy and fable.|[[Walt Disney]]}}\nA \"'''Toon'''\" (abbreviation of '''Cartoon Character''') is simply an animated character or creature. In ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', they are presented as sentient beings who, notably, can physically occupy space and interact ''outside'' of their animated universe and into, say, the real world. All toons, no matter the company of their creation, come from a universe in the {{WikipediaLink|Multiverse}} known as the \"Tooniverse.\" One way to get there is through entering [[Toontown (Who Framed Roger Rabbit)|Toontown]], an animated metropolis/mega city adjacent to [[Los Angeles]] where most toons live.\n\nAll toons were once put in danger long ago when [[Judge Doom]] (a crazy, genocidal toon disguised as a real human) planned on destroying Toontown (by using the [[Dip]]) for commercial trade and a proposed [[Wikipedia:Controlled-access highway|freeway]]. All toons were almost completely wiped out until Doom's plans were foiled by [[Eddie Valiant]], along with [[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica]] and [[Roger Rabbit]].\n\n==Background==\nMost toons tend to have exaggerated, usually anthropomorphic, appearances and characteristics based on real animals or objects. Toons can be humans, realistic humans, anthropomorphic animals, realistic animals, robots, objects, anthropomorphic objects, extraterrestrial creatures, mythical beings, and other unidentified, newly-imagined creatures, monsters, or abstract, surreal characters. Their appearances can range from grossly caricatured with odd physical features (e.g., four-fingered hands, floating eyes, and/or eyebrows, etc.) to extremely realistic.\n\nAlmost all toons (depending on their personality) have an innate sense of comedic and/or dramatic timing. Most toons also have (also depending on their personality) an intense focus on a single-minded goal, such as hunting, catching prey, having selfish needs, being hungry, or capturing the object of one's romantic feelings; generally with comedic and/or dramatic results.\n\nThere's also the idea of two species of Toon (with the exception of their wide variety of appearances and characteristics). Eastern Toons from Anime that originated in Japan, Korea and China, and Western Toons from cartoons that originated in the USA and Europe. Inside these two are three subspecies, Comic (toons that often perform funny and comical acts but rarely performs sad ones), Tragic (toons that often perform sorrowful and serious acts in stories but rarely performs lighthearted ones), and Drama (toons that often perform both comedic and dramatic antics). For example, Nickelodeon\u2019s SpongeBob SquarePants is a Western comic Toon, Walt Disney\u2019s Mickey and Minnie Mouse are Western dramatic Toons, and Ken Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul is a Eastern tragic Toon.\n\nBecause of their inter-dimensional origins, most toons possess amusing abilities that contradict laws of physics in the real world; usually disregarding the physical laws that govern the real universe when traveling inside the real world (and a reciprocal disregard of those laws for them). Toons can also accomplish feats and possess powers (e.g., 4th Wall Awareness, Accelerated Metabolism, Deflation/Inflation, Invulnerability, Reality Warping, Teleportation, etc.) which were impossible for anything or anyone in the real world to imitate. All toons are also completely immune and nearly indestructible to any serious injury (e.g., being [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px0Rt0LwUAo crushed], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lsjJNS_Ogw shot with bullets], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBWUVl2oSHk decapitated], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAL_nQj4w8A turned to stone] ([https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Slowwww_Going#Episode%201-20at least] [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Grounder_the_Genius#Episode%2021-40 not for very long]), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqB0lwt8EQw eviscerated] (at least not for very long), stabbed (for long periods), suffer from blood or energy loss (that is, they can regenerate their blood or life force ''after'' it is taken from them), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id58xR4gIVs frozen] or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toHy5Je64EU burned], stretched, etc.). Therefore, Toon flesh has the capability to heal from these injuries at a much faster rate than humans suffering from them. The mechanics of the Tooniverse and their way of life are based entirely on comedy, drama and tragedy; nearly ''anything'' can happen only as long as it's humorous, dramatic or serious in some way. The color of Toon blood is also a mystery.\n\nToons are also capable of moving at super speed, as shown with Mickey in the short [[Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip]] and the ''Mickey to the Rescue'' short \"[[Cages and Cannons]]\".\n\nThis is especially seen in animated characters (that are not Disney) like ''{{WikipediaLink|Looney Tunes}}'', ''{{WikipediaLink|Tom and Jerry}}'', or the ''{{WikipediaLink|Tex Avery}}'' cartoons. However, toons use these unique abilities to entertain humans in the real world. The only (known) way to permanently kill a Toon is to dip it in \"[[Dip]],\" because the chemicals that make up Dip are paint thinners (though Eddie Valiant defeated most of [[The Toon Patrol|Doom's weasels]] by making them laugh to death with a vaudeville comedy act).\n\nToons (at least ones like Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Goofy amongst others) also never age, no matter how long their cartoons last. Many long-running theatrical shorts, television series, and comic strips often feature characters in both present day and moments of history. And in both examples, they don't appear to age. It is said that whenever certain animated characters appear to age according to time, there exist different versions of that character playing the part of that particular age, though this is not proven very clearly. Toons also don't appear to suffer from many of our world's diseases and illnesses unless the script calls for it. They can also change their height and muscular structure to adapt to any particular situation. As [[Goofy]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] have demonstrated (with them being in relationships and with children of their own), toons can also procreate if they so choose. Thanks to something called \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_hose_animation rubberhose animation]\", the muscular system of most Toons is really rubbery and stretchy, enabling them to, say, reach for things at great distances and perform more complex gymnastics and martial arts techniques that most humans cannot perform. In addition, it is implied that Toons have the ability to shape shift, at least into different versions of themselves, as Tweety is shown in both his classic design from the 1940s in one Toontown scene and reappears in his modern design in the final scene at the [[Acme Corporation]] gag factory.\n\nSome toons also have the ability to produce certain things to show their feelings and emotions (e.g., hearts floating over heads or eyes forming into hearts when in love, explosions in eye pupils and/or steam shooting out of ears when angry, stars or birds orbiting heads whenever dizzy and/or in a daze, etc.). It is not confirmed how this is possible but it is speculated that, in some instances, they can do so with a mere thought. Comic strips and comic books are produced by photographing toon characters that speak in word balloons, which appear above their heads whenever they talk.\n\nIf we believe the original film, with the exception of the [[List of cameos in Who Framed Roger Rabbit|characters appearing in or created specifically for]] ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', all animated/cartoon characters ever created (ranging from the early 1900s to the 2000s and beyond) are Toons. However, lots of films and comics seem to contradict this idea.{{fact}}\n\n===Development===\nThe origin of the word probably was started by the name of the ''{{WikipediaLink|Looney Tunes}}'' series of animated shorts by {{WikipediaLink|Warner Brothers}} (though the spelling is different). It was first used in the [[1981]] {{WikipediaLink|Gary K. Wolf}} novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'' and its film adaptation ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. These two works created and established the Toon Noir sub-genre, which features toons and non-toon humans living together, each playing by their own set of physics.\n\nThe small sub-genre also includes [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', ''[[Bonkers]]'', and ''[[House of Mouse]]'' and Warner Brothers' ''{{WikipediaLink|Tiny Toon Adventures}}'', ''{{WikipediaLink|Animaniacs}}'', and ''{{WikipediaLink|Freakazoid}}'' cartoon series and the films ''{{WikipediaLink|Space Jam}}'' ([[1996]]), ''{{WikipediaLink|The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle}}'' ([[2000]]) and ''{{WikipediaLink|Looney Tunes: Back in Action}}'' ([[2003]]), and also the video games ''[[Wikipedia:Toon (role-playing game)|Toon]]'', ''{{WikipediaLink|Go! Go! Hypergrind}}'', ''{{WikipediaLink|Toonstruck}}'', and the MMORPG ''[[Toontown Online]]''. The video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' is supposedly set in a world resembling the world of ''Bonkers'' and the ''House of Mouse'', but no human is seen during the game, so it can't be classified as a Toon Noir game ''stricto sensu''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Toontown]]\n*''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''\n*[[Mickey's Toontown]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/ Toonopedia entry on ''Toons'']\n\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n[[es:Los Dibus]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Toontown characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Empire 50 Best Animated Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Articles with Wikipedia content]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n{{Toontown Online}}"
