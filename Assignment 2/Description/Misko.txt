[[Link]] never meets or sees Misko and only learns about them through information about their treasure. When Link tries to talk to [[Prissen]] and [[Domidak]] at the [[Dueling Peaks Stable]], they will be discussing a lead on Misko's treasure,<ref>{{Cite|I've got the scoop on Misko's {{Color|BotW Red|treasure}}, and it's great! Listen up, Dak...|Prissen|BotW}}</ref> before stopping when they notice Link.<ref>{{Cite|Prissen! Hang on! Hey, buddy! What's your problem? You aren't being incredibly rude and listening to our conversation, are you?|Domidak|BotW}}</ref> If Link persists on discussing the treasure, Domidak will confirm they are looking for Misko's treasure but will not tell Link about the lead for free.<ref>{{Cite|We're after nothing less than the {{Color|BotW Red|treasure of Misko, the Great Bandit}}! Finding it would mean incredible riches... I'm not about to give this information away for free. I'm no fool!|Domidak|BotW}}</ref> If Link pays the 100 [[Rupee]]s that Domidak asks for, he will state a riddle.<ref>{{Cite|The little twin steps over the little river. My cave rests above that river's source.|Domidak|BotW}}</ref> Domidak explains that Misko hid the location of the treasure using a riddle and mentions that the person he had heard the riddle from can eventually be linked to an underling of Misko.<ref>{{Cite|Misko hid the location of the treasure in some kind of strange secret code. I heard this from a former dog walker of one of Misko's underling's descendant's neighbors. As solid a lead as any.|Domidak|BotW}}</ref> Learning the riddle begins the [[Side Quest]] \"[[Misko, the Great Bandit]]\".\n\nIf [[The Master Trials]] DLC is installed, [[Misko's EX Journal]] will appear in the [[Outpost Ruins]]. The journal was written by Misko to note down the locations of eight [[Treasure Chest]]s containing priceless relics that they stole from [[Hyrule Castle (Breath of the Wild)|Hyrule Castle]].<ref>{{Cite|I hid the eight priceless relics I stole from Hyrule Castle in treasure chests... I shall write down their locations. -{{Color|BotW Blue|Misko}}|Misko's EX Journal|BotW}}</ref> Obtaining the stolen relics is the goal of four Side Quests: \"[[EX Treasure: Ancient Mask]]\", \"[[EX Treasure: Fairy Clothes]]\", \"[[EX Treasure: Twilight Relic]]\", and \"[[EX Treasure: Phantasma]]\".\n\nIf [[The Champions' Ballad]] DLC is installed, [[Misko's EX Journal 2]] will appear in the [[Deya Village Ruins]]. In the Journal, Misko wrote down clues to where they had hidden six Chests containing priceless relics that they had stolen from Hyrule Castle.<ref>{{Cite|I hid the six priceless relics I stole from Hyrule Castle in treasure chests... I shall write down their locations. -{{Color|BotW Blue|Misko}}|Misko's EX Journal 2|BotW}}</ref> Retrieving the relics that Misko stole is the goal of four Side Quests: \"[[EX Treasure: Merchant Hood]]\", \"[[EX Treasure: Garb of Winds]]\", \"[[EX Treasure: Usurper King]]\", and \"[[EX Treasure: Dark Armor]]\".\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Names\n|align= left\n|enBr= \n|enBrM= \n|ja= {{Romanize|\u30e9\u30e0\u30c0|Ramuda}}\n|jaM= \n|zhS= \n|zhSM= \n|zhT= \n|zhTM= \n|nl= \n|nlM= \n|fi= \n|fiM= \n|frC= \n|frCM= \n|frF= Lambda\n|frFM= \n|de= Ramda\n|deM= \n|hu= \n|huM= \n|it= \n|itM= \n|ko= \n|koM= \n|no= \n|noM= \n|pl= \n|plM= \n|ptB= \n|ptBM= \n|ptP= \n|ptPM= \n|ru= \n|ruM= \n|esS= \n|esSM= \n|esL= \n|esLM= }}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Misko's EX Journal]]\n* [[Misko's EX Journal 2]]\n* [[Misko, the Great Bandit]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
