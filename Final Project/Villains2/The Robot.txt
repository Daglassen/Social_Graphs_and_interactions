"{{Infobox character\n|image = The Robot.jpg\n|films = ''[[Sky High]]''\n|alignment = Bad\n|weapons = Pincher, Serrated Sphere Hand\n|fate = Destroyed}}\n'''The Robot''' is a minor villain featured in the live-action film, ''[[Sky High]]''.\n==History==\nThe Robot was created by [[Royal Pain]] to wreak havoc on the city. Unbeknownst to everyone, the real reason it was created was to trick [[The Commander]] and [[Jetstream]] in destroying it. Royal Pain knew that the commander likes to keep tropies of his victories, so\u00a0she designed the eye to be a camera so she could spy on The Commander and Jetstream. Jetstream hurled the Commander's powerful body into the robot, toppling it.\n\nAfter the robot died, the Commander took the eye to his secret lair where she discovered that he was keeping her old weapon, [[The Pacifier (Sky High)|the Pacifier]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"left\">\nThe Robot Head.jpg\nThe Robot attack.jpg\nThe Robot Destroyed.jpg\nThe Robot Eye.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sky High}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robot, The}}\n[[Category:Sky High characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Sky High]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Sky High objects]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
