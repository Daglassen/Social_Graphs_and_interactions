Treasure Octoroks are recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Treasure Octoroks are a type of Octorok that lives in sandy and snowy areas. They bury themselves in the sand or snow disguised as a buried Treasure Chest, jumping out if close enough. They then burrow back into the ground, digging away from Link. Their Treasure Chests are not magnetic, therefore, they cannot be pulled out with the Magnesis Rune. If struck with a Remote Bomb, they will pop out of the ground confused, leaving themselves open for an attack. When defeated, Treasure Octoroks leave behind several Rupees alongside their spoils.
