Studios)|The Incredibles comic book series]] by [[Boom! Studios]]. She is a member of the Confederacy of Crime and eventually the [[Unforgivables]].\n\n\n==Appearances==\n===The Incredibles comic book===\nRollergrrl is one of the many confederacy members called in to retrieve the Alien Superpower Virus from the lab of Doc Sunbright. She actually gets a hold of the canister, but is attacked by [[Dash Parr|Dash]]\u00a0and eventually put into a forcefield by [[Violet Parr|Violet]]. About two years later, after the events of [[The Incredibles|the film]], Rollergrrl and her fellow Confederacy members are still active, though their team has generally been falling apart. Going after [[Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]], who carries the virus now, the Confederacy of Crime has the key to power enhancement in their grasp, but the treachery of Shifty ends up causing them to lose the virus and the battle. Rollergrrl would be one of the members of the team to escape the NSA authorities and would join up as a member of the Unforgivables, being formed by [[Xerek]], afterwards.\n{{Incredibles}}\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The Incredibles characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]"
