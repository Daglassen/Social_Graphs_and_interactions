However, Pryde later swears the First Order's allegiance to [[Palpatine]] serving as commanding officer of the [[Sith Eternal]]'s fleet, the Final Order, at the Battle of [[Exegol]]. \n\nHowever, before he can leave Exegol with the Sith fleet, the [[Resistance]] as well as many other citizens of the galaxy join forces to attack and destroy the Sith Eternal forces. As the resistance members manage to destroy his signal tower, his technology suffers a blackout and his starship eventually collapses, killing him in the explosion.\n\n== Personality ==\nPryde is a calm yet highly intelligent and ruthless general, as he was quick to identify General Hux's betrayal as the spy against the First Order and executed him on the spot without hesitation. He is also fanatically loyal to Emperor Palpatine, having served him back during the days of the old [[Galactic Empire]], and followed his commands without question.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Fans thought Richard E. Grant would play [[Thrawn]] in ''Rise of Skywalker'' because of his appearance being similar to Thrawn until Pryde's name was revealed.\n*To get the role of Pryde, Richard E. Grant had to act scenes from \"a 40s British war film\" in his audition before he was notified months later that he had get the role. On the other hand, Grant based his performance as Pryde on the legendary Peter Cushing's portrayal as [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] in ''Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nStar Wars The Rise of Skywalker - Photography - Generala Hux and Allegiant General Pryde.jpg\nThe First Order and Kylo.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-2226.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-2297.jpg|Pryde saying the Sith Eternal will increase the First Order's power.\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-2305.jpg|\"Such range in power will correct the error of [[Starkiller Base]].\"\nKylo finds out where Rey is.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-2798.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-4923.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-4964.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-5860.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-6700.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-7733.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-7742.jpg|\"Tell him we found our spy.\"\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-10249.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-10260.jpg|\"As I served you in the old wars, I serve you now.\"\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-11775.jpg|\"Use ion cannons!\"\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-11982.jpg\nSwrise-starwarsscreencaps.com-13585.jpg|\"Where did they get all these fighter craft?
