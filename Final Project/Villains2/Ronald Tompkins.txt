'''Ron the Manager''')\u00a0is the main antagonist of the [[2013]] [[Pixar]] TV special\u00a0''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''===\nRon is the manager of the [[Sleep Well]] motel. He has an anxious personality, with a tendency to laugh nervously. He loves iguanas, as evidenced by his eBid username, iguanaluvr75, and the fact that he owns one. He\u00a0steals toys and other objects from his customers using his pet iguana\u00a0[[Mr. Jones]] to take them, and sells them on the Internet. When [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], [[Jessie]], [[Mr. Pricklepants]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], [[Rex]], and [[Trixie]] were captured, he also had several other toys in his possession. Ron was thrilled to get high winning bids for Woody and Jessie, and proceeded to pack them up for shipment. However, they both escaped, and Jessie exposed his scheme, revealing to [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] her toys were in the manager's possession. When he was caught with Bonnie's toys, [[Mrs. Anderson|Bonnie's mother]]\u00a0became so furious\u00a0at him and said that she should call the police.\n\nDuring the credits, two policemen arrived, asking him if he was the manager. Panicking, Ron nervously assured them he wasn't, said he would go get the manager, and disappeared into his office.\u00a0He ran out the back door and attempted to hijack the patrol car.\u00a0However, in his panic, he failed to escape, and not looking exactly where he was going, backed into his motel's sign, which fell on the car. He left the smashed patrol car and ran off, as an officer simply alerted the police that\u00a0they \"got a runner.\"\n\n===Deleted Scenes===\nThe team thought it was important to explain Ron's motivation to steal, but all scenes pertaining to this were finally cut. These would have revealed Ron was \"raising money\" to get a dream boat from Bob's Boatyard, his neighbor. The sales of Woody and Jessie finally bring him enough money, and he immediately goes on to order the boat. In an alternate ending, it is towed to Ron precisely as he is arrested. Upon seeing this, the driver freaks out and drives backwards in a hurry, and accidentally gets the boat smashed to pieces by a passing truck, much to Ron's dismay.<ref>[http://www.disneymoviesanywhere.com/discover/pixar-toy-story-terror-extras-deleted-scenes \"Toy Story of Terror: Deleted Scenes\" on Disney Movies Anywhere]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nPixar Post - Bob's Boat Yard from Toy Story of TERROR.png|Ron in a deleted scene\nWatch Toy Story of Terror (2013) Online for Free - Viooz.jpg|Ron's escape and defeat.\nRon (Toy Story).png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ron is similar\u00a0to [[Al McWhiggin]]\u00a0from ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' for stealing toys and selling them.\n*It\u00a0was never revealed if Ron was arrested for stealing. Though it's most likely he would be, given to his guilt as he attempted to run away from the officers.\n*Ron has a cup that reads: \"Here Comes Trouble\", hinting\u00a0that he is the villain.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{PixarWiki|Ron the Manager}}\n{{Toy Story}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tompkins, Ronald}}\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]"
