M'sieur Le Sewer) is a French weasel thief and Ratatouille is a French rat thief and a talented painter. Something that can be viewed as kind of odd is when Ratatouille comments on his hatred of rodents. Le Sewer remarks that he is a rodent himself. Ratatouille disagrees and proudly states that he is not a rodent but an artist.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Le Sewer is a\u00a0parody referring to the sewers.\n*Ratatouille was named after [[Ratatouille (food)|a French recipe]]. It is also, coincidentally, the title of a Pixar film.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Weasels]]\n[[Category:Rats]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
