She has a yellow number tag on her lower right ear. Bessie has tan spots and a light cream body. The hair on the top of her head is slightly darker then her spots.\n\n== Personality ==\nBessie appears to be a harmless, sweet, and simple local, but is actually smart and devious. Bessie is shown to be one not to mess with, which [[Dylan]] and [[Dante (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dante]] found out the hard way.\u00a0She also wants to kill the\u00a0Dalmatian family,\u00a0believing them to be annoying city dwellers, only to fail miserably.\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Cows]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]"
