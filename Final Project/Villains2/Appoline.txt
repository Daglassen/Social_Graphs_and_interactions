She is a French poodle as well as [[Colleen Mansfield]]'s pet.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]] ''===\nIn the beginning, Appoline is seen being accidentally covered in dirt by [[Papi]] and [[Chloe]]'s puppies. Chloe tries to tell her that they're just puppies, but she doesn't care. She has a French accent, but Chloe states she is actually from the Valley, although she denies it. Appoline is revealed to have won the dog show for a third year in a row. She and Colleen are seen walking away after the conflict.\u00a0Later, at the Beverly Hills dog show, Appoline is competing again for the fourth win. Her talent is paw-painting and makes a painting of a first-place trophy. In the end, due to Papi's lack of breeding papers, Appoline wins by default. \n\nAfterwards, she and [[Colleen Mansfield]] are not seen again, but she is shown singing ''Chihuahua'' along with everyone else in the credits.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nVlcsnap-2015-08-14-13h06m14s137.png\n011BHC Elaine Hendrix 005.jpg\nVlcsnap-2015-08-14-13h11m09s377.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the trailer, she was the only villain that was actually talking.\n{{Beverly Hills Chihuahua}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Beverly Hills Chihuahua characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
