This article is about the Deku Tree itself. For the eponymous Dungeon in Ocarina of Time, see Inside the Deku Tree.

The Great Deku Tree,(BotW) also simply referred as the Great Deku Tree(OoT | TWW) or Deku Tree,(NL) is the fatherly guardian of the forest who safeguards not only the dense land around him, but the small population of beings that live in his shadow. In Ocarina of Time, the Kokiri praise and worship the massive tree, sharing a home in the Kokiri Forest, while in The Wind Waker, these beings are the Koroks, timid wood creatures who live collaboratively with the talking tree in the Forest Haven.


== Biography ==


=== Ocarina of Time ===
In Ocarina of Time, the Deku Tree is the guardian of the Kokiri and of their forest. He protects the Kokiri's Emerald, one of the three Spiritual Stones.
At the beginning of the game, the Deku Tree sends Navi the Fairy to summon Link to him, explaining to the young boy that he has been cursed by Ganondorf. Link is asked to journey Inside the Deku Tree, the first dungeon of the game, and destroy the root of the curse, the parasite known as Queen Gohma. Afterwards, the Great Deku Tree details Ganondorf's motives, the Golden Goddesses, and the Triforce they created. The Deku Tree withers and dies soon after due to the effects of the curse. Before passing on, he tasks Link with saving all of Hyrule from Ganondorf, directing him to meet Princess Zelda at Hyrule Castle outside the forest, and entrusting him with the Kokiri's Emerald.
When Link returns to Kokiri Forest seven years later as an adult, he finds that it has been overrun by monsters due to the Deku Tree's absence. After clearing the Forest Temple and awakening Saria as a Sage, the Deku Tree Sprout takes root in the ground before his predecessor, and the monsters plaguing the forest subsequently vanish.


=== The Wind Waker ===
The Great Deku Tree acts as the guardian of the Forest Haven, home of the Koroks, in The Wind Waker. To them, the Great Deku Tree is considered a father figure to the children of the forest, for it is him that protects them from evil. One thing that sets the Deku Tree of the Great Sea apart from his predecessor is that each year, he sends off some of the Koroks to plant Forest Trees throughout the islands. This is done in the hope that, as the forests spread and the trees grew, they will consolidate the remaining land above the Great Sea, and allow some of the land lost during the Great Flood to be reclaimed from the depths. It also rejuvenates his power, for if his power were to wane, the life of the Koroks would fade as well.
When Link first meets the Great Deku Tree, hordes of ChuChus are invading his face. After the young hero eliminates all of them, the Great Deku Tree mistakes him for the legendary Hero of Time due to his clothes, and begins to speak the ancient Hylian language. The Great Deku Tree realizes his error, and it is then that he realizes why Link is there: to receive Farore's Pearl from him. Just as the guardian of the forest is about to begin the annual Korok ceremony in order to give the pearl to Link, Linder informs the Great Deku Tree of Makar's accident, and the ceremony is called off. After Link rescues Makar from the depths of the Forbidden Woods with the help of the Deku Leaf given to him by the Great Deku Tree himself, the ceremony begins, and in return, the Great Deku Tree hands over Farore's Pearl, as promised.
Hyrule Historia states that this Deku Tree descended from his Ocarina of Time counterpart and the Encyclopedia explicitly identifies him as the grown-up Deku Tree Sprout.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

In Breath of the Wild, The Great Deku Tree lives deep within the Lost Woods, at the center of the Korok Forest. He watched over the Master Sword in its pedestal for 100 years prior to the events of Breath of the Wild. He informs Link of the dangers of pulling out the Master Sword without being strong enough. If Link fails to pull out the Master Sword, the Great Deku Tree belittles him, stating that Link has grown weak. 
Inside the Great Deku Tree's Navel, there are two shops, the General Shoppe and the Spore Store, as well as an Inn built for Link. Many Koroks live around, inside, and on top of him.
