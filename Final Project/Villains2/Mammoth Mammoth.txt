"[[File:Mammothmammoth.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Mammoth Mammoth''' is a small toon mammoth in the TV series ''[[Bonkers]]'' and appears as the main antagonist in the episode \"[[A Wooly Bully]]\". He is voiced by [[Stuart Pankin]].\n\nHe thinks he's a real superhero, when in reality he is just an actor who got too obsessed with his role and got fired because of it, and tried to fight crimes with his overbearing bravado with disastrous results.\n\n\n==Trivia==\nHe is similar to [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]], as he thinks he's a real superhero and not an actor while people around him tell him he's not, although unlike Bolt, the director of his show is one of those people.\n\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Bonkers}}\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
