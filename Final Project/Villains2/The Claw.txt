He is an extremely violent criminal named for the metal claw replacing his hand. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]],\u00a0in a tone\u00a0very similar to that of his character\u00a0[[Dr. Claw]] from the original ''[[Inspector Gadget]]'' cartoon.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThe Claw first appears in \"[[Ready, Aim... Duck!]]\" when [[Donald Duck|Donald]] claims that he was responsible for breaking [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews']] video game console (in reality, Donald himself was the one who broke it). This causes The Claw to seek out Donald in anger.\n\nIn his second appearance, \"[[Long Arm of the Claw]]\", The Claw reappears as a fully rehabilitated \"good citizen.\" However, he relapses back into his violent nature whenever he sees gold and calms down only when he hears the sound of a ringing bell.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''[[Long Arm of the Claw]]'', a scene showing him going backwards and forwards into relapsing as him running up to a mountain and waving his arms similar to [[Chernabog]] in [[Fantasia]], then he hears a bell and cowers like Chernabog did.\n*In ''[[Long Arm of the Claw]]'', he is very similar to [[Comet Guy]] from ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' as he has super strength and every time he hears a bell he does something peaceful, there's even a scene where he keeps hearing bells and going backwards and forwards into relapsing.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nThe claw.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Quack Pack}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Claw, The}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
