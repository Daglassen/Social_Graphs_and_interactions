== Biography ==
Lorn is a Gerudo merchant who manages a Lorn's Fruit Stand in Gerudo Town. She sells a variety of fruit at her stall. If Link speaks to Lorn, she claims that her fruit is fresh, juicy and perfect for eating. The Gerudo child Dalia can be found sleeping at her Shop during the night, suggesting that Dalia is Lorn's daughter. Lorn tells Link that her child loves Fruitcake, but says that it is difficult to find the Tabantha Wheat, Cane Sugar and Goat Butter needed to cook it. Lorn suggests that Link makes Fruitcake himself sometime. If Link sells items to Lorn, she comments that it is fun to see what foreigners carry with them into Gerudo Town and tells him show her more sometime.
