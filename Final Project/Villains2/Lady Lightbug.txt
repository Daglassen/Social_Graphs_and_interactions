It is shown that she stole the West River bridge and took it to her hideout at an old abandoned carnival. At the carnival, Lightbug emerges from an abandoned funhouse where she attacks the heroes, much to their shock. Planning to steal other bridges and creating massive traffic jams, causing the economies of the free world to collapse with it's citizens unable to commute to work, Lightbug then traps Frozone with her radioactive silk to which Mr. Incredible tries to stop her with the abandoned Ferris wheel he picked up but she ultimately dodges it. Riding on a rollercoaster, Mr. Incredible tackles her as she ends up trapped in a jar placed on the West River Bridge. Lightbug is last seen defeated as a plan to take revenge against superheroes.\n\nIn the optional commentary recorded by the real [[Lucius Best|Frozone]] and Mr. Incredible, it was noted that Lady Lightbug was a villain made up for the cartoon and does not really exist in ''[[The Incredibles]]''. She was also depicted as a Communist for propaganda purposes.\n\n{{The Incredibles}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lightbug, Lady}}\n[[Category:The Incredibles characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]"
