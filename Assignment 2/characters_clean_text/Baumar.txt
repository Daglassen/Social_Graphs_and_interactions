Baumar is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Baumar is a Hylian who travels with his Horse, Bamboo, while carrying a Fisherman's Shield and a Traveler's Sword. The pair travel back and forth between Serenne Stable and Snowfield Stable.
When Baumar was a child, he almost got lost up in the Hebra Mountains. While a shield surfer saved him, Baumar has trouble recall his name. Falmark was the shield surfer, and he claims that surfing down the mountain with a child on his back was difficult.
Baumer shows a lot of appreciation for Bamboo. He refers to his Horse with a lot of affectionate terms, such as "totally gnarly", "radical", and "most excellent". He also offers directions as the two of them travel.
Baumar enjoys Shield Surfing, finding it difficult to go long times without doing so. He claims both to be talented and to climb the Hebra Mountains to surf. When he makes it to Snowfield Stable, Baumar is excited to head up the Hebra Mountains and finally go Shield Surfing.
If he's caught in the rain, he's disappointed that he can't shield surf.  While it's storming or snowing, Baumar wonders if professional shield surfers head out in this type of weather, confessing he'd break his neck if he wiped out.
Occasionally, Baumar will give Link a Shield Surfing tip. For example, depending on the type of Shield used, one's surfing will be different. He knows of a Shield that's supposed to be good for Shield Surfing, which is the Knight's Shield, but he can't remember what it's called. Additionally, he's heard of the Hylian Shield within Hyrule Castle.
There's a rumor Baumar has heard that Selmie, a legendary shield surfer, is waiting on the Hebra Mountains for a worthy opponent.
