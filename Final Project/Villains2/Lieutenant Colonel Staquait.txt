He is a vicious, scar-faced Colonel in the French Foreign Legion. He sees himself on the right side of the law, but his draconian means do not justify his actions, putting him at odds with [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''===\nIn \"[[Tarzan and the Fugitives]]\", Staquait acts as judge and executioner, and has made it his goal to hunt down Hugo and Hooft, after they refused his order to burn down a village full of women and children. Tarzan helps fake their demise, but the Colonel eventually learns the truth and imprisons them in \"Tarzan and the Prison Break\". Tarzan ends up imprisoned in Cape Doom as well, then after allowing Hugo and Hoof to escape, is sentenced to hang. However, Tarzan is released after [[Renard Dumont|Renard]] impersonates a French magistrate, which Staquait does not notice as the heroes safely return to [[Africa]] by steamship.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Staquait seems to have the same facial traits as [[Jafar]] from Aladdin.\n* Staquait's the second villain with a scar on his eye. The first one was [[Scar]]. However, Staquait's scar is on his right eye while Scar's is on the left.\n* Staquait is similar to [[Claude Frollo]] because both believe they're doing what's right even trying to burn down a village of innocent people.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\n808px-Securedownload5.png\nStaquaittarzantheme.jpg|Lt.
