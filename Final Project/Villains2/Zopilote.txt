He also finds delight when those he mentors become evil, as when he learned that Ash stole his tamborita, he wasn\u2019t angry with her and was instead proud of his student\u2019s maliciousness, though he was disappointed in her irresponsibility when she broke it.\n\n==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==\nWhen Ash was a young girl, Zopilote invaded her village and stole whatever he wanted, including her two pet mice. This act caused Ash to believe that only wicked people win, so she sought Zopilote as her mentor, and for 10 years he taught her dark magic.\n\nIn \u201c[[Sister of Invention]]\u201d, [[Ash Delgado|Ash]] and\u00a0[[Carla Delgado|Carla]]\u00a0go to him in order to get new [https://elenaofavalor.fandom.com/wiki/Tamborita tamboritas]. As he only has one spare, he gives it to Carla after taking a liking to her rude personality but offers Ash something more valuable: a puzzle map to [[Takaina]]. Not long after he leaves, Ash steals his tamborita.\n\nIn \u201c[[Captain Mateo]]\u201d, Ash and Esteban go to him and Ash begs for forgiveness for stealing his tamborita, though Zopilote instead expresses pride at his prized student\u2019s malice act. He is unimpressed when Ash informs him that it got destroyed, but regardless decides to teach Esteban, who he learns got the magic of Takaina, how to use his new powers, on the condition that Ash remember that he is the master.\n\nIn \u201c[[Dreamcatcher (Elena of Avalor)|Dreamcatcher\u201d]], Zopilote continues training Esteban on how to use his new powers but becomes frustrated at his reluctance. He realizes that Esteban doesn\u2019t like his new life and desires to return to the palace, but he informs him that the only thing waiting for him there is a princess who wants to banish him to a deserted island.\n\nIn \u201c[[Spirit of a Wizard]]\u201d, after Esteban masters his teleportation powers, he informs him and Ash that the entrance to Takaina was sealed shut by enchanted crystals from Princess Elena\u2019s scepter. The three decide to steal her scepter and formulate a plan to ambush her and the others. When Esteban uses his powers to find them, Zopilote learns that Alacazar is with them and reveals that he has a history with him. During the ambush, Zopilote attempts to kill Mateo only for Alacazar to take the blast instead. Though they succeeded briefly in getting the scepter, Elena eventually manages to get it back with Mateo\u2019s help and Zopilote winds up being turned into a tiny yellow bird by him.\n\nIn \"[[Coronation Day]]\", it is revealed that Zopilote had since been eaten. As a green spirit in the [[Spirit World]], he is recruited by Ash into joining her olaball team, facing off against Elena, her parents, and [[Bobo]], so she can return to the living world. Though Ash does wind up winning, it turns out her \"reward\" is to stay in the Spirit World with Grand Macaw, and as she is escorted accordingly in spite of her protests and sobs, Zopilote does nothing to help her and comments to [[Orizaba]] she is his greatest disappointment.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nZopilote.jpg\nSpirit of a Wizard (2).jpg\nEoA CD Team Ash.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In his humanoid form, Zopilote resembles a harpy, but is male rather than female.\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
