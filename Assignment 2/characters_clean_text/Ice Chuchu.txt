Ice Chuchus,(ST | BotW) also known as Ice ChuChus,(ST)[name reference needed] are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Spirit Tracks ===
Ice Chuchus are white Chuchus that produce an icy mist in Spirit Tracks. They are native to the Snow Realm of Hyrule. Their mist prevents them from being attacked directly as it will freeze Link instantly, requiring the screen to be rubbed with the stylus to thaw him out. Like Yellow Chuchus, they can be stunned first to remove their defense mechanism, rendering them safe to attack.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Ice Chuchus appear in more frigid climates, such as Mount Hylia and the Hebra Mountains. They are lightweight and can be pushed about with bursts of wind from the Korok Leaf. If they touch Link, he becomes temporarily frozen. Ice Chuchus attack by dashing at Link and creating an icy blast around them. After attacking, Ice Chuchus temporarily lose their icy coating and are vulnerable to attack. If they are defeated while they have their icy exteriors, they will emit an icy blast, freezing anything in range. Ice Chuchus drop White Chuchu Jelly upon their defeat.
