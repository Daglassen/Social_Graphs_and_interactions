Her endless fascination with rare or dangerous droids makes her disregard anyone who might get in the way of obtaining her goal.\n\nDespite her darker traits, she's ironically a person who can see the brighter side in most situations, usually responding with some variation of a comedic retort.\n\nWhen she first meets [[Darth Vader]], she displays awkward and fanatical behavior around him, being a \"fan of his work\", although she later calms down when being in his presence.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Star Wars: Darth Vader''===\nAphra was born shortly before the Clone Wars began. When she was young, her Mother separated from Aphra's father, and she took her to live on the frontier, for a \"spiritual existence\" on a forest planet. During a crisis involving the Separatist Alliance, Raiders came to Aphra's home and killed her mother, whilst Aphra hid in a cave.\n\nBy the time of The Battle of Yavin, Aphra had obtained her doctorate in Droid Archaeology, and worked as a hired hand with those who would require her assistance in droid related matters. She also had a relationship with Sana Starros, the supposed wife of [[Han Solo]].\n\nShe was secretly hired by [[Darth Vader]] to build for him an army of [[Battle Droids]], so he could prove his worth to [[Palpatine|The Emperor]] after being upstaged by an Imperial doctor who genetically made lightsaber wielding warriors. In return, Vader activated two droids in Aphra's possession, ''0-0-0'' and ''BT-1'', both formerly imperial droids that were deactivated for their murderous personalities.\n\nAphra and the two droids would join Vader on his quest to find the\u00a0[[Luke Skywalker|pilot]] who flew the [[X-Wing]] that destroyed the [[Death Star]]. She would later enlist a group of Bounty Hunters to steal resources from the Empire, which of the team of hunters included the[[Wookiees| Wookiee]] bounty hunter, ''Black Krrsantan''. She was later captured by the [[Rebel Alliance]] during a confrontation between Luke Skywalker and [[Han Solo]], and was put in one of their prisons. While there, she reconnected with Sana Starros, and helped [[Leia Organa]] navigate through the jail when it had been taken over by a traitor to the rebellion.\n\nAfter the Rebel Jail incident, Aphra fled to a desolate planet, fearing what Vader's actions would be if he were to find out about the Rebel Jail. ''0-0-0'' and ''BT-1'', under orders from Vader, tracked down their old master, and brought Aphra back to Vader, just in time for his confrontation with Doctor Cylo, the Doctor who has pushed him out of his Imperial position.\n\nAfter Vader successfully defeated Cylo, he then went to dispose of Aphra, pushing her out of an airlock. Vader didn't find out that before she could die, a ship piloted by ''0-0-0'' caught her. Regaining consciousness, she set a new course for herself, her two droids, and the Wookiee Bounty Hunter who stuck around with her.\n\n===''Star Wars: Doctor Aphra''===\nAfter surviving her murder attempt from [[Darth Vader]], Aphra tried to pick up her life before meeting the Sith Lord, trying to make her way in the universe. Along with ''0-0-0'', ''BT-1'' and the Wookiee bounty hunter ''Black Krrsantan'', Aphra searched for rare artifacts and tried to avoid the [[Galactic Empire| Empire]] whenever they both came into contact.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''===\nDoctor Aphra is the assist character for [[Darth Vader]], available as a Unique card.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Aphra was first introduced in ''Darth Vader 3: Vader, Part III'', and rose to a level of popularity to the point where she was given her own solo series after the Vader book had ended.\n*She has been described by her creator, Kieron Gillen, as a \"dark mirror image of [[Indiana Jones]]\". This is reflected by her occasional utterances of quotes similar to those from the Indiana Jones film series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nDoctor Aphra Comic.png\nDoctor Aphra Comic Art.png\nAphra issue 1 cover.jpg\nDoctorAphra3.png\nAphra-Shot-StarWars16.png\nAphra.jpg\nStar_Wars_Doctor_Aphra_1_Story_Thus_Far.jpg\nDoctoraphra-annual1_no.jpg\nStar Wars Force Arena 6.jpg\nStar Wars Force Arena Promo.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Chelli Lona Aphra}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
