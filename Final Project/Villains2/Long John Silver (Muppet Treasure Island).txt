On the ship Hispaniola, Silver befriends young [[Jim Hawkins (Muppets)|Jim Hawkins]]. He even confessed one night that when he was eight, his father died at sea \u2014 \u201cfirst mate he was\u201d \u2014 after Jim tells him his own father (also a first mate) died at sea when he was seven.\n\nHowever, Silver is actually planning a mutiny amongst the crew of the Hispaniola, so as to seek Captain Flint's treasure himself. He is a deceptively charming man at first, until he is overheard by [[Gonzo]], [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] and Jim as he reveals his dastardly plans to his fellow pirates aboard the Hispaniola.\n\nUpon looking for the treasure, the pirates discovered that the treasure Flint left was empty, leading a brief mutiny against Silver, who allows Jim to escape.\n\nSilver managed to get his crew back on his team, but berated them for using a black spot, which was torn on a page from a Bible. Later, he and his crew capture [[Kermit |Smollet]] and [[Benjamina Gunn]] by having her tell where the treasure is hidden. When Smollet and Benjamina are left to die, Silver and his men finally found the treasure, which Benjamina revealed that it was in her place.\n\nWhen the pirates are heading back to their ship with the treasure, they discover the Hispaniola approaching. His crew thought the Ghost of Captain Flint coming towards them and run away in fear, but Silver knows that Jim is aboard the ship, trying to rescue Smollet and Benjamina.\n\nWhen the rest of the pirates are defeated, Silver surrenders, finding himself outnumbered.\n\nAt the end of the film, Silver is imprisoned to stand trial in Bristol, however fearing that he would be hanged, he makes his escape without his crew by taking whatever treasure he can in a lifeboat, but not before saying a rather touching goodbye to Jim Hawkins, where he declares he could \"never hurt\" Jim, because he is \"honest and brave and true\", something he himself isn't.\n\nHis fate is that his lifeboat was faulty and leaked. He had to swim to a nearby island and be marooned for the rest of his life with the company of an annoying talking pig-nosed Easter Island Head statue who won't stop telling him awful jokes.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Tim Curry has stated in several interviews that playing Long John Silver is one of his most favorite roles. He also said that he had always been a fan of the Muppets.\n* Tim Curry also starred in the 1996 Video game Muppet Treasure Island (video game) for Windows 95 PC by Activision in which he helps out the player as Jim Hawkins.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"140\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLong john and polly.jpg|Silver and his pet lobster Polly\nLong_John_Silver_-_Tim_Curry.jpg\nLong_John_Silver_(Muppets)_2.jpg\nMovie-MTI-Promo01.jpg\nMTI-Promo-SailingForAdventure.jpg\nMuppets Treasure Island 41565 Medium.jpg|Silver and half of his crew\nlong john silver.jpg\nPropirate.jpg|Silver singing ''When You're a Professional Pirate''\nBible page MTI.jpg|Silver holding the dreaded \"Black Spot\" while very angry at his crew for what they did\nLong_John_Silver_(Muppets_)_3.jpg\nMTI-Promo-Danger.jpg\nMTI-Promo-Dangling.jpg\nSilver's sinking boat.jpg|Silver's leaking boat\nLong_John_Silver's_defeat.jpg|Long John Silver unhappily marooned on an island\nCharacter.timcurrymuppet.jpg|Tim with his caricature behind the scenes of [[Muppet Treasure Island]]\nMuppet Treasure Island PC screenshot 1.jpg|Long John Silver saying goodbye to Jim Hawkins\nMuppet Treasure Island PC screenshot 3.jpg|Long John Silver introduces himself to the player in the galley.\nMuppet Treasure Island PC screenshot 2.jpg|Long John Silver holds Jim Hawkins hostage as he takes off the blindfold.\n</gallery>\n\n{{MuppetsWiki|Long John Silver}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Muppet Treasure Island characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
