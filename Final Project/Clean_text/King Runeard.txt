information spread regarding the origins the war The Arendellian citizens believed that the Northuldra were the enemy and that Runeard was brutally killed cold blood The truth wouldn discovered until over thirty four years Runeard granddaughters Elsa and Anna under the guide the spirits first glance Runeard was presented calm collected and upright person who cared about his people and family and was willing treat the neighboring Northuldrans equals Unbeknownst the rest the Arendellians including Lieutenant Mattias and Agnarr Runeard was truly vile selfish cruel hateful arrogant xenophobic dishonest power hungry manipulative and cold hearted tyrant who was obsessed with expanding his power and didn care about anyone anything other than himself his position king and the power and authority gave him Runeard was also hostile ruthless bigoted and merciless towards anyone who wasn within his power having perceived himself superior supreme person simply for being the highest place society king discriminated everyone else being below him based their race social rank and possibly gender including his own family servants soldiers commoners the Arendellian citizens and particularly the Northuldra These traits ultimately became Runeard undoing and negatively affected his kingdom and his entire bloodline The junior novelization substantiates this information though more supported Dangerous Secrets Runeard had very distant relationship both with his wife Rita and their son Agnarr only saw them political pawns and assets their kingdom rather than his family members and Rita who was princess from another country were arranged marriage which Runeard had presumably organized just create alliance with her home country and further increase his political status and power The only

their confining marriage After Rita finally broke down and fled upon having her memories her life Arendelle erased Pabbie Runeard refused accept that had been bad husband and was the only blame for her departure Besides claiming that she was carried off evil spirits subsequently locked all her things along with anything else that reminded him her Runeard also created harsh decree against the mentioning Rita name which had penalty immediate banishment Runeard had deep rooted fear magic that bordered extreme paranoia and xenophobia which believed that nothing good comes from magic that all beings who are magical have ties magic are untrustworthy and that magic corrupts people into thinking they are powerful and entitled that they can defy and overpower monarch like himself implied that Runeard knew Rita had her memories erased through unknown means This likely made him falsely believe that the fact that Rita had her memories erased gave her the willpower run away because magic was related Rita leaving him furthered his resentment magic and convinced him that was correct his false opinions about Having such views combined with his feelings superiority being king caused Runeard become very self righteous person who believed could never any wrong result refused ever take responsibility for his own faults and problems that occurred Arendelle and instead blamed them magic and magical spirits since blaming much easier than taking responsibility and magic unable defend itself These actions were again demonstrated perfectly when Runeard scapegoated magic for Rita disappearance since did not want accept that her leaving was entirely his fault When the Arendellians met the Northuldra Runeard immediately distrusted hated and became prejudiced towards them simply because their relationships with the Enchanted Forest magical spirits wrongly believed that since they were indigenous peasants who followed magic the Northuldra posed great risk and challenge his power and status they had eliminated The novelization reveals even greater depths Runeard wrath and bigotry towards the tribe during the gathering the forest looks other Northuldrans with condescending glances thinks better than them and even watches Northuldra children playing with the spirits shakes his head and frowns with disapproval and disgust The Northuldran Yelana witnesses Runeard doing all these things allowing her sense his hatred and realize that had been lying her people all the time Runeard was proven intelligent and cunning plotted subtle way destroy the
