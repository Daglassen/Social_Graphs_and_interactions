He is a mysterious visitor from out of town who forms a relationship with [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] in hopes of using her to steal an [[King Herz Der Sonne's Journal|ancient journal]].\n\n==Background==\nAndrew is the leader of the [[Separatists of Saporia]], an organisation bent on destroying the kingdom of [[Corona]] in an act of revenge. Andrew was tasked with retrieving a [[King Herz Der Sonne's Journal|Coronian journal]] belonging to King Herz Der Sonne, which holds many secrets about the kingdom. According to a conversation during a \"double date\", Andrew had been sending requests to the [[Captain of the Guards]] to have a look at the ancient journal of one of Corona's previous monarchs, King Herz Der Sonne. The captain denied these requests as the journal was off limits to the public, and sent Cassandra to deliver this message. Instead, Cassandra invited Andrew to visit Corona when the journal was displayed to the public, an offer he took.\n\n==Role in the series==\nDuring his visit to Corona, Andrew and Cassandra supposedly form a relationship, one Andrew hopes to use in order to retrieve the journal and take it back to the Separatists of Saporia. One night, after an awkward double date with Cassandra's friends, [[Rapunzel]] and [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]], Cassandra offers Andrew a private look at the journal, to sign their signatures and proclaim their love. While Cassandra has her back turned to sign her name, Andrew pulls out a dagger to kill her. However, his attack is immediately countered, as Cassandra had been manipulating him into revealing his plot the entire time. Cassandra nearly apprehends Andrew, but she is distracted by the arrival of Rapunzel. Andrew disarms Cassandra and handcuffs both her and Rapunzel while he makes his escape with the journal. Fortunately for the girls, [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]], arrives and frees the two. They make it outside and leap onto Andrew's hot air balloon just as it takes flight. A showdown between Andrew and Cassandra takes place, and after an intense struggle, he is ultimately defeated and the journal is retrieved. He is later arrested for his crimes whilst Cassandra is hailed a hero.\n\nAfter Varian's defeat, he ends up as Andrew's cellmate where he takes advantage of the boy's negative feelings and pretends to be his friend and together they manage to escape and take over the kingdom by erasing the King and Queen's memories while Rapunzel and her friends were traveling the world, until Varian saw his true colors and discovered his plan to destroy the kingdom, and helped Rapunzel to defeat him and his fellow separatists on their airship, saving Corona and Andrew and the separatists are later seen imprisoned in the dungeon, trapped in bubbles.\n\nIn \"[[Plus Est En Vous]]\", he is surprisingly and inexplicably seen amongst the crowd of Corona citizens, including Rapunzel and her family, as they all sing about their newfound happily ever after, even singing with them.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nAndrew is a tall, slender man with brown, voluminous hair and a well-trimmed beard. He wears a dark red, short-sleeved shirt, a white fleece sleeveless jacket over it, black pants, a black belt, two black beaded wristbands, and black boots. During the events of \"Under Raps\", his hair is in a bun by a light brown hair band. But in \"Rapunzel's Return\", it was tied by a band with two pink chemical bombs containing Varian's alchemy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*During their first confrontation, Cassandra questions whether or not \"Andrew\" is his real name, to which he replies, \"It's Hubert...\"\n*In the promos leading up to the premiere of the episode, Andrew was sold as a potential love interest for Cassandra.\n*Much like [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]], Hubert created a alias as he hated his real name.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nUnder Raps 29.png\nUnder Raps 31.png\nUnder Raps 1.png\nUnder Raps 35.png\nUnder Raps (2).jpg\nUnder Raps 37.png\nUnder Raps 4.png\nUnder Raps 2.png|Andrew about to kiss Cassandra\nUnder Raps 38.png\nUnder Raps (3).jpg\nUnder Raps (9).jpg|Andrew prepares to strike Cassandra...\nUnder Raps 40.png|...only to get disarmed by her\nUnder Raps (10).jpg\nUnder Raps 41.png\nAndrew's hair.png|Andrew with his hair let down\nRapunzel's Return (60).jpg\nRapunzel's Return (34).jpg|Andrew with Maisie, Kai, and Juniper\nRapunzel's Return (56).jpg\nImprisoned Andrew.png\nImprisoned Saporians.png|Andrew imprisoned\nUnder Raps storyboard 2.jpg\nUnder Raps storyboard 6.png\nUnder Raps storyboard 1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
