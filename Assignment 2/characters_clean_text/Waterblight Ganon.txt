Waterblight Ganon is a recurring Boss in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed] 


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Waterblight Ganon is one of the four phantoms of Calamity Ganon that took control of the Divine Beasts and responsible for the death of the Zora champion Mipha. He can be found either in Divine Beast Vah Ruta after trying to activate the main terminal, or in Hyrule Castle if Link has not freed Ruta.
Like the other Blight Ganons, Waterblight Ganon's weak point is his eye and horns. Landing repeated strikes to either spot with arrows will knock Waterblight Ganon to the ground, providing Link with the opportunity to attack while he is stunned. An arrow to Waterblight Ganon's eye will also cancel out any attacks that he attempts. Using an Ancient Arrow or Shock Arrow in particular will deal heavier damage to Waterblight Ganon. If Link has obtained the Master Sword at this point, its current attack power of 30 will rise to 60 while within Ruta.
In the first phase of the battle, Waterblight Ganon will attack Link using his spear. He will attempt to either stab Link, throw the spear at him, or swing the spear in a large circle. Link can use Cryonis to place blocks of ice between himself and Waterblight Ganon. When Waterblight Ganon attacks, he will break his spear on the Cryonis blocks, giving Link time to attack. Alternatively, Link can execute a Perfect Dodge and subsequent Flurry Rush when Waterblight Ganon either stabs or swings his spear. In addition, Parrying Waterblight Ganon's spear when it is thrown will stun him.
When Waterblight Ganon is reduced to half of his health, the water level will rise and four platforms will appear. During the second phase of the battle, Waterblight Ganon will teleport around the area, stopping above one of the platforms. He will then summon ice blocks, which proceed to move towards Link, dealing damage to Link if hit. Link can use Cryonis to destroy these blocks before they hit him. Waterblight Ganon will immediately follow this attack with his spear, usually by throwing it. To inflict damage onto Waterblight Ganon, Link must stand on a different platform and shoot him with arrows.
Defeating Waterblight Ganon will free the spirit of the Zora champion Mipha, and allows her to appear to Link. She gives him Mipha's Grace as a gift, and a Heart Container falls from where Waterblight Ganon is defeated.
