She serves as the primary antagonist of the episode \"[[To Smell and Back]]\".\n\n==History==\nHer guardian hero, MagMan, had defended her home and her people from the evil mantle-dwellers until his herothalamus stopped producing bravezymes, causing him to lose his heroism.

After fighting off Queen Gabnidine and her guards, Randy throws a Tengu Fireball at a tank of methane gas.
