His quick temper and somewhat clumsy antics were a constant source of laughs for those around him (especially [[Khan's Pilots|elite pilots]]), something he could absolutely not stand. He was constantly heard shouting \"Stop laughing!\" at the top of his lungs.\n\nWhen he unsuccessfully tries to invest at [[Louie's Place]], Doug resorts to forgery to use Mr. Khan's elite pilots to take it by force. When Mr. Khan learns of this, he terminates Doug on the spot.\n\nAngered and driven off the deep end, Benson tries to blow up Louie's Place again, but instead blows up the hut and him with it due since [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]] moved the dynamite. He is stranded in a crater where a seagull laughs at him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Doug claims that he's been laughed at since he was five years old.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nKitten Kaboodle-Louie's Last Stand01.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand01.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand02.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand03.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand04.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand05.jpg|\"Don't laugh.\"\nLouie's Last Stand06.jpg|Doug resorts to forgery.\nLouie's Last Stand07.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand08.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand09.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand10.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand11.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand12.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand13.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand14.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand15.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand16.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand17.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand18.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand19.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand20.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand21.jpg|Mr. Khan is not impressed with Doug\nLouie's Last Stand22.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand24.jpg\nkhanindustries3_04.jpg\nLouie's Last Stand23.jpg\nTalespin - 150 - louie's last stand Video - Rediff Videos.jpg|Douglas Benson's defeat\n</gallery>\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benson, Douglas}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
