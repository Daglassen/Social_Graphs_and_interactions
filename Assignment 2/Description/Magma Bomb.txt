They go unnamed in {{OoT}}, {{TP}}, {{ST}}, and {{ALBW}}.\n\n==Characteristics==\n==={{OoT|-}}===\nIn {{OoT}}, {{Plural|OoT3D|Magma Bomb}} fall from the sky during volcanic eruptions on {{Term|OoT3D|Death Mountain|link}} when {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} is a child. When this happens, the ground will tremble and {{Plural|OoT3D|Magma Bomb}} will descend shortly after. There are two types of {{Plural|OoT3D|Magma Bomb}} that will fall: a series of sporadically-placed rocks and {{Plural|OoT3D|Magma Bomb}} which will fall directly onto {{Term|OoT3D|Link}}. These can be deflected by using any {{Term|OoT3D|Shield}}.\n\n==={{TP|-}}===\nIn {{TP}}, {{Plural|TPHD|Magma Bomb}} fall from the sky during {{Term|TPHD|Link}}'s first visit to {{Term|TPHD|Death Mountain}}, including the  {{Term|TPHD|Molten Shard|link}}. They can be avoided by looking at their shadows to see where they will land and by listening for the whistling sound they make as they approach the ground. {{Plural|TPHD|Magma Bomb}} tend to explode when making contact with the ground. Once {{Term|TPHD|Link}} has quelled {{Term|TPHD|Fyrus|link}}'s rage in the {{Term|TPHD|Goron Mines|link}}, the {{Plural|TPHD|Magma Bomb}} will stop falling permanently.\n\n==={{PH|-}}===\nIn {{PH}}, {{Plural|PH|Magma Bomb}} fly out of the active volcano in the {{Term|PH|Isle of Ember}}. {{Term|PH|Link}} must avoid them while climbing to its summit in order to enter the {{Term|PH|Temple of Fire|link}}.\n\n==={{ST|-}}===\nIn {{ST}}, when visiting the {{Term|ST|Fire Realm|link}} for the first time, {{Plural|ST|Magma Bomb}} fall around and on the {{Term|ST|Spirit Tracks (Object)|link}}. {{Term|ST|Link}} must use the {{Term|ST|Cannon|link}} in order to blast them out of the rails. When {{Term|ST|Link}} arrives to {{Term|ST|Goron Village|link}}, he finds out that several paths are blocked by the debris. Link must then get {{Term|ST|Mega Ice|link}} to the Village in order to open these paths. On his way to the {{Term|ST|Fire Sanctuary|link}}, {{Term|ST|Link}} must avoid more {{Plural|ST|Magma Bomb}}.\n\n{{Term|ST|Cragma}}, the {{Term|ST|Boss}} of the {{Term|ST|Fire Temple}}, also uses {{Plural|ST|Magma Bomb}} as one of its attacks.\n\n==={{ALBW|-}}===\nIn {{ALBW}}, a volcanic eruption takes place when {{Term|ALBW|Link}} first arrives at {{Term|ALBW|Hyrule|link}}'s {{Term|ALBW|Death Mountain|link}}, causing {{Plural|ALBW|Magma Bomb}} to continually rain down around {{Term|ALBW|Link}}. Occasionally, a {{Term|ALBW|Magma Bomb}} will burst into several {{Plural|ALBW|Green Rupee|link}} when it smashes into the ground, while sometimes it will spawn a {{Term|ALBW|Deadrock|link}} instead.\n\n{{Plural|ALBW|Magma Bomb}} will no longer threaten {{Term|ALBW|Link}} once he reaches the summit of {{Term|ALBW|Death Mountain}}, but will resume falling if he returns to the {{Term|ALBW|Death Mountain|display=Mountain}}'s lower portions.\n\n==={{TFH|-}}===\nIn {{TFH}}, {{Plural|TFH|Volcanic Rock}} only appear in the third stage of {{Term|TFH|Blazing Trail|link}} and during the \"Avoid the volcanic rocks!\" {{Term|TFH|Drablands Challenge|link}} in the {{Term|TFH|Den of Flames|link}} and the {{Term|TFH|Dragon Citadel|link}}. The {{Term|TFH|Links|link}} must avoid the falling rocks while traversing these [[Levels in Tri Force Heroes|Levels]]; being hit by one will burn them as well as causing damage.\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\nIn {{BotW}}, {{Plural|BotW|Magma Bomb}} fall from {{Term|BotW|Death Mountain}} and explode around the {{Term|BotW|Eldin (Region)|link}} {{Term|BotW|Region|link}}.
