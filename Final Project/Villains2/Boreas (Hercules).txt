His name means \"North Wind\" or \"Devouring One\". In Greek mythology, Boreas is depicted as being very strong, with a violent temper to match. He is the eldest of the four ''Anemoi'' (wind gods), and brother of Eurus, Notus and Zephyrus, the gods of the east, south and west winds.\n\n==Background==\n===Power and Abilities===\nAs a god, Boreas possesses the natural powers and abilities of an Olympian god such as immortality, omnipresence, vast strength, and the potential to do magic such as the ability to shape-shift, to teleport, and to manifest objects. As the God of the North Wind, he controls the wind, and transforms himself into wind or a powerful tornado when angered.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Animated Series]]''===\n====\"[[Hercules and the Spartan Experience]]\"====\nAdonis is drafted into the Spartan ROTC, and begs Hercules to save him. Boreas, who has a long-running feud with Ares, attempts to disrupt the proceedings. At the end of the episode Hercules traps him inside a giant metal pipe.\n\n====\"[[Hercules and the Tiff on Olympus]]\"====\nBoreas is only seen from behind very briefly when the Gods call a meeting.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His appearance in the series differs greatly from that of the original mythology. Boreas was frequently shown as a winged old man with shaggy hair and beard, holding a conch shell and wearing a billowing cloak. Aside from the cloak, he lacked all the other\u00a0features. His Roman name is Aquilo.\n*Boreas is the eldest of the four Anemoi (wind gods). None of the others appear in the animated series.\n*In the mythology, Boreas fell in love with an Athenian princess called Orithyia. She did not appear in the series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nBoreas 1.jpg|On Mount Olympus.\nBoreas 2.jpg|Preventing Hermes from leaving.\nBoreas 3.jpg|Hermes and Boreas.\nBoreas 4.jpg|Raging with anger over Ares.\nboreas1.jpg|Boreas laughs at his own joke.\nboreas2.jpg|Discussing Ares with Hermes.\nboreas3.jpg|Angry Boreas.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
