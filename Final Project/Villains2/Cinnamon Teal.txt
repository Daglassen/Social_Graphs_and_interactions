After Victor Loser betrayed her, she helped [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|nephews]] prove that Donald was innocent.\n\n===Boom! Studios comics===\nIn the 2011 ''[[DuckTales (Boom! Studios)|DuckTales]]'' comic book by [[Boom! Studios]], Cinnamon, now apparently a criminal again, appears in the \"Rightful Owners\" arc. She assists [[John D. Rockerduck]] to win a bet he made with [[Scrooge McDuck]] on who is [[Duckburg]]'s biggest philanthropist. She hypnotizes [[Gladstone Gander]] (who is now named Agent X) so Rockerduck can have his luck on his side and win the bet with it. Gladstone is well known about his unpredictable and unimaginable luck, so John D. Rockerduck is more than sure that he will win the bet, but Cinnamon has other plans, as her powers grow as she says that soon she won't have any need for Rockerduck.\n\nCinnamon reappears in the ''DuckTales''/''Darkwing Duck'' crossover story \"[[Dangerous Currency]]\", where she is a member of the \"League of Eve-il\" along with [[Magica De Spell]], [[Ammonia Pine]], and [[Camille Chameleon]]. They are in an alliance with The [[Phantom Blot]], the Fearsome Four, and the [[Beagle Boys]]. They are also later joined by [[Negaduck]]. It should be noted, though, that \"Dangerous Currency\" was never approved by Disney and is not considered canon (this likely applies to \"Rightful Owners\" as well).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCinnamon Teal01.jpg\n559px-The League of Eve-il.jpg\n640px-Alliance.png\nVillains unite.png\nSisters-412x400.jpg\n639px-The legue of eve-il 2.png\n640px-Cinnamon_1.jpg|Gladstone hypnotized by Cinnamon Teal\nCinnamon Teal02.jpg\nCinnamon Teal03.jpg\nDonald-Cinnamon.jpg|Cinnamon Teal with Donald Duck\nCinnamon Teal04.jpg|Daisy hypnotized by Cinnamon Teal\nCinnamon Teal05.jpg\nCinnamon Teal06.png\nCinnamon Teal07.jpg\nCinnamon Teal08.jpg\nDarkwing-duck-18-battle.jpg\nCinnamon Teal09.png\nCinnamon Teal10.png\nCinnamon Teal11.png\nCinnamon Teal12.png\nCinnamon Teal13.png\nCinnamon Teal14.png\nCinnamon Teal15.png\nLeaveWithGbge.jpg\nCinnDunked.jpg\nSITE - 354.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*She shares a name with a species of duck called the \"Cinnamon Teal\", although she bears no resemblance to the usually brown-feathered bird.\n\n{{DuckTales}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Teal, Cinnamon}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]"
