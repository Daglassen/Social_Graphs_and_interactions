When he reaches Dueling Peaks Stable, he will sit at the table inside for a moment.\n\nWhen spoken to, Bugut frequently makes reference to his old age.<ref>{{Cite|Climbing cliffs is a challenge on a rainy day, even for an old hand like me. Best to just wait out the rain on those days.|Bugut|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|We're right near the stable. I can't wait to rest these old bones.|Bugut|BotW}}</ref> In his youth, he was a mountain-climber,<ref>{{Cite|Take a look at these cliffs. So steep, so treacherous. Back in my day, I wouldn't have hesitated to climb right up 'em.|Bugut|BotW}}</ref> particularly on the {{Term|BotW|Dueling Peaks|link}}, where he used the Stable as a base.<ref name=\"Lad\"/> He occasionaly remarks that climbing is difficult in the rain.<ref>{{Cite|Climbin' is hard in the rain...|Bugut|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Climbing cliffs is a challenge on a rainy day.

Makes it harder for monsters to find you, she says.|Bugut|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|The stealth chest guard masks your movements and makes it hard for monsters to spot you.|Bugut|BotW}}</ref> Bugut thinks he's too old for Claree's, and he doesn't have enough {{Plural|BotW|Rupee|link}} to afford the Stealth Chest Guard.<ref>{{Cite|Alas, I'm too old for her, and too poor for that outfit...|Bugut|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It'd come in real handy when I'm on the road, but at that price, it's out of my reach...just like the cutie who sells it.|Bugut|BotW}}</ref>\n\n{{Term|BotW|Bugut}} will offer advice at various points on his journey.
