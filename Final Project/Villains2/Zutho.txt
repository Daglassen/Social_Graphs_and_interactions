He is a shady mandrill that Tarzan, Terk, and Tantor first encountered as kids at the forbidden side of the river.\n\n==Tarzan and the Face from the Past==\nWhile Tarzan teaches Zutho and [[Gozan and Hungo|his friends]] how to make spears, a fire broke out and nearly destroyed the jungle but the rain put it out. Tarzan blamed himself and ended up in Zutho's debt. Several years later, Zutho resurfaces in order to get Tarzan to fulfill his favor into dealing with some annoying howler monkeys that were keeping him and his friends up at night. With help from Jane, Terk, and Tantor, Tarzan did the right thing and admitted what happened the day of the fire to Kala, who then processed to punish Zutho.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nZutho1.png\nZutho2.png\nZutho3.png\nZutho4.png\nZutho5.png\nZutho6.png\nZutho's defeat.png|Zutho's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tarzan}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
