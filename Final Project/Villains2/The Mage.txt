"[[File:Mage.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''The Mage''' (voiced by [[B.J. Ward]]) is a supporting character and antihero from the ''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]'' animated series.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Mage_star.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nThe Mage is a powerful sorceress who guarded the Infinite City during Phobos' reign. She used the Heart of Kandrakar to create the Star of Threbe, implying that she may have once been a Guardian and the Keeper of the Heart like Will and Nerissa. When Nerissa was banished and imprisoned in Mount Thanos, the Mage helped her, hoping that her guilt and an act of compassion would reform her. The original Mage died prior to season 1. She probably died from old age or she was killed by Nerissa, as Nerissa said in \"O is for Obedience\" when she said \"..to her regret\" implying that Nerissa probably killed the mage for power or for some kind of reason and then was replaced by a disguised Nerissa. She is unique to the animated series and does not appear in the comics.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Mage has a human appearance and incredible magic, which qualifies her as an Escanor.\n*She is similar to The Oracle in the comic books.\n*There has been some speculation whether it was Nerissa or the real mage who created the Star of Threbe but it has to be the mage as the star of was made when Elyon's mother was about three and Nerissa became mage only 18 years ago and Elyon's mother was shown to be in her late twenties when Elyon was born 13 years ago and Phobos was shown to be at least 15 meaning that Nerissa would still been in Mt. Thanos.\n*The Mage and then Nerissa possessed the mage ring which had the ability to open folds the fact that Nerissa had the ring indicates that Nerissa stole it from her or killed the mage and took it.\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mage, The}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Sorceresses]]"
