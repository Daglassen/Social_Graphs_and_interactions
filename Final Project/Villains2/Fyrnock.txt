They live on the planet of Fort Anaxes and are very sensitive to sunlight. However, in darkness, they are deadly hunters. When [[Hera Syndulla]] and [[Sabine Wren]] stop on Fort Anaxes to find supplies, they are attacked by the Fyrnocks, which they keep at bay until the rest of the crew of the Ghost rescue them.\n\nLater on, [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]] return to Fort Anaxes to tame and use the Fyrnocks as part of a trap for [[the Grand Inquisitor]]. Though the Fyrnocks succeed in killing his stormtroopers, the Fyrnocks ultimately are no match for the Utapauan. As a last attempt, Ezra taps into the Dark side of the Force, summoning the mother Fyrnock, which is much larger than the others. Though she is unable to defeat the Grand Inquisitor, her attacks give Ezra and Kanan enough time to escape him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHera-and-Sabine,-Alone-in-the-Dark-12.png\nGathering Forces 24.jpg\nGathering Forces 27.jpg\nGathering Forces 32.jpg\nOut of Darkness Concept Art 10.jpg\nOut of Darkness Concept Art 11.jpg\nOut of Darkness Concept Art 12.jpg\nOut of Darkness Concept Art 13.jpg\nFyrnock Card.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External Links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Fyrnock|Wookieepedia}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
