He created chocolate anchovy strudels, which his employees must have liked because they ate so much they got fat, but then all walked out in disgust. This labor dispute angered Heinrich so much that he swore his revenge on them, as well as showing all the world's candy factories that he is the world's best chocolatier. Learning that the Mayans were the first race to convert cocoa into chocolate, Heinrich moved to Central America, where he made a new factory in a rundown temple. Heinrich used his mosquitoes to put mind control juice in the natives, bamboozling them into making chocolate for him, effectively giving himself a slave labor force, but the mind control was only temporary, as the next morning the slaves would have no memory of working a night shift at his factory. He also used the mind control juice on the Rangers (except [[Chip and Dale|Dale]]). He almost made [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]], [[Monterey Jack|Monty]], [[Chip and Dale|Chip]], and [[Zipper]] into chocolate candy, but Dale saved them in time. Heinrich ordered the hypnotized Rangers  to go after Dale, but when Chip fell on his head, this broke the hypnosis and he instead saved Dale. Dale and the restored Chip rushed to save the rest of the Rangers from Heinrich's mind control and he was mad at his mosquitoes for failing. Just has he was was about to put Monty, Gadget, and Zipper in the fire pot, Chip 'n' Dale pushed the stone on his drum and the others stopped in time and got away. The mosquitoes, fed up with Heinrich's lording over them, instead turned on him and gave him a taste of his own medicine, attacking him with mind control juice. The hypnotized Heinrich von Sugarbottom was made to reforest the area he had deforested; and was last seen planting saplings of cocoa trees.\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
