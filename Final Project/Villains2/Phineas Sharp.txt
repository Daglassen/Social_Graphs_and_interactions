He stole the master list of S.H.U.S.H. agents, so that he could lure Blunt to his island resort in the Salad Sea, hoping to make the elder agent's erstwhile retirement \"permanent\".\n\nHaving the list of S.H.U.S.H. agents, Phineas planned on auctioning off the list to the highest bidder and cornering the China tea market. To achieve this, Phineas invited villains to his island resort. His scheme was foiled by [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] and Blunt, who switched the real list with a grocery list taken from Horatio. To the end of this scene, Phineas Sharp was last seen being threatened with a pounding by [[Hammerhead Hannigan]], the buyer of the agents list.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Among those villains invited to the island, several characters of other series made cameo appearances.\n*[[Ammonia Pine]], [[Steelbeak]], [[Hammerhead Hannigan]], [[Anna Matronic]],\u00a0and [[Lilliput (Darkwing Duck)|Lilliput]] also appeared in the episode.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nPhineas Sharp - Phineas Sharp.png\nPhineas Sharp2.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sharp, Phineas}}\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
