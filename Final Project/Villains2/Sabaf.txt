He first appeared in the episode \"[[The Living Mummies of Toth-Ra!]]\" as the secondary antagonist.\n\n== Role in the series==\nSabaf hails from generations of bodyguards that once served the pharaoh [[Toth-Ra]]. The first of them learned that Toth-Ra was prophesied to one day rise again; however, that day never came. To keep their civilization active, Sabaf's family puppeteered Toth-Ra's corpse and masqueraded as Toth-Ra. At the beginning of the episode, he is seen \"delivering\" the offering of crops to the pharaoh's tomb, and from inside raises Toth-Ra's body to announce the offering as acceptable, and presents the others a transient moment of sunlight. While still in Toth-Ra's tomb, he catches [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Louie]] and [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] in Toth-Ra's treasure room and threatens to hang them over a pit of pikes. However, the duo fool him into believing Louie is a prince and must be buried properly. Sabaf lets his guard down, allowing the kids to escape.\n\nHowever, the kids end up back where they started, which allows Sabaf to manipulate Toth-Ra from behind in hopes of getting the kids to surrender. Unfortunately, the contraption controlling Toth-Ra breaks apart and they discover Sabaf behind it all. Then, the other civilians revolt and are also made privy to the truth, thus they imprison Sabaf inside a coffin for his deception. At that moment, Toth-Ra comes to life, but he is returned to his dead state by the efforts of the civilians. An impatient and hungry Sabaf (supposedly forgiven) is last seen among the group as they leave the pyramids and celebrate with burritos.\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Falcons]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
