They can also fall forward and crash their entire body into the ground or launch large fragments of their rocky frame at {{Term|BotW|Link}}. \n\nTo defeat a {{Term|BotW|Stone Talus}}, {{Term|BotW|Link}} can climb onto its body and attack the {{Term|BotW|Ore Deposit|link}} on its back, usually located on top or at the back of the {{Term|BotW|Sub-Boss|link}}. {{Term|BotW|Link}} can inflict major damage by using a double-handed {{Term|BotW|Weapon|link}} or {{Plural|BotW|Bomb Arrow|link}}. After taking damage, {{Plural|BotW|Stone Talus}} attempt to throw {{Term|BotW|Link}} off by shaking themselves. To make climbing easier, {{Term|BotW|Link}} can use a {{Term|BotW|Remote Bomb|link}} to blast apart its arms, hindering it temporarily. {{Plural|BotW|Stone Talus}} regenerate lost body parts shortly after losing them. If you can't climb onto it, stun it with a normal arrow, shooting the {{Term|BotW|Ore Deposit|link}} on its back, making it fall on its face. If you are new to Taluses, we recommend trying the Stone Talus Senior or the Stone Talus Junior first.   \n\nUpon being defeated, a {{Term|BotW|Stone Talus}} leaves behind {{Plural|BotW|Gem|link}} depending of its type. By defeating all Stone Taluses in {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Kingdom|link}}, as well as all other types of Talus, Link can receive the [[Medal of Honor: Talus]] from [[Kilton]]. This can only be done after completing the \"[[Destroy Ganon]]\" [[Main Quest]].\n\n====Locations====\n* {{Term|BotW|Great Plateau|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Deya Lake|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|North Dueling Peaks|link}} (Senior)\n* {{Term|BotW|Dueling Peaks South|link}} (Junior)\n* {{Term|BotW|West Nabi Lake|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|North Mable Ridge|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Martha's Landing|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Lake Floria|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Gama Cove|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Ovli Plain|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Cliffs of Quince|link}}\n\n=====Luminous=====\n* {{Term|BotW|Mapla Point|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Lake Hylia North|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Lake Kolomo|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Champion's Gate North|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|South Koukot Plateau|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Mount Nabooru|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|South Taafei Hill|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|East Mount Granajh|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Upland Lindor|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Southern Tal Tal Peak|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Crenel Hills|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Rutimala Hill|link}}\n\n=====Rare=====\n* {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle West|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|West Vatorsa Snowfield|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Illumeni Plateau|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Kolami Bridge South|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Gisa Crater|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Tabantha Hills|link}}\n* {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle Underground|link}}\n\n==={{StBotW|-}}===\n{{Future Release|Game}}\n{{Plural|StBotW|Stone Talus}} appear as {{Plural|StBotW|Enemy}} in the {{StBotW}}.
