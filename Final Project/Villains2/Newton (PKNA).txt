He is a battle droid of [[Organization (PKNA)|the Organization]] who is used in some delicate missions despite his questionable competence.\n\n==Character==\nNewton is slightly dumb and impatient and frequently uses the hard way to resolve the situation, not knowing the delicate art of diplomacy. For this reason, [[Vostok]], the Organization's scientist, is unable to bear him, but the dislike is mutual. He's a very dutiful droid, who put the interests of his masters before all, without considering any moral scruples. Newton's most beloved item is a green tie with ping frogs, that everybody else finds ugly.\n\n==Appearances==\nNewton appears in only three issues. The first time, [[PKNA 14: Carpe Diem|issue #14]], he and [[The Duck Avenger]] work together because of mayor reasons that force them to collaborate. The other two times the masked duck and the droid are adversaries on opposite sides. In issue #34, he helps the Griffin in his attempt to capture Trip, the Griffin's own past self. In issue #43, Newton was arrested by the Time Police along with the senior leaders of the Organization. He's presumably reprogrammed or placed in a cronocapsule in the prison Time \u00d8 to serve his sentence for numerous crimes.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://paperpedia.fandom.com/it/wiki/Newton http://it.paperpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Newton]\n\n{{PKNA}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
