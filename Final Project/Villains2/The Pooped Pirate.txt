What I wouldn't give to see the look on Cap'n Jack Sparrow's face when he hears tell 'tis only me what's got the goods, haha!|The Pooped Pirate}}\n\n'''The Pooped Pirate''' also known as the '''Gluttonous Pirate''' or the '''Buccaneer''' is a character from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThe Pooped Pirate was a gluttonous, greedy, and womanizing pirate who served as part of the [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|crew]] of the [[Wicked Wench]] during the golden age of piracy in the early 18th century. The ship came to raid the colony of Puerto Dorado on the island of [[Isla Tesoro]] in search of a great treasure hidden by its officials. During this raid the Wench was competing for the treasure with [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] who the pooped pirate himself seemed to show an amenity with.\n\nBy unknown means, the pooped pirate came into possession of a map detailing the treasure's location in the Castillo del Morro fortress on Isla Tesoro as-well as the key to the treasury. As his crew-mates ransacked the town, the pooped pirate studied his map while mocking Sparrow's lack of the resources. Unknown to the pirate, Sparrow was in a barrel behind him studying the map and ducking before being observed. By unknown means, Sparrow obtained the key of the pooped pirate to take the treasure for his own.\n\n===Development History===\nThe pooped pirate was designed by [[Marc Davis]], based on concept art which he had made of historic pirate John \"Long Ben\" Every (c 1643-1679). This art was created for back when Pirates of the Caribbean was intended to be a Madame Tussaud inspired wax-museum attraction featuring famous pirates. He gets the officially used moniker of the Pooped Pirate due to his visible exhaustion when encountered on the ride.\n\nIn the original incarnation version of Pirates of the Caribbean, he was shown holding a woman's undergarments rather than a map and made comments to guests about a woman he was pursuing as she hid in terror in the barrel behind him. The original scene was highly inappropriate, playing his attempts at sexual-assault for comedy and romanticizing said form of crimes. Due to this, the scene was altered in [[1997]] to simply have him eating food while a cat randomly popped out of a barrel behind him for no particular reason.\n\nIn [[2006]] the scene was changed yet-again when elements of the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|Pirates of The Caribbean]]'' films were being integrated into the ride. Said refurbished scene recycled the original gag of a hiding enemy in the barrel albeit with the new story of Jack Sparrow hunting treasure and additional gag of him studying the map.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Pirates of the Caribbean===\nThe Pooped Pirate appears in the town of Puerto Dorado, speaking in the direction of guests as they pass by. He attempts to study his map while Jack Sparrow pops out of a barrel behind him. This causes a nearby dog to bark at Jack only for the pooped pirate to try and shut the dog up as he studies the map, oblivious to Jack Sparrow's presence.\n\nDuring the treasure-room scene, the pirate's key can be seen inserted in the keyhole of the doors. The implication is that Jack took the key from the pooped pirate and managed to indulge in the treasures for himself.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n===Video games===\n====''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''====\nAn adaptation of the Pooped Pirate appears in the Puerto Dorado stage of the Pirates of the Caribbean mini-games within this video-game. The pirate here possesses the keys to the treasury hidden beneath the mayor of Puerto Dorado's mansion where [[Blackbeard]] stores his treasure. The player distracts him by doing dances and pirate imitations as their ally [[Black Barty]] hides in a barrel nearby and steals the pirate's keys.\n\n====''Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life''====\nThe pooped pirate appears on Isla Tesoro as a ghost in this game. He reprises his role from the attraction where the player witnesses Jack hiding in a barrel behind him to rob.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Both a 2006 action-figure and his Park Starz line [[vinylmation]] figure identify him as, \"The Buccaneer\". Buccaneer being a word typically used as a synonym for pirates which was traditionally used for privateers of the 17th century who while not necessarily officially working for the British or French governments, did privateering work by attacking Spanish ships and settlements. The name comes from sailors of this variety who made settlements on the French colony of [[Tortuga]] who would live in huts called'' boucanes ''and hunted pigs to cook a kind of jerky called ''viande boucan\u00e9e''.\n**It is possible that this title was affiliated with the Pooped Pirate due to the, \"Gluttonous\" incarnation of the character which ran from 1997-2006 in-which he was seen eating large amounts of ham nearby a pig.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nExhaustedpirateart.JPG.jpg|Concept art by Marc Davis\nExhaustedpirate.JPG.jpg|The original version of the scene\nEatingheavily.JPG.jpg|The 1997 version of the scene\n81cHOSaDANL.
