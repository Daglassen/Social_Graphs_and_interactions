Bohrin is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Bohrin is an elderly Goron who works as a miner at the Southern Mine in the Eldin Canyon. In the past, he was young and strong, but even though he's older now, he still has a lot of fight. Bohrin works the night shift; during the day he can be found asleep beneath a tarp while the other Gorons work, before waking up at night and working the entire shift alone. By the following morning, he is much too tired and goes straight back to sleep.
Bohrin may be spoken to while he is working. When asked, he'll explain that the ore from the Southern Mine is sold, which Goron City profits from. He explains that the Gorons used to mine at the Death Mountain Summit, until the Divine Beast Vah Rudania appeared and made the area too dangerous. As a result, the Gorons now work at the Southern Mine. He also gives directions to Goron City, and warns Link that the road ahead is dangerous.
