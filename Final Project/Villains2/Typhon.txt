He was the most powerful of all the Titans. He was challenged by Zeus and beaten by [[Hera]] when she hurled a lightning bolt at one of Typhon's nostrils. He was imprisoned under Mount Etna, resulting in him gaining a massive headache lasting centuries, during which he sought revenge on Zeus.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (TV series)]]''===\nHe appeared in the episode; \"[[Hercules and the Return of Typhon]]\". While battling [[Echidna]], Typhon's wife, [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] accidentally freed his father's greatest nightmare and Typhon prepared for a rematch by spending \"quality time\" with Echidna and baby [[Ladon]]. When Zeus and Hercules reappeared, Typhon throttled his enemy and nearly succeeded when Hera once more intervened and threw a lightning bolt into his nostril, forcing all three monsters to flee, though Typhon demanded another rematch the next time. When they discover that Hera and Zeus were working together, Echidna and Typhon attempted to get Homer to fix the facts.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Long Nightmare]]\",\u00a0Phantasos, the god of dreams and younger brother of\u00a0Morpheus, served as the main antagonist in the episode. He spreads his own blanket of nightmares over the world, causing Hercules and Phil and the rest of Greece to have bad dreams. Phantasos takes the form of Typhon during the final stage of his battle with Hercules before being pulled back into reality.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Typhon's voice actor was cast with TV personality Regis Philbin. Typhon's wife, Echidna, was cast with Philbin's then-co-star Kathie Lee Gifford.\n*In Greek Myth, Typhon wasn't actually a Titan. He was created by [[Gaia]] to avenge the Titans.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTyphon.jpg\nTyphon_Hercules.jpg\nTyphon3.png\nHades Challenge Typhon.png|Typhon as he appeared in ''[[Hades Challenge]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Titans]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]"
