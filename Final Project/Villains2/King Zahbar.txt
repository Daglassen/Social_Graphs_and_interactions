King Zahbar gets hold of the emerald bringing his queen to life by sunlight as Aladdin and his friends take the chest with the remaining jewels to Agrabah. She transformed King Zahbar into a very, huge and giant hawk to get rid of Aladdin and the gang but by doing as she commanded him to. She travels to Agrabah to get the remaining gems and revive her three brothers by flying unto him in flight. Because Mesmaria was destroyed by The Great Rift, they\u2019ve took over Agrabah. When the Sultan objected and forced Queen Deluca to get out of the palace, he\u2019s turned into a jewel, after she called him an old man. When Jasmine went up against Queen Deluca, she was the next one to be turned into a gem and kicked them out of the palace, tossing them into Abu\u2019s hat to catch it.\n\nThe evil queen drew plans to take over the Seven Deserts. However, her brothers did not like the idea of her becoming the most powerful ruler of Agrabah, the siblings start arguing ending up using their magic against each other. This caused the mysterious Great Rift to appear and it is in the form of a transparent, green monster with red eyes, and fangs of a saber-toothed cat. Aladdin discovered and tried to tell that the monster that fed on anger from the Mesmarians as they don\u2019t listen and continue fighting each other, destroying the palace. Aladdin seeks the help of King Zahbar, the only Mesmarian not affected by the emeralds. He tells Aladdin that the emeralds have great magic as well as great anger causing the Great Rift to be disappeared. As a team, Aladdin, Iago, Genie, Carpet and Abu take Queen Deluca\u2019s emerald and destroy it, until the brothers\u2019 emeralds are depowered. After Queen Deluca was no longer evil again, the spell was broken and Sultan and Jasmine has returned to normal again and King Zahbar returns to his human form and the whole gang welcomes them to Agrabah at the end.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zahbar, King}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Falcons]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
