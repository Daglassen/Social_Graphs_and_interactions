Also unlike his son, he's shown to not take losing well.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nLord Elrod makes his debut in \"[[The Princess Knight]]\". Years earlier, Lord Elrod was once a knight in the Kingdom of Brazendell. He fought in the Swordsman's Cup when he was younger and went up against [[King Raul and Queen Lucia|Queen Lucia]]. To keep himself from losing, he cheated by delibrately breaking Lucia's wrist, causing her to forfeit as a result.\n\nRoughly fifty years later, he became Lord Elrod of Brazendell and has a son named Sir Cassius. His son has become the defending champion fencer of Brazendell. He pushed his son into cheating and aiming for Sir Elezar's wrist, unaware that Sir Elezar was Lucia's daughter [[Princess Elena]] in disguise, when it came down to fighting her. Lord Elrod and Sir Cassius were also unaware that Elena was spying on them when Lord Elrod was telling his son what he did to her mother and to do the same to her. In the end, Elena beats Sir Cassius at the final duel of the tournament. His son humbly gives her the winning trophy and Lucia's mother [[Luisa]] angrily threatens to challenge Lord Elrod to a duel for injuring her daughter on purpose, causing him to storm off in anger.\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elrod, Lord}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
