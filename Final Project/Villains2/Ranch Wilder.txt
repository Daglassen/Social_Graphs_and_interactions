After a game, Ranch interviews George. While they are arguing, George punches Ranch as payback, giving him a black eye, which he tends to press aussalt charges.\n\nLater, [[J.P.]] accidentally reveals to Ranch that [[Roger Bowman]] has the ability to see angels and that George has been winning through the advice Roger gave him. Hoping to destroy George's career permanently, Ranch informs the press of this and [[Hank Murphy]] threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to [[Maggie Nelson]] about his special ability and at a press conference, they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Hank allows him to remain as Angels' manager, much to Ranch's anger.\n\nHank later fires Ranch because of his denigration of the team and he was forever banned from a career in baseball.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wilder, Ranch}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Angels in the Outfield characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
