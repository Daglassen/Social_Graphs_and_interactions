However, she is overprotective of her son, always spoiling him and never noticing or believing that Bash is a troublemaker. She also knows that McFist is evil, but she isn't bothered by it and even loves it when he gets thrilled at finding a way to defeat the Ninja. She seems to always get what she wants, like the biggest tree for the McFist Industries Christmas party in \"[[Silent Punch, Deadly Punch]]\", McFist helping Bash with his science project in \"[[Attack of the Killer Potatoes]]\", and McFist and Viceroy giving Bash pranks to use on his fellow classmates in \"[[Pranks for Nothing]]\". While usually calm in comparison to her husband, Marci gets frustated at McFist for not calling out for someone to help Bash in \"[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]\", and she is so angry at McFist attempting to destroy her son that apparently, she is even angrier at him than the Sorcerer is at him for failing in \"[[Bash Johnson: 11th Grade Ninja]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\n===Everyday===\nMarci is tall and blonde hair, blue eyes, and a beauty mark under her left eye. She wears a light blue dress with a dark gray collar, buttons, and a belt, and she wears dark gray high heels. She also has a golden bracelet on her right wrist.\n\n==Role in the series==\nShe is [[Hannibal McFist]]'s loving wife and [[Bash Johnson]]'s mother. She is supportive of her husband destroying [[Randy Cunningham|the ninja]], though she is blissfully unaware that her son is the biggest bully in school even when she and Hannibal are often called in by [[Principal Slimovitz]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Marci has a bit of a Canadian or Upper Midwestern American accent, although it's unknown if it means she's Canadian or from one of the North-Central American states such as Minnesota or Wisconsin, don'tcha know?\n**Marci's landing in a barrel of cheese in \"[[When Howie Met Randy]]\" may be an oblique reference to Wisconsin, whose inhabitants are known as \"cheeseheads.\"\n*Marci is the only mother of a character who has appeared in the show (unlike Bucky's mom, who has only been heard).\n**She is also one of the few wives to appear in the show.\n*She has gotten angry at McFist twice so far. The first time was in \"Bash Johnson: 11th Grade Ninja\" (although it is indicated by McFist and not actually shown) and the second time was \"Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes\" when Hannibal refrains from asking anyone to save Bash.\n*Marci is one of the few people in Norrisville who knows McFist is evil besides Viceroy, Randy, and Howard.\n*Even though Bash has seen while not put together that McFist is out to get the Ninja, Marci tries to hide the truth by covering Bash's ears when the Ninja reveals McFist's true nature.\n*Despite Marci's being McFist's wife, neither of them our ever seen wearing wedding rings\n*Bash is actually McFist's stepson; Marci's first husband has still never been seen or heard.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLast Stall on the Left - Marci and McFist 00.jpg\nLast Stall on the Left - Marci and McFist 01.jpg\nLast Stall on the Left - Marci and McFist 02.jpg\nLast Stall on the Left - Marci.jpg\nBash09.png\nLast Stall on the Left - Principal Slimovitz 00.png\nLast Stall on the Left - Bash 03.jpg\nLast Stall on the Left - Marci 00.jpg\nLast Stall on the Left - Best Wife.jpg\nLast Stall on the Left - Marci and McFist.png\nMcFists of Fury - Principal Slimovitz, McFist and Marci.png\nHannibal&Marci02.jpg\nHouse of 1,000 Boogers - Marci and McFist.png\nHouse of 1,000 Boogers - McFist 06.jpg\nHouse of 1,000 Boogers - Marci 00.jpg\nMarci in House of 1000 Boogers 5.png\nHouse of 1,000 Boogers - McFist 09.jpg\nHouse of 1,000 Boogers - McFist 11.jpg\nHouse of 1,000 Boogers - McFist 13.jpg\nHouse of 1,000 Boogers - Marci and McFist 00.jpg\nMC Fist family Portrait.png\nBash01.png\nAttack of the Killer Potatoes - Bash and McFist 00.jpg\nAttack of the Killer Potatoes - Bash and McFist 01.jpg\nAttack of the Killer Potatoes - Bash 00.jpg\nBash04.png\nDawn of driscoll4.jpg\nMcFreaks - Marci, Viceroy and McFist.png\nParty-McOne Armed and Dangerous.png\nMcOne Armed and Dangerous01.png\nBrolateralDamage - 679.jpg\nBrolateralDamage - 704.jpg\nHHHW - 819.jpg\nHHHW - 497.jpg\nHHHW - 304.jpg\nMarci stankdup.png|Marci Stanked up\nEscapefromScrapCity - 700.jpg\nMarci Model Sheet.jpg\nStanked Marci.jpg\nMarci in Winter Outfit.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McFist, Marci}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
