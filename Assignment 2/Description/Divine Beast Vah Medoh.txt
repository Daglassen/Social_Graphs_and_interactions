It is a giant machine that is in the shape of an eagle.\n\n==History==\nThe Divine Beast Vah Medoh was created over 10,000 years ago by the [[Sheikah]], along with the other three [[Divine Beast]]s and {{Plural|BotW|Guardian|link}}, to combat [[Calamity Ganon]].<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Red|four Divine Beasts}} are the ancient Sheikah weapons wielded by the four Champions who Ganon defeated.|Impa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|The people thought it wise to utilize their technological prowess to ensure the safety of the land, should Calamity Ganon ever return. They constructed four mechanical wonders to be known as the Divine Beasts.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Four [[Champion]]s were picked to pilot the Divine Beasts, who launched a full-scale attack on [[Ganon]],<ref>{{Cite|The Divine Beasts were piloted by four individuals of exceptional skill from across the land.

With their overwhelming technological might, their efforts were successful and Ganon was sealed away for a time.<ref>{{Cite|Upon Ganon's inevitable return to Hyrule, the princess and the hero fought alongside these four Champions against this ancient evil. The Guardians were tasked with protecting the hero as the Divine Beasts unleashed a furious attack upon their terrible foe. And when the hero wielding the sword that seals the darkness delivered his final blow... The princess used her sacred power to seal away Calamity Ganon.|Impa|BotW}}</ref>\n\n110 years before the events of {{BotW|-}}, the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]] was warned by a fortune teller of Ganon's return.<ref>{{Cite|Reports keep arriving regarding the excavation of relics. The fortune teller's predictions seem to be coming true. Calamity Ganon was not a figure of fable, or even of legend. He actually existed in our great land of Hyrule. We must investigate all the relics, learn as much as we can. But understanding the Divine Beasts alone will take time... Zelda's eyes lit up like a wildfire when I told her about the relics... I must admit, she has a knack for research.|King Rhoam's Journal|BotW}}</ref><!-- How do we know this was 110 years before the events of BotW and not longer? --> In preparation of Ganon's return, the Divine Beasts were rediscovered after being excavated and four Champions were chosen to pilot them.<ref>{{Cite|But there was also...a prophecy. \"The signs of a resurrection of Calamity Ganon are clear. And the power to oppose it lies dormant beneath the ground.\" We decided to heed the prophecy and began excavating large areas of land. It wasn't long before we discovered several ancient relics made by the hands of our distant ancestors. These relics, the Divine Beasts, were giant machines piloted by warriors.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> The [[Rito]] Champion, [[Revali]], was chosen to operate Medoh.{{Fact}} It was also during this time that Medoh served as the protector of the Rito people of [[Rito Village]].{{Fact}} However, despite [[Princess Zelda]]'s and the Champions' best effort, Ganon surprised them by corrupting and taking control of the Divine Beasts and Guardians.<ref>{{Cite|The princess, her appointed knight, and the rest of the Champions were on the brink of sealing away Ganon... But nay... Ganon was cunning, and he responded with a plan beyond our imagining. He appeared from deep below Hyrule Castle, seized control of the Guardians and the Divine Beasts, and turned them against us.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> Revali was killed by [[Windblight Ganon]], a being created by Ganon to seize control of Medoh.<ref>{{Cite|Good Luck! That thing is one of Ganon's own, and it plays dirty!

Those residing in the castle as well. The appointed knight, gravely wounded, collapsed while defending the princess... And thus, the kingdom of Hyrule was devastated absolutely by Calamity Ganon. However... The princess survived...to face Ganon alone.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref>\n\nA century later, Ganon's power grew strong enough to remotely control the Divine Beasts once more even in his imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite|Somehow, Ganon has maintained control over all four Divine Beasts, as well as those Guardians swarming around Hyrule Castle.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref>\u00a0Under his control, Medoh flies over Rito Village\u00a0in the [[Hebra]] Region, threatening the inhabitants of Rito Village with the fear of being shot down by its cannons if they fly too high.{{Fact}} This continues until Link arrives and subsequently liberates Medoh from Ganon.\n\n===Minor Enemies===\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Cursed Bokoblin Model.png|[[Cursed Bokoblin]]\nFile:BotW Cursed Lizalfos Model.png|[[Cursed Lizalfos]]\nFile:BotW Cursed Moblin Model.png|[[Cursed Moblin]]\nFile:BotW Malice Model.png|[[Pool of Malice]]\nFile:BotW Guardian Scout II Model.png|[[Guardian Scout II]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ===\nThe first mention of Medoh is when Zelda and Link go to the [[Hebra]] region to ask Revali to pilot it.
