He is burly with a beard and wears a helmet. The Gizzardgulper is also the only man-eating giant to wear long pants rather than a cloth or shorts and is shorter than the rest of the tribe, standing 39 feet tall. He is the \"jock\" of the group.\n\nHe, along with the [[Fleshlumpeater]], [[Bloodbottler]], [[Meatdripper]], [[Manhugger]], [[Maidmasher]], [[Bonecruncher]], [[Childchewer]], and [[Butcherboy|Butcher Boy]] enjoy snatching and gobbling up little children at night while [[The BFG (character)|The BFG]] delivers dreams to the children.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:The BFG characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
