During the day, he can found sitting in one of its {{Plural|BotW|Hot Spring|link}}. When he's sitting in the Spring, Duby's mouth is underwater, which gargles his words.<ref>{{Cite|If goo gotz, den ged oudda gear!|Dugby|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Bobah! Bah!!|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> If Link swings his weapon around Dugby, he will be yelled at for doing something dangerous.<ref>{{Cite|What are ya doin'! That's dangerous!|Dubgy|BotW}}</ref> At night, he sleeps nearby.\n\nDugby competes with his grandfather, {{Term|BotW|Grapp|link}}, to see who can stay in the Spring the longest.<ref name=\"Gramps\"/><ref>{{Cite|Me un Gramps are seebee who can bay in da bot bing da bombest! So, I'm binda biddy ride now!|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> However, he's unable to do so, and decides to go to sleep and beat his grandfather another day.<ref>{{Cite|I'm goin' to sleep... I'll beat Gramps tomorrow... Yeah, I'm sure of it...|Dugby|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Dugby is in the water, he'll tell {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} about the treasure that he buried near the {{Term|BotW|Bridge of Eldin|link}}, with the promise that Link can keep it if he finds it.<ref>{{Cite|I bid a {{Color|BotW Red|tweshure}} binteen gear an ba {{Color|BotW Blue|Bridge of Eldin}}! Iz an abazing schtick! Beely bool! If boo bind it... iz boars!|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> However, because Dugby's mouth is submerged underwater when spoken to, his directions to the treasure come out as gurgles.<ref>{{Cite|Bello! Goo gon't go but I'm thaying?|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> This initiates the {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}} {{Term|BotW|Death Mountain's Secret|link}}.

Although amazed that Link found the treasure, Dugby is skeptic about it and checks the Weapon to determine if it is the same Drillshaft he buried,<ref>{{Cite|Hey! Don't tell me that stick is... [...] That's the {{Color|BotW Blue|drillshaft}} I hid! ...Right? Actually, I need to get a better look at it. Show it me! NOW!|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> and confirms that it is the same one.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I guess so. It's suspicious though! I can't help thinkin' that's the {{Color|BotW Blue|drillshaft}} I hid... <small>There's no mistakin' it... There was definitely a big noise...

So you went and found the {{Color|BotW Blue|drillshaft}} I hid.|Dugby|BotW}}</ref> True to his word, he lets Link keep the Drillshaft as a reward for finding it.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Goron|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Goron Hot Springs|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Death Mountain's Secret|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Grapp|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gorons, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
