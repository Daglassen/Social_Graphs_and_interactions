You can't change the past, only the future. {{Color|BotW Blue|Harry}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|Mary}} never made it back, but two of their descendants are in that stall over there. My only friends out in these parts were horses, you see. I suppose that's still true to this day.|Monkton|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n{{Term|BotW|Harry (Breath of the Wild)}} was a male {{Term|BotW|Horse|link}} who lived at {{Term|BotW|Snowfield Stable|link}} with his mate {{Term|BotW|Mary (Breath of the Wild)|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Monkton|link}} when he was a child. {{Term|BotW|Monkton}} was an adventurous child and, as there were no other children around for him to play with, he befriended {{Term|BotW|Harry (Breath of the Wild)}} and {{Term|BotW|Mary (Breath of the Wild)}} and took them with him on his adventures. One day, while exploring the {{Term|BotW|North Lomei Labyrinth|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Monkton}} sent {{Term|BotW|Harry (Breath of the Wild)}} into the maze as a test of courage, but he never returned.\n\n{{Term|BotW|Harry (Breath of the Wild)}} and {{Term|BotW|Mary (Breath of the Wild)}}'s descendants currently live in the stalls next to {{Term|BotW|Snowfield Stable}}, where they are looked after by an elderly {{Term|BotW|Monkton}} who is determined to take better care of them than he did with their ancestors.\n\n==Trivia==\n*{{Term|BotW|Harry (Breath of the Wild)}} and his mate {{Term|BotW|Mary (Breath of the Wild)|link}} are likely a reference to {{Term|ST|Harry (Spirit Tracks)|link}} and {{Term|ST|Mary (Spirit Tracks)|link}}, a husband and wife from {{ST}}.\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Horses, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
