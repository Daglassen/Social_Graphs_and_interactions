He's greedy, obsessive, arrogant and selfish. While on the way to Hollywood, the Goat Man picks [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] up for a ride, but the Goat Man also kidnaps Mickey as his own stuff. In the van, [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] and [[Mortimer Mouse|Mortimer]] are kidnapped as well and the Goat Man brings them to his own house with all sorts of junk around. In order to get out of the Goat Man's house, Mickey tells Mortimer to do the show for him, but Mickey's sneaky idea is how to be lousy in the show. Mortimer convinces the Goat Man to watch the show\u2014if he's funny, he gets to keep them. When the show is over, while Mickey did some lousy things to Mortimer in the end, the Goat Man wants to keep Mortimer instead of Mickey and Minnie.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGoatman and Mortimer.png\nGoat Man.jpg|Goat man thinking like maybe about the choice of mickey and friends to leave or stay after they start the show.\nGoat man in the van.png|Goat Man pulled in to pick up Mickey\nGoat man's devilish look.png|Antagonistic Goat Man\nGoat Man's Manor.png|Goat Man's Lair\nGoat Man sitting on his throne.png|Impatient Goat Man\nImg8C14.jpg|\"Listen, horn boy, we appreciate the ride, but this place's disgusting and we're doing Hollywood!\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
