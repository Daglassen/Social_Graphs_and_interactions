"\n[[File:JerrythePlatypus.jpg|thumb|200px|Jerry the Platypus drooling with an agent hat on]]'''Jerry the Platypus''' is a minor antagonist of the animated TV show, ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. He was the first [[Wikipedia:doppelganger|doppelganger]] of [[Perry the Platypus]] to roll off the Platyproliferatorinator built by [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] with the intention of discrediting and annihilating [[Perry the Platybus|Agent P]]. Despite that he was a failure, Doofenshmirtz mentions to have found him too cute to be able to dispose of. Jerry carries around a metal pipe which he chews on and often employs as a melee weapon against people and objects around him without warning.\n\nHe wasn't capable of physically confronting [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]] as the other clones were so instead of participating in the fight he sat in a lounge chair along with Doofenshmirtz and watched as the platypus fought for his life. He was eventually destroyed when Perry leaped onto his lounge chair, flinging him at the \"reverse\" button of the Platyproliferatorinator and causing it to suck him along with all of the other clones in and eventually exploding.\n\nIn spite of his demise by the end of \"[[Cheer Up Candace]]\" he makes an appearance in the supposed preview of a disputed Chronicles of Meap sequel known as \"Meap Me in St. Louis\". He also appeared in the \"[[Carpe Diem]]\" segment in \"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Cheer Up Candace]]''\n*''[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]'' (Cameo)\n*''[[Meapless in Seattle]]'' (cameo) \u00a0\u00a0\n\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Platypuses]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
