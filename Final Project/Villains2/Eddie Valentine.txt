In [[1938]], [[Neville Sinclair]]\u00a0hired him and his gang to obtain the rocket from Howard Hughes. He does not like Neville much, but does the job for the money. After their first attempt is stopped by the FBI, he demands that Neville triple his price for getting the rocket.\n\nWhen Sinclair learns that Cliff Secord has the rocket, Eddie sends his men to get the rocket. This ultimately leads Cliff to the [[South Seas Club|South Seas Night Club]] which the ensuing melee trashes. However, during the melee, Sinclair kidnaps Secord's girlfriend, Jenny Blake. Sinclair sends an ultimatum to Secord: Come to the Griffith Observatory alone and give them the rocket or Blake dies.\u00a0\n\nSecord arrives at the rendezvous as demanded. When he shows reluctance to hand it over first Eddie tells him to just give it to them \"So we can all go home.\" Cliff turns to him and asks him \"What's it like working for a Nazi, Eddie?\" and asks if Neville is paying him in American dollars or German Marks. Eddie turns to Neville and asks him what is Cliff talking about and Cliff reveals what he learned from the FBI: That Eddie's gang are hired muscle for a Nazi Spy Ring that Sinclair is part of, a claim Jenny backs up. Sinclair reminds him he's paying him a fortune and therefore from his point of view it shouldn't matter to him who he's working for but Eddie says \"It matters to me.\", and states that while he may be a gangster he's not a traitor and tells Neville to let Jenny go. He and his men then help the FBI attack the Nazis.\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"You will triple my price.\"\n*\"[[Neville Sinclair|Number three jerk]]!\"\n*\"It matters to me. I may not make an honest buck, but I'm 100% American. I don't work for no two-bit Nazi.\"\n*\"Go get 'em, [[Cliff Secord|kid]].\" (his last words)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSinclar Threatening Valentine.jpg|Neville threatening Eddie\nValentine.jpg|\"You will triple my price.\"\n</gallery>\n{{The Rocketeer}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Rocketeer characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]"
