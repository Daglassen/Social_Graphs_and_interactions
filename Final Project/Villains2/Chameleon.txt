Much of the time, an imperfect transformation can give him away. Also, he ends up wasting his powers a lot by doing corny impressions of human celebrities (whenever he does that he retains his green skin). At times, he is capable of transforming into a large reptilian form rivaling [[Siege]] or [[Check \"Grin\" Hardwing|Grin]] in strength. [[Lord Dragaunus|Dragaunus]] has little patience for his antics and stupidity. The most effective uses of his powers has been in his impersonations of the Ducks and other humans, which comes in handy the most for such tasks as infiltration, sabotage, and espionage.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Lizards]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
