She owns a pet Chihuahua named Zeus, which she loves. She doesn't like reptiles due to the fact that she's afraid of them and that Mr. Kipling liked the taste of her and she even tried to have Mr. Kipling removed from the building after she found out he was living there; however, when a hawk tried to attack her Chihuahua, Mr. Kipling saved the dog's life by swatting the bird away with his tail. Afterward, she decided to allow Mr. Kipling to stay.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She enjoys watching ''[[Wikipedia:The Real Housewives of New York|The Real Housewives of New York]]''.\n*She hates large reptiles, such as Mrs. Kipling. However, since Mr. Kipling saved her dog's life, she tolerates his presence.\n*She and her dog have cheat days, where they allow themselves to eat junk food.

She called her, Marla.\n*She wants Jessie to keep Zuri away from her as she seemed strange when Zuri tried to keep Ms. Chesterfield from finding Mr. Kipling.\n*Her fear of reptiles is similar to [[Captain Hook]]'s fear of [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile]].\n*She's been married at least twice.\n*Had broken a tooth in \"The Talented Mr. Kipling\".\n*Has called animal control before.\n*She is 32 years old (though most likely older).\n*She also calls Bertram, \"Bertie\", as a pet name.\n*She is not a natural redhead.\n*She thinks [[Wikipedia:Anderson Cooper|Anderson Cooper]] is hot. (\"Are You Cooler Than a 5th Grader?\")\n*She is very sarcastic saying she was going to suggest going ballroom dancing when Tony said not to move and congratulating Jessie for knowing her own name in Glue Dunnit.\n*One of her dreams is diamond rain (another one is to see [[Wikipedia:Matt Lauer|Matt Lauer]] in the sauna) (\"Romancing the Crone\")\n*She had some similarities to [[Cruella De Vil]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chesterfield, Rhoda}}\n{{Jessie}}\n[[Category:Jessie characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
