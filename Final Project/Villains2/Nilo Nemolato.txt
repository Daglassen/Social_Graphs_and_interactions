Operating out of a clean boathouse with a small fleet of nice red and white steamer boats, the popularity and prosperity of Nilo's operation has driven Frank into significant financial debt to him, with his parrot [[Rosita]] often squawking the phrase \"Frank owes me money!\". When Nilo repossesses the engine of the ''La Quila'', Frank sneaks into his office to steal the keys to get it back, meeting [[Lily Houghton]] in the process and convincing her that he is Nilo. When the ruse is exposed in the cantina below, Frank offers a lower price then Nilo for passage down river. When the Houghtons are followed by the forces of Prince Joaquim and his submarine, their escape from town with Frank ends up resulting in the destruction of Nilo's boathouse. \n\nWhen the expedition returns from the long journey down river on the cobbled-together scraps of the ''La Quila'', Frank declares that Nilo can finally own what's left of his boat when meeting him at the dock.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Film ===\n\n==== Jungle Cruise ====\n\n=== Disney Parks ===\n\n==== [[Jingle Cruise]] ====\nIn the 2021 Jungle Cruise, a crate reading, \"Nilo Nemolato\" was amongst the dumped Christmas cargo nearby the marooned passengers of the Kwango Kate in the African veldt.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Nilo's pet cockatoo Rosita is a character originating from [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]] and who physically appears in Disneyland's [[Jungle Cruise]] and [[The Tropical Hideaway|Tropical Hideaway]].\n*Originally, the filmmakers planned on giving Nilo a pet monkey before opting for a bird due to it being easier to work with.\n*Nilo's office door resembles those seen on the upper floor of the [[Skipper Canteen]].
