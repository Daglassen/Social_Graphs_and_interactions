Sky Octoroks are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Skyward Sword ===
Sky Octoroks only appear in the Sky in Skyward Sword. They fly using the leaves on their mantles and live on the small, barren rock islands scattered throughout the Sky. As Link flies his Loftwing, Sky Octoroks will fire homing rocks at him. They can be defeated by flying close and boosting through them with a Spiral Charge.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Sky Octoroks only appear in Master Mode included in DLC Pack 1, The Master Trials, in Breath of the Wild. They can be found all around Hyrule soaring through the skies next to bridges and Sheikah Towers, or above bodies of water. Sky Octoroks appear in groups of three or four holding planks containing Treasure Chests, and enemies. They ascend when they hear a Bokoblin Horn or Link  whistling. Sky Octoroks can be defeated with a single Arrow, dropping the contents of their planks when defeated. They are harmless to Link as they cannot attack like other Octoroks. Unlike other enemies, Sky Octoroks do not need the Blood Moon to respawn and do not drop Materials when defeated.
