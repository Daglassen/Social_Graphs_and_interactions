== Biography ==
Dunma is a guard of a guard to Zora's Domain who wields a Zora Spear. She is the daughter of Rivan and the granddaughter of Trello. She's offended when Link asks her age, though she clarifies that she's less than 100 years old.
When Rivan gets carried away speaking to Link, Dunma interrupts to remind him that they're on duty. She notes how excited Rivan was to see him. Since it's their first time meeting, she introduce herself to Link. Link asks if she's female, to which Dunma comments on how observant he is.
Dunma believes herself to be less formal than the Zora elders. She explains to Link that Zora's Domain is looking for a Hylian and instructs him to meet with King Dorephan for more information.
Link can ask Dunma about King Dorephan, who she'll reveal is the ruler of Zora's Domain and the father of Sidon and Mipha. She gives him directions to the Throne Room and reminds him to mind his manners. According to her, Sidon is very socialable and popular among the younger Zora. However, this isn't understood by the Zora elders.
After Divine Beast Vah Ruta has been calmed, Dunma tells Link that it's been some time since Zora's Domain has seen the sun. She wonders if Ruta has stopped spouting water. Once Link has received the Lightscale Trident, Dunma calls him no ordinary man and says he'll always be welcome in Zora's Domain.
