When Teamo attempts to stop him, he and his valet, Cosmo, shrink them with his Reduct-o-Ray. With Teamo detained, Minutia makes his way to the state capitol and also uses his Reduct-o-Ray on [[Governor Kevin]] and [[the Chief]]. However, he and Cosmo have a hard time finding the entrance to Level 7, to the point that Teamo manages to make it to the capitol and send in [[Captain Crandall|Crandall]]'s dog, [[Action]], to distract them. Before Minutia and Cosmo can figure it out, Teamo turns the Reduct-o-Ray on them.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMinutia_eating_sandwich.jpg\nDrMinutia2.jpg|Dr. Minutia and Cosmo having just shrunk Teamo.\nDrMinutia3.jpg\nDrMinutia4.jpg\nDrMinutia11.jpg\nDrMinutia5.jpg\nDrMinutia6.jpg\nDrMinutia7.jpg\nDrMinutia8.jpg\nDrMinutia9.jpg\nDrMinutia10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minutia}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]"
