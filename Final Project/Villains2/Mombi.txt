She is inspired by the witch of the same name from the second Oz book and Princess Langwidere from the third Oz book. She wears a red and gold dress that spikes out at the top. She constantly put on different heads from her collection, which belonged to other statues. A red key is used to unlock the cabinets in which she stores them. One time, she asks for [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s and decides to lock her in her tower until it looks old enough to wear (due to her only being 11 in the film). There, she meets [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], who reveals that one cabinet holds her real head with the Powder of Life.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTumblr ndxjg89TDq1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nmandolin_rto.jpg\nreturn2bto2boz2bmombi.jpg\ntumblr_m3yp4nQiXE1rscakvo1_1280.jpg\ntumblr_mu6pdxSDim1qd5ug4o1_1280.jpg\nReturn to Oz Mombi Preview Poster.jpg|Mombi on a poster\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Oz}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Return to Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
