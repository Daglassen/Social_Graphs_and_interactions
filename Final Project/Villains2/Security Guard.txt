He and the rest of the team are criminals who were planning on dumping chemicals in the ocean. \n\nHe appeared when\u00a0Adam\u00a0and\u00a0Chase\u00a0went on a mission to collect chemical samples to bust criminals. He was shown carrying around pepper spray (most likely for self defense), though he got confused thinking it was breath spray. When he catches Adam and Chase, he calls for help.\n\nWhen the rest of the security guards come in, he asks Chase how they knew they were dumping chemicals into the ocean, unknowingly revealing it (though Adam and Chase already knew). Later,\u00a0Donald\u00a0comes to rescue them in a\u00a0Cyber-Mask. Adam hits Davenport, making him blow his cover. The Security Guard then orders his team to attack them. He was last seen hiding behind a pole and spraying his pepper spray. He and the other crooks were arrested after their alarms tipped of the police.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Lab Rats characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
