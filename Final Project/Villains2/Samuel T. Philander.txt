Philander''' is a recurring antagonist\u00a0in ''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''.\n\nHe is [[Archimedes Q. Porter|Professor Archimedes]]' academic rival who frequently attempts to steal his ideas or garner fame by turning [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] in as the \"missing link\". He was voiced by [[Craig Ferguson]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nAs mentioned before, Philander is an arrogant, rude, mean, cruel, careless, and selfish man and has a maddeningly superior attitude. He behaves like he is the better scientist than Professor Porter when he clearly is not. He also seems to be a bit paranoid, as evidenced by his misguided belief that Porter had not returned from Africa because of a new discovery he made.\n==Appearances==\n\n===The Legend of Tarzan===\nOn one occasion, he found [[Pellucidar]] yet his photographic proof about dinosaurs' existence was ruined by [[Baby Baboon|Manu]] photographing himself. He even tried to capture the silver ape, [[Mangani]], who is known for his healing powers. Samuel even tried to capture Tarzan and his men mistook Archimedes as him. His humiliations reduced him to living in an apartment in Chicago constantly ducking the Landlord when he was visited by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] about what he knows about Tarzan.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Tarzan and the Hidden World===\n<gallery>\nPhilander - Hidden World1.jpg|Philander in ''Tarzan and the Hidden World''.\nPhilander - Hidden World2.jpg|Philander confronted by [[Archimedes Q.
