Driven by ambitiousness and having been raised by villainous parents for all of her life, she served as a major antagonist in the series until her arrest in \"[[The Magic Within]]\" and subsequent reformation in \"[[The Lightning Warrior]]\".\n\n\n\n==Background==\n\n======<big>Physical Appearance</big>======\nCarla has long brown hair which she ties in a milkmaid braid, purple eyes, and honey skin. When first introduced, she wore a yellow dress, a green necklace and earrings, and an orange ribbon braided in her hair. When she is turned into a Malvago, her outfit changes into a purple robe with a spider design on the front, back, and sleeves, her necklace and earrings become purple, and her hair ribbon turns purple too.\n\n===Personality===\nLike her father, she is extremely ruthless as shown when she does anything to help her father get what he wants and doesn't care who she hurts to ensure this. Being a teenager, she also frequently shows the awkwardness that can accompany being at that age, plus other signs of immaturity such as a bad temper, and is also very spoiled. Despite her flaws and maliciousness, Carla does care about her family, as she is loyal to her father, joins her mother in a loving embrace when they are reunited, and expresses delight over her parents being together again (though she is unaware that her parents are actually at odds with each other and are hiding their mutual discontent from Carla).\n\nAfter Victor is turned into stone by [[Ash Delgado|Ash]], Carla cries over his petrified body and refuses to go with her mother, effectively disowning her. As she is being arrested again, Carla sadly tells [[Princess Elena|Elena]] that she thought her mother cared about her and her father, but she was wrong; this not only proves Carla's capacity for maturity, but helps her and Elena relate to each other (Elena having been wrong about Esteban) despite them being enemies. She even begs Elena to restore her father, promising she'll do anything Elena asks.\n\nCarla is afraid of thunderstorms, as she fearfully clutches Victor in her arms when [[Four Shades of Awesome|Hetz]] conjures one. Additionally after joining Team Avalor, she finally respects Mateo enough to get his name right, and develops a new sense of loyalty and kindness towards Elena and Avalor.\n\n==Role in the series==\nCarla first appears in \"[[King of the Carnaval]]\" when she and her father arrive at Avalor Palace to steal the Crown Jewels of Avalor. After getting [[Elena Flores|Elena]] to show them the Royal Treasury of Avalor, Carla steals the key from a sentry and gives it to her father. As per the plan, Carla keeps the Royal Family distracted by helping them with their Carnaval Float. After Victor blackmails [[Chancellor Esteban]] into helping them, Carla is surprised when it's Elena who comes out with the jewels. Victor has Esteban get them back and Victor takes control of the float to give the Royal Family a bumpy ride. When Esteban comes back with the jewels, Carla notes that Esteban doesn't have the tiara to which Esteban explains that Elena's wearing it. Victor tells Carla to get rid of the others which she does by unhooking the float. Carla then takes the tiara from Elena who Victor imprisons along with Esteban. However, their escape is stalled by the Carnaval Parade long enough for Elena and Esteban to initiate a chase. They are soon apprehended by the Avalorans and banished from Avalor forever by Elena. However, Victor assures her they will find a way to return for the tiara.\n\nShe returned in ''[[Realm of the Jaquins]]'' alongside her father, who is now helping [[Shuriki]] in her plot to re-conqueror Avalor. Between \"[[The Jewel of Maru]]\" and \"[[Royal Rivalry]]\", Carla, along with Victor becomes a wanted criminal. In \"[[A Spy in the Palace]]\" Shuriki gives Carla a potion to make her look like a stranger. Following their plans, Carla takes the name Rita and pretends to be [[Armando]]'s 'cousin'. She tries to sabotage Naomi's festival planning. She tries to make off with [[King Raul and Queen Lucia|Queen Lucia's]] Carnaval tiara again but fails. However, she does not get caught, staying in the palace under her Rita guise and awaiting the next opportunity to steal the tiara.\n\nV\u00ecctor and Carla are turned into malvagos by [[Fiero]] in \"[[The Race for the Realm]]\" and continue to serve Shuriki until her death in \"[[Song of the Sirenas]]\". They are reunited with Carla's mother [[Ash Delgado]] in \"[[Snow Place Like Home]]\", with Carla ecstatic that they have become a happy family again.\n\nIn \"[[Naomi Knows Best]]\", Victor, Ash, and Carla set up a trap for Elena by having a brainwashed [[King Joaqu\u00edn]] write a forged letter to her, lying that Victor and Carla have been captured in his kingdom. Once Elena arrives there with Esteban and Mateo, Ash reveals herself and imprisons Esteban, Mateo, and Joaqu\u00edn in a cell. She and her family plan to extract the magic inside Elena into the Scepter of Night's jewel, which will kill her, and use a spell on Elena that forces her to go with them. Gabe and Naomi ambush them, but Ash is easily able to defeat them and plans to have Carla perform the magical spell with her, as she is a more powerful malvago than Victor, much to Victor's frustration, whom Ash entrusts with guarding the cells.\n\nBy the evening, Ash and Carla have tied up Elena aboard a ship, and once the full moon arrives, they begin performing the spell. When she hears a noise, Carla goes outside to check, where Mateo, Naomi, and Gabe defeat her and steal her tamborita. Mateo also manages to destroy the Scepter of Night's jewel before Ash can finish performing the spell. Ash tries to blast Mateo, but he is able to shield himself and Carla from her attack. In spite of her failure and the loss of her and Carla's tamboritas, Ash escapes with Carla by jumping into the water below. Carla is unwilling to leave Victor (who had been imprisoned for his crimes) behind, but Ash assures her that they'll come back for him eventually.\n\nIn \"[[Sister of Invention]]\", she gets to meet her mother's mentor: Zopilote, who gives the two of them a puzzle map to Takaina, where they can have access to extremely powerful magical artifacts. Afterwards, in \"[[To Save a Sunbird]]\", Carla gets frustrated with her mother's efforts to solve the puzzle map to Takaina and attempts to rescue her father herself, but fails and gets imprisoned in the dungeon of Avalor Castle with him.\n\nIn \"[[The Magic Within]]\", Carla is reunited with Ash once more when she gets captured upon her arrival to Takaina. When Esteban's betrayal is revealed, he gets imprisoned in a cell near the one containing Carla and her parents. Ash and Carla mock Esteban, but he is confident his family will forgive him. When this does not happen and Esteban is sentenced to banishment after the Carnaval parade, he escapes from the dungeon by tricking Higgins into unknowingly giving him the key before distracting him. Following his escape, Esteban refuses to help the Delgados, but Ash reminds him that he needs them because he won't stand a chance against Elena and Mateo.\n\nOnce the Delgados and Esteban are all free from the dungeon, Esteban gives Carla and her parents back their tamboritas by sneaking into the treasury room and taking them. The four of them escape the palace, but Elena, who found out about what happened and is now chasing them with Canela, panics and her magic unintentionally causes an avalanche that knocks Carla and Esteban off a cliff. Though Carla nearly falls to her death, Ash saves her but shows significantly less concern for her safety than Victor (who was unable to save Carla due to his tamborita being destroyed), while Esteban manages to climb back up. Victor refuses to go with Ash over fear for Carla's safety, resulting in her turning him into stone, which leaves Carla heartbroken. In tears of rage and anguish at her mother's betrayal of ''familia'', Carla refuses to go with her mother, though Esteban does over fear for what she would do to him if he doesn't.\n\nAfterwards, Carla and a petrified Victor are captured by Mateo, Gabe, and other guards. When asked about what happened to Victor, Carla solemnly reveals what her mother did and states she thought she loved her and her father, but she was wrong. Elena expresses sympathy for Carla, stating she knows how it feels to be wrong about family. Carla begs Elena to save Victor, saying she'll do anything Elena asks, although Elena simply tells Carla she will deal with her later as Carla is led back to Avalor Palace so she can be put back in the dungeon, with a look of absolute remorse and sadness on her face as Gabe takes her back to be re-imprisoned.\n\nIn \"[[Captain Mateo]]\", [[Do\u00f1a Paloma]] states that the only reason Carla was captured is because she gave up. In \"[[Spirit of a Wizard]]\", Ash tells Esteban he needs to get Elena back for what she did to Carla.\n\nShe returns in \"[[The Lightning Warrior]]\". Together with her father Victor after he is restored to flesh and blood after being petrified by Ash some time ago, Elena gives the two a chance to redeem themselves for their past crimes with Shuriki, Fiero, and Ash by helping her with a mission to free an ancient [[Ixlan|Maruvian warrior]], she and her [[Victor Delgado|father]] reformed and became new members of Elena's squad. They are no longer Malvogos at this point.\n\nIn \"[[Coronation Day]]\", Victor and Carla show up when Elena and her friends are about to go off and confront Ash's villainous group, declaring their intention to come along. Elena asks them if they are sure they want to, since Ash will be there, to which Carla reminds her they told her they would help her defend Avalor, and meant it. At this, Elena gives Victor a look of respect and touches Carla's shoulder, and all of them depart.\n\nDuring the battle against the villains, Carla expresses concern for Mateo when Ash and then [[Chatana]] blast him, and he is pleased she got his name right. At one point, Ash blasts Elena, when suddenly she is confronted by Victor and Carla, who point their tamboritas at her. Though she barely acknowledges Victor's presence, Ash is shocked Carla would do such a thing, only for Carla to retort that she turned Victor into stone. Ash insists she loves Carla more than anyone or anything, but Victor tells her she loves herself more. Upon failing to convert Carla to her side, Ash dares her to give it her best shot, but Carla finds herself unable to blast Ash. Victor attempts to blast her anyway, but she dodges it and casts a spell that sends him relentlessly spinning as Carla chases after him. With her family out of the way, Ash is given the opportunity to release the [[Four Shades of Awesome|Shadows of the Night]], only to end up falling into the Spirit World with Elena and Flo. Shortly after the Shades' release, one of them, Yolo the Animal Shade, turns Victor and Carla into peabunnies. When Team Avalor retreats, Naomi picks up the transformed Victor and Carla.\n\nAfter Elena's forgiveness towards a now redeemed Esteban creates a wave that undoes all the damage the Shades have done to Avalor, Victor and Carla are returned to normal. They meet up with everyone at the castle courtyard, where Elena and Esteban return to Avalor after sealing Cahu the Time Shade in the Spirit World. Now that peace has been restored, Elena proceeds with her coronation, with Victor and Carla being among the many attendants and bowing to Elena. They are also among the ones who give Naomi a smile of approval when Elena names her the new Chancellor, and quickly sing and dance with the others. While dancing, Carla bumps heads with Mateo, and the two exchange sheepish smiles while holding hands before continuing to celebrate Elena's new reign.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Carla's voice actress, [[Myrna Velasco]] previously worked on ''[[Descendants: Wicked World]]'' as the daughter of [[Captain Hook]], [[CJ Hook]].
