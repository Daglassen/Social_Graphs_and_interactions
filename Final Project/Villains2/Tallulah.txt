She is [[Crosby Strickler|Principal Strickler]]'s cat. She is one of the very few people that know Spot can talk and is [[Spot Helperman/Scott Leadready II|Scott Leadready II]]. When she is around Scott, she acts all hyper and hissy and tries to tell others he is a dog but they just cannot see the obvious.\n\n==Personality==\nWhen Strickler is around, she acts all sweet and playful, but when it comes to Scott, [[Leonard Helperman|Leonard]], and [[Pretty Boy]] she is evil and hyper. The most notable episodes that she talks are \"[[Tallulahpalooza]]\" and \"[[Saving Mr. Jolly]]\". She also knows that Scott is a dog and always tries to get people to notice as well. On most occasions, Tallulah has tried to eat Pretty Boy.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n333332221114.jpg\nScreen Shot 2013-02-25 at 10.06.50 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2013-04-15 at 9.16.44 AM.png\nScreen Shot 2013-04-15 at 9.16.07 AM.png\nScreen Shot 2013-04-23 at 7.35.43 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2013-03-16 at 10.08.47 AM.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Teacher's Pet}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tallulah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Teacher's Pet characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
