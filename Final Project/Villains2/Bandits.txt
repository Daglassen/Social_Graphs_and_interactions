They appear right when Mulan is about to tell Shang how she really feels about him and then they suddenly appear and ambush the cavalcade,(apparently trying to steal the princesses gold and jewels). Mulan, Shang, and the soldiers manage to hold them off for a while but they then capture Mei and run off with her and drag her across a rickety old bridge but she is rescued by Mulan and Shang. The bandits then start cutting the bridges ropes holding it up causing it to collapse and then run off. They are not seen or mentioned again after this.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Mulan}}\n[[Category:Mulan characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
