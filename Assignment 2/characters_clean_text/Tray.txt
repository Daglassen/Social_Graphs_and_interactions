== Biography ==
Tray is the innkeeper of the Rollin' Inn in Goron City, which he runs alongside Volcon. Tray manages the Inn's front desk, where he offers customers a bed or a Goron-style massage at a cost. Tray highly recommends the Goron massages, which Volcon gives, stating that it rejuvenates the body and admitting that he even sometimes falls asleep during it.
Since Tray does not go outside, he is not bothered by the Divine Beast Vah Rudania's Magma Bombs.
