drawn the same artstyle Pac Man all the video game characters and elements that appear the film the Mario Sonic the Hedgehog Street Fighter Bert Tapper Altered Beast and Pong characters are the only ones who are all drawn very accurate their games official artwork While Kano sports the red eye like his Mortal Kombat counterpart his appearance the game doesn have the mechanical right arm Also most noticeably Clyde looks more like his game sprite rather than his official artwork seen the game Pac Man World which looks like this similar treatment was done the other three ghosts with Pac Man himself Zangief actually portrayed Bad Guy this film similar his appearances the live action Street Fighter film and animated series but not the games storyline According screenwriter Phil Johnston the reason for Zangief villainy was due the fact that found him very hard beat when playing Street Fighter boy and personally considered him villain Johnston also maintains that Zangief high
