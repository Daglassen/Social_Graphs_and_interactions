He told his master he caught [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]] and her friends snooping around, Gadget told the tribe that they weren't snooping, they were just lost.\n\nHe tampered with the Gyromobile and made it go crazy. He took Gadget as a hostage and [[Chip and Dale|Chip]] explained to Gadget that Pop Top has been stealing the Cola Cult donations instead of fizzing them when it was actually Bubbles. Bubbles explained that Pop Top actually believed in all this soda silliness.\n\nBubbles said he was the one figured to profit buy it and that he was gonna take over the Cola Cult as their new leader. He thought he'd be rid of Gadget and her friends after he sabotaged her Gyromoblie and he told Gadget that she would never be able to ride in it again.\n\nGadget got away but he told his henchmen to never mind her and told them she wouldn't be back. He captured the rest of the Rangers and put them in soda bottles. He asked the others if they had any last requests. He told the Rangers \"hope they were thirsty because this time the trap door stays trapped just like them.\"\n\nHe told the Cola Cult members that their leader couldn't be there for their little sing along tonight. He told the members Pop Top won't miss the fizzing. After a battle with Bubbles, Gadget reveals to the member that Bubbles isn't one of them, he stole their donations in his secret hiding place, and after Bubbles is defeated, she frees the Rangers and Bubbles is arrested.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=150 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nChip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 214 The Case of the Cola Cult arsenaloyal - YouTube123.jpg|Bubbles' defeat\nChip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers.jpg|Comic book appearance\n</gallery>\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
