Jack's crew was victorious against the ambush until [[Blackbeard]] approaches the groups to which he hung all of the crewmen, alongside Garheng. Garheng and the rest of the crew later were let down to notice the Cook's punishment.\n\nIn a plan to to find a mermaid at [[Whitecap Bay]] and obtain her tears for the ritual, the crew manages to capture a surviving mermaid named \"[[Syrena]]\" after surviving a massive battle.
