'''for short) is a minor antagonist of the animated TV show ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.\n\n==History==\nHe was introduced (and currently only seen) in \"[[The Beak]]\". K.P.P. is a supervillain who never had a good day in his life and plans to destroy a superhero called \"The Beak\" ([[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] in a robotic suit) who is giving Danville \"the best day ever.\" He doesn't understand why people laugh at his name, which according to his native tongue, translates as \"the strong fist\" (or \"that strong fist\"). K.P.P. also has a habit of almost ending his sentences with the phrase \"thank you very much\". When The Beak reveals his true identity, his wife, who often complains about her husband's schemes, takes him away to \"take her shopping for more throwing chairs\" (which she uses on K.P.P.).\n\n==Allusions==\n*'''[[Spider-Man]]''' - When Khaka Peu Peu gives the Beak the choice to either save Isabella from falling or rescue the people from the falling billboard, it is a parody of the first ''Spider-Man'' movie when the [[Green Goblin]] gives Spider-Man a choice to either save Mary Jane from falling of the Brooklyn Bridge or save the children from the gondola with the broken cable.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His nagging wife is played by [[Christine Taylor]], the former wife of [[Ben Stiller]].\n*Khaka Pe\u00fc Pe\u00fc is said that his family's name, and showed that possibly his father (or grandfather), Gustav Khaka Pe\u00fc Pe\u00fc.\n*He is unaware as to why people laugh at his full name, which according to him translates from its native tongue as \"the strong fist\" or \"that strong fist\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nCandace and KPP.jpg|Candace and KPP\n</gallery>\n\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
