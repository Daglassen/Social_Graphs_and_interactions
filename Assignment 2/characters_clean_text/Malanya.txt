Malanya is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Malanya is the god who watches over the Horses of the world. He makes his home in the Faron Region in Malanya Spring near the Lake of the Horse God. When first visited, Malanya is found trapped inside a bud, requiring 1,000 Rupees to regain his power. Once paid, he will offer to revive any Horse killed during Link's quest for free once. Any other revival will cost him an Endura Carrot.
Malanya is usually calm and refined, though he will occasionally threaten Link if he believes the hero is mistreating Horses. However, he claims he is merely jesting.


== Trivia ==
Malanya's music theme is a combination of "Epona's Song" and the Great Fairy Fountain theme.
