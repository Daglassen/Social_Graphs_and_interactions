Kohm is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Kohm is a Gerudo who manages the Sand-Seal Rental Shop Northwest Booth. Her daughter, Frelly, trains the Sand Seals and manages the southeast booth of the Shop. If Link speaks to Kohm, she introduces herself and says that Link must be the Hylian that Frelly was talking about. Kohm explains that they rent out Sand Seals and that their business is thriving. Kohm also explains how much easier their Sand Seals are to ride than wild Sand Seals because they have been trained. Kohm offers Link a Sand Seal rental for 20 Rupees. If Link ends the conversation by saying "seal you later," Kohm is confused by his pun and questions if that is how younger people talk now.
