== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Snow Octoroks live on snow-covered land and can burrow through the snow. It hides within the snow and disguises itself as a patch of grass until someone comes within range of it, when it will spit snowballs at their target. If Link gets too close to a Snow Octorok, it hides in the snow to protect itself. Link can force them out of the snow by attacking the grass on their head while they are hiding. Link can also perform a Perfect Guard with any Shield to deflect their snowballs back at them.
