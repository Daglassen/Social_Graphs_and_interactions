Tamana is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Tamana is a timid, slightly forgetful woman who tends to a small Cucco farm in Hateno Village. Should Link approach her, she panics and threatens to call someone to remove him for trespassing. However, she is quick to apologize for her rash behavior, as she can see that Link is not a threatening person.  She realizes that she is talking randomly and mentions that her husband dislikes this habit. Tamana finally brings herself to simply ask Link to leave, giving him a Bird Egg as an apology for her words. 
If Link hangs around to speak to her further, she is not sure if she asked him to leave. Should Link admit that she did, she wonders why. However, if Link says he does not believe she did, she becomes confused. Tamana then admits that she is often dropping eggs, despite having been on the farm for a few years. In a joking mood, Tamana decides to reward Link with another Bird Egg for "correctly guessing" that she is clumsy. She then pauses, wondering if she was the one to answer the question. Link admits that she did and she tells him the benefits of using the egg in recipes. She then realizes that she gave the Bird Egg away instead of taking it to the East Wind for sale, which happens frequently. Although she admits that she does not like to sell the eggs, she knows her husband would never agree. Link can keep trying to speak to her, but Tamana wonders if he has somewhere else to be.
