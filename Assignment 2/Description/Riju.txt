When Link approaches Riju, she comments that he is yet another traveler and asks how he got in the palace.<ref>{{Cite|Yet another traveler... How did you get in here?|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Riju also mentions that Link is carrying something interesting, referring to his [[Sheikah Slate]].<ref>{{Cite|It seems you have something rather interesting there...|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Buliara will then stop Link and demand him to explain his business there.<ref name=\"Riju\"/> Riju will quickly tell Buliara to hold on, noticing that Link is more than a common traveler and asks for his name.<ref>{{Cite|Hold on, Buliara... This one appears to be more than a common traveler. There you\u2014what is your name?|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Link tells Riju his name and that he can calm the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, which has been recently threatening the people in [[Gerudo (Region)|Gerudo]] with its lightning.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}}, cloaked in a massive sandstorm, hurling lightning at any who dare approach.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Riju questions if Link is powerful enough to subdue a [[Divine Beast]].<ref>{{Cite|You think you have what it takes to subdue something so powerful as a Divine Beast?|Riju|BotW}}</ref> She soon notices the Sheikah Slate on Link's hip,<ref>{{Cite|What of the device on this one's hip?

Wait a moment... You're a voe!|Buliara|BotW}}</ref> Riju states that it is a great crime for a man to enter Gerudo Town, but Riju dismisses this with the Sheikah Slate being enough proof for her that Link is a Champion.<ref>{{Cite|A voe within our walls is a great crime. But a voe who is a {{Color|BotW Blue|Champion}}...|Riju|BotW}}</ref> She tells Link that they would never mistreat a friend of Lady [[Urbosa]] and that they are allies if he is here to help subdue Naboris.<ref>{{Cite|Well, we'd never mistreat a friend of {{Color|BotW Blue|Lady Urbosa}}.

An interesting suggestion. You see, there is only one thing in all of Hyrule that can withstand the {{Color|BotW Blue|lightning}} from {{Color|BotW  Blue|Naboris}}. The {{Color|BotW Red|Thunder Helm}}, a family heirloom and relic of the Gerudo. But as Buliara says, it was stolen from us.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Buliara tells Link that Captain [[Teake]] in the barracks nearby can tell him about the thieves who stole the Thunder Helm.<ref>{{Cite|Our soldiers can tell you all you need to know about the thieves who stole Lady Riju's heirloom. Head through this arch. It will lead you to the barracks.

This is probably the most discouraging event this town has ever seen...|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Riju believes that Urbosa and other ancestors are looking down on them with shame and wonders if her people can tell how powerless she is.<ref>{{Cite|I believe that Lady Urbosa and our other ancestors must be looking down on us with such shame right now.|Riju|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I wonder if my people can tell just how powerless their young ruler truly is...|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Buliara intervenes, telling Riju not to take it personally and that the soldiers and herself are to blame,<ref>{{Cite|My lady, do not take this crisis so personally! This failure rests entirely on myself and on the soldiers tasked with protecting the heirloom.|Buliara|BotW}}</ref> commenting that she should have been more vigilant.<ref>{{Cite|If only I'd been more vigilant...|Buliara|BotW}}</ref> Riju then tells Buliara that she does not need to beat herself up about it.<ref>{{Cite|You needn't beat yourself up in my stead, Buliara...|Riju|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce Link returns to Riju from the [[Yiga Clan Hideout]] with the Thunder Helm, she will tell him to meet her at the [[Lookout Post]] south of town to prepare for the attack on Naboris.<ref>{{Cite|I'll head out now. Let's meet up at the {{Color|BotW Red|lookout post}} {{Color|BotW Blue|south of town}}.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Before leaving, she mentions that the only way to get close to Naboris is by riding a {{Term|BotW|Sand Seal|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|There's only one way to get close to {{Color|BotW Blue|Naboris}}, and that's with the help of a {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seal}}.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> When Link arrives to the outpost, Riju will be there waiting for him, equipped with the Thunder Helm, and begins telling Link the plan to take down Naboris. She tells Link that Naboris draws energy from the ground, so they must damage its feet.<ref>{{Cite|Naboris draws energy from the ground to keep moving. If you damage the feet, I think you can stop it.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> She also instructs Link to stay close to her to avoid getting shocked by Naboris and gives him some [[Bomb Arrow]]s.<ref>{{Cite|You'll have to stay close if you don't want to be shocked.|Riju|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Here are some Gerudo {{Color|BotW Blue|bomb arrows}}. There aren't many, so be sure to put them to good use.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Before they begin, Riju holds her arms skyward and declares that she will calm Naboris.<ref>{{Cite|My name is Riju, descendant of the royal line and leader of the Gerudo people! With the power of the heirloom passed down in my family, I shall calm the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Naboris}}.|Riju|BotW}}</ref> She then gathers power by asking her ancestors to aid her and specifically asks Lady Urbosa for her protection.<ref>{{Cite|Ancestors of the Gerudo! Answer my call! Aid me in this task! Oh, wow! I can feel their power coursing through me! {{Color|BotW Blue|Lady Urbosa}}... Please grant Link and me your protection...|Riju|BotW}}</ref> Link and Riju then ride Sand Seals into the sandstorm toward Naboris. Link must ride his Sand Seal close to Riju so that Riju's Thunder Helm absorbs the lightning and leaves Link unharmed. With the help of Riju, Link manages to enter the Divine Beast. Later on, Riju tells Link that she heard Urbosa call her name while taking down the Divine Beast.<ref>{{Cite|That strong, warm voice...It must have belonged to Urbosa...|Riju|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter completing the Divine Beast, Link visits Riju again in the palace. As thanks for Link's help, Riju offers Link priceless pieces of equipment that were once worn by Urbosa.<ref>{{Cite|I want to offer you these as thanks for your help. I trust you'll accept them. These pieces of equipment are priceless treasures of the Gerudo people.

When Link interacts with the Thunder Helm, Riju will offer to lend it to Link.<ref>{{Cite|And if you truly desire it, then perhaps I can lend it to you...|Riju|BotW}}</ref> However, she then says that Link must earn it by gaining the trust of her people.<ref>{{Cite|Well then, let's see how serious you are.

Once Link finishes the Side Quest and returns to Riju, she tells Link that she has heard of his actions in delivering happiness to her people.<ref>{{Cite|I have heard of your recent actions.

This is indicated by the stuffed animals in her room and the seal designs on her bed. Her young stature is also made indicated by the booster cushions on her throne, and when she wears the [[Thunder Helm]] it does not fit properly on her head often sliding forward.\n*Riju can be seen doing a hop of excitement and asking her stuffed animals what they should play in her bedroom. When spoken to afterwards, she will try to take attention away from the stuffed animals and state they should be ignored. She will then state it's rude to wander into someone's room at such a late hour of the night.<ref>{{Cite|Wh-What?! The sand-seal stuffed animals? Don't worry about them! Just... Just ignore them, OK?
