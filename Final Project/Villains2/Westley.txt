"{{Infobox character\n|name = Westley\n|image = S1e7_Westley_putting_on_star_hat_3.jpg\n|shows = ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''\n|personality = Villanous (formally) Loyal, devoted, kind, friendly, caring, helpful.\n|alignment = Neutral/Bad, later Good\n|friends = Lord Hater (formerly), [[Wander]], [[Sylvia]]\n|enemies = [[Wander]] and [[Sylvia]] (formerly), [[Lord Hater]]\n|voice = [[Aziz Ansari]]}}\n'''Westley''', formerly known as '''Private Westley''', was a loyal watchdog of [[Lord Hater]]'s army up until the recent events that occurred in the ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'' episode \"[[The Little Guy]]\". In a failed mission to capture [[Wander]] and [[Sylvia]], Westley is left behind. His only way to get rescued is to capture Wander and Sylvia and report to [[Commander Peepers]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nWestley wears the regulated watchdog uniform, black with red gloves and boots and a black cap with a small lightning bolt on top. Like every watchdog, he also has an eyeball for a head with a red iris. Westley is short and overweight with stubby arms and legs. He is the youngest of the watchdog army.\n\nAt the end of \"The Little Guy\", Westley changes his cap from one with a lightning bolt to one with a star on top which was given to him by Wander.\n\n===Personality===\nProbably the most energetic of watchdogs, Westley is both a loyal soldier and strong supporter of Hater's Empire. He is shown to be a bit of a day-dreamer but determined to do his best. His short stature and weight tend to make him lag behind the other watchdogs as he lacks the same physical strength and is often clumsy. Throughout \"The Little Guy\", during his adventures with Wander and Sylvia, Westley constantly accuses them of being the \"real bad guys\" and refuses to trust them (as influenced by Lord Hater). As the episode continues, Westley slowly begins to soften up to the two vagabonds until finally laying down his laser pistol. However, when Lord Hater's ship arrives, and Lord Hater himself alongside Peepers stand outside waiting for the young watchdog. Westley turns against Wander and Sylvia and turns them in. Later, however, Westley plays a trick in helping the vagabonds to escape and appearing to die in a fake attempt to stop them. In other words, he is imperfect.\n\nAt the very end of the episode, Westley is given his new hat, throws away his laser gun and parts as good friends with Wander and Sylvia.\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*Westley, along side [[Commander Peepers]], Moose, Bob, Pete, Teddy, Greg, Barry, and Tim is one of the only named Watchdogs so far.\n\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
