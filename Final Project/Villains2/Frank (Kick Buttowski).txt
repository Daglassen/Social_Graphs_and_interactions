"'''Frank'''\u00a0is an old man who steals\u00a0[[Kick Buttowski (character)|Kick]]'s new suit in \"[[Clothes Call]]\"''.''\u00a0His lines only consist of the words: \"You punk kid!\". His real first name is Frank as it is shown in the ending of \"Clothes Call\" that he is the owner of the umbrella store (\"Frank's Umbrellas\") that is missing a giant U from its sign due to Kick borrowing it for one of his stunts (which he never gets to perform). He is voiced by\u00a0[[Tom Kenny]]. \n[[File:Clothescall grumpyoldman.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]\n\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
