However, Clueless is the most na\u00efve of the group; as suggested by his name, he often seems unaware of the ramifications of his villainous deeds. He is a poor swordsman, striking his own allies and surrendering when the same pirate he hits is defeated. He is later beaten up by the other pirates when he believes they learned a valuable lesson when defeated.\n\nClueless Morgan was also featured in several UK Spots on ''Muppets Tonight'' with his Muppet Treasure Island co-star Polly. In these skits, the pair work as bartenders seen through the eyes of Mr. Callahan and Clueless displays his singing abilities. He has most recently appeared in the ''Muppet Snow White'' comic book as a bouncer at a nightclub alongside his old castmates Polly and Mad Monty.\n\nClueless Morgan appears as a Gulag 38B in [[Muppets Most Wanted]].\n\nAccording to Clueless Morgan's puppeteer [[Bill Barretta]], part of the reason that Clueless has not been used in any productions since Muppets Tonight is that the puppet has gone missing. Barretta added to this comment, \"If anyone out there has seen him, please ask him to call home. His family misses him.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nClueless Morgan in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Clueless Morgan in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nImALittlePirate.jpg|Clueless Morgan and the rest of the pirates perform ''I'm a Little Pirate'' in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nClueless Morgan catches Bad Polly in his lobster trap.jpg|Clueless Morgan catches Bad Polly in his lobster trap\nKermit, Bad Polly, Mad Monty and Clueless Morgan in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Clueless Morgan with Kermit, Polly Lobster and Mad Monty in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nKermit and the crew from Muppet Treasure Island.jpg|Mad Monty, Kermit, Polly Lobster, Clueless Morgan, Big Snort and the rest of the crew from Muppet Treasure Island in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nA still snapshot of Clueless Morgan in a circle of a closing sequence background of Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|A still snapshot of Clueless Morgan in a circle of a orange background for the closing credits of ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nA snapshot of Kermit and the Muppet Treasure Island cast in a circle of a closing sequence background.jpg|A still snapshot of Clueless Morgan, Kermit, Polly Lobster, Mad Monty and the rest of the Muppet Treasure Island crew in a circle of a orange background for the closing credits in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nclueless2.jpg|Clueless Morgan in Muppets Tonight\nBeautifulDreamer.jpg|Polly and Clueless Morgan in Muppets Tonight\nclueless3.jpg|Clueless and pirates sing \"Sailing for Adventure\"\nclueless5.jpg|Clueless Morgan, Polly Lobster, Mad Monty\nclueless4.jpg|Clueless Morgan and Rizzo\nMonty def.jpg|Bad Polly, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan and other pirates defeat\nMuppets Treasure Island 41565 Medium.jpg|Clueless Morgan and other pirates\nSailing For Adventure 1996 .jpg|Bad Polly, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan singing \"Sailing For Adventure\"\nMovie-MTI-Promo04.jpg\nMTI-Promo-Dangling.jpg\nThat's_Amore_MT.jpg|\"When........the.......moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore\"\nMorgandevelopment.jpg|The Clueless puppet in development\n</gallery>\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Muppet Treasure Island characters]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:The Muppets characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
