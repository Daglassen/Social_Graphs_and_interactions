In her youth, Gaddison was part of the Big Bad Bazz Brigade with {{Term|BotW|Bazz|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Rivan|link}}.<ref name=\"Rivan\"/> Before the {{Term|BotW|Great Calamity|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} would play with her and her friends.<ref>{{Cite|We...used to play together all the time. That was 100 years ago. My name is Gaddison.|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link first approaches Gaddison, she reports that the east gate to Zora's Domain is clear.<ref>{{Cite|Yes, sir! East gate is all clear, sir!|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> However, she quickly recognizes Link, calling him a sight for sore eyes.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! Well, if it isn't Master Link! Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> She realizes that Link must be the {{Term|BotW|Hylian|link}} that {{Term|BotW|Sidon|link}} brought to the Domain.<ref>{{Cite|The Hylian that Prince Sidon brought here... Don't tell me that was you, Master Link!|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Gaddison notes that Link hasn't changed at all in 100 years,<ref>{{Cite|And what's more...you don't seem to have changed much in the last 100 years...|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> but she dismisses it as she doesn't have time to chat.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, but I shouldn't be making idle chitchat just now.|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> She's supposed to watching the {{Term|BotW|East Reservoir Lake|link}} as part of her job, but asserts that she can talk to Link later.<ref>{{Cite|I'm supposed to be fulfilling my officially appointed duty by keeping watch at the east gate. I must maintain my surveillance of the {{Color|BotW Blue|East Reservoir Lake}}. We can chat later.|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce Link has calmed {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Ruta|link}}, Gaddison notices the clear sky wonders whether Sidon managed to stop the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Hey! Link! Please take a look. For the first time in what feels like an eternity, the skies have cleared! I wonder if Prince Sidon really managed to stop Ruta's water assault...|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> She is still wary of the water level of the Reservoir, even after Ruta has stopped spouting water.<ref>{{Cite|That's right. I'm supposed to keep an eye on East Reservoir Lake. Ruta was spouting water, and the lake was in danger of flooding... But now, there's been no increase in water level! Still, you'd best not let your guard down. As long as Ruta is in the reservoir...|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> She shares some of the history of Vah Ruta, such as {{Term|BotW|Mipha|link}} piloting it 100 years ago, and wonders if {{Term|BotW|Seggin|link}} managed to fire {{Plural|BotW|Shock Arrow|link}} at it.<ref>{{Cite|Ruta is its nickname. Its full and proper name is the Divine Beast Vah Ruta. If memory serves, 100 years ago Lady Mipha rode inside of it...and used the Divine Beast to fight the Calamnity. I would have thought you'd already know that, Master Link... Hmm, but Ruta's water sprouting seems to have subsided a bit... Did Seggin manage to fire those shock arrows after all?|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref>\n\nGaddison is seen in the crowd of Zora who watch as {{Term|BotW|King Dorephan|link}} praises Link. She is grateful for all that Link has done,<ref>{{Cite|Thank you for appeasing the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Ruta}}!|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> as she can return to her work and the Domain can receive tourists again.<ref>{{Cite|Now I can have some peace of mind and return to my mission!|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It would be best if we started getting more tourists again...|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring the \"{{Term|BotW|From the Ground Up|link}}\" {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}}, Gaddison can be asked to move to {{Term|BotW|Tarrey Town|link}} due to her name ending in \"-son\". However, she will refuse Link's request. After {{Term|BotW|Kapson|link}} has left, Gaddison will inform Link that he was heading to {{Term|BotW|Akkala|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, that reminds me! The Zora whose name ends in \"son,\" just like mine does, has left the domain. His name is Kapson. I believe he said he was heading to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Akkala}} region.|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> She offers Link a shortcut to Akkala by climbing the waterfalls of {{Term|BotW|Mikau Lake|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Lulu Lake|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Just climb the waterfalls at {{Color|BotW Blue|Mikau Lake}} or {{Color|BotW Blue|Lulu Lake}}. That will offer you a pretty decent shortcut to {{Color|BotW Blue|Akkala}}.|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref> However, she's concerned for Kapson to be crossing the mountains at his age.<ref>{{Cite|Hmm, but for him to be crossing the mountains at his age... Good gracious! I'm glad he's in good health, at least.|Gaddison|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Zora|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Zora's Domain|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hyruleans, Zora\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
