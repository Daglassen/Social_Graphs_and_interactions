Trivia Despite having betrayed Colonel Brydon and his daughter when Wilkins stutters while explaining his reason for betrayal and shows slight discomfort when seeing the Colonel beaten Buldeo possible conclude that Wilkins may still have had small spark respect for the Colonel had nothing against him his daughter and that the only reason why betrayed them was just because his hatred Mowgli and his
