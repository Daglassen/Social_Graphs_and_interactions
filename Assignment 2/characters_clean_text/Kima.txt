Kima is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Kima is a man who is found at the Southern Mine in Eldin. He wears a Flamebreaker Helm over his head to protect himself from the Region's intensely hot climate. When spoken to, Kima admits that he had just returned from Goron City, but forgot to bring any souvenirs for the trip. He decided to try catch catching Fireproof Lizards, but is having difficulty because of how fast they are. Kima then asks Link if he could catch him 10 Fireproof Lizards, telling him that he will give him some heat-resistant armor in return. This initiates the "Fireproof Lizard Roundup" Side Quest. After bringing him the requested Lizards, Kima gives Link his Flamebreaker Armor. He refuses to part with his Flamebreaker Helm however, and tells Link that he can buy his own at Goron City.
Afterwards, Kima stays at the Southern Mine searching for extra Fireproof Lizards. He will offer to pay Link 20 Rupees for every three Fireproof Lizards he brings him.  He also gives Link advice that he can make Fireproof Elixirs by Cooking Fireproof Lizards with Monster Parts.
