He was portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the Storm\u00a0that occurred during\u00a0The New King, Part 1: Destiny's Child, Tito was there when Boz mistook the plug of the island for a shelter and unplugged it, sending Mindu into the sea. He appeared\u00a0on Kinko\u00a0threatening Boz\u00a0that he would\u00a0tell all the people on the island what he did. Boz was forced to do anything Tito said.\n\nTito made Boz tell\u00a0Boomer to shut down Boomerama so\u00a0he could\u00a0take over. Boz then revealed he was the one who sank Mindu and after Boomer's speech about how Boz's action got both islands together. Tito was taken\u00a0to the dungeon. (\"I Know What You Did Last Sunday\")\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is said that Tito is like the Mindu version of [[Lanny Parker]].\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Pair of Kings characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
