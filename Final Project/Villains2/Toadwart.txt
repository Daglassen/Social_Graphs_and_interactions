Though the smallest of the Ogres, he is slightly more intelligent than the others, capable of reading and writing. Being the most intelligent Ogre at [[Drekmore Castle]], he serves as Igthorn's second-in-command.\n\n==Role in the series==\nToadwart is usually seen in the employ of Duke Igthorn, helping Igthorn carry out his evil plans to conquer [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]]. He is often bullied and mistreated by Igthorn, but continues to attempt to please Igthorn.\n\nToadwart features heavily in a few episodes. In \"[[Toadie's Wild Ride]]\", Toadwart makes his way into [[Gummi Glen]] by accident and begins snooping around. Later on, in \"[[Do Unto Ogres]]\", Toadwart is cast out by Igthorn, but later returns.\n\nIn \"[[Just a Tad Smarter]]\", Toadwart's cousin [[Tadpole]] arrives. Tadpole is shown to be smarter and bossier than Toadwart, and is able to rally the Ogres in a revolution, ousting Duke Igthorn as ruler of Drekmore. Tadpole soon proves to mistreat and suppress the Ogres even more so than Igthorn did, and has Toadwart thrown in the dungeon for a minor reason. Tadpole also attempts to use vengeance against the Gummi Bears, by ruining their Gummiberry crops.\n\nThe episode \"[[Toadie the Conqueror]]\" also prominently features Toadwart, who happens to be the only being that can fit into a magical suit of armor that grants its wearer invincibility. When Toadwart realizes the power of the armor, he tries to take Duke Igthorn's place as conqueror of Dunwyn.\n\n==Relationships==\nToadwart is extremely loyal to Igthorn, and appears to genuinely like him, despite Igthorn's constant mistreatment and physical abuse. In addition, in Toadwart's eyes, his abuse at the hands of Igthorn as his assistant still means he has a semblance of authority over the Ogres, who abuse him for their own amusement.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n==Trivia==\n*Toadwart is one of the few Disney characters to refer {{WikipediaLink|Illeism|to himself in the third person}}, the others being [[Gurgi]] from ''[[The Black Cauldron]]'', [[George of the Jungle (character)|the titular character]] from the ''[[George of the Jungle]]'' [[George of the Jungle 2|films]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], and sometimes [[Stitch]] from the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]], and [[Babi]] from ''[[Treasure Buddies]]''.\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toadwart}}\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]"
