=== Breath of the Wild ===

Cursed Lizalfos appear in Breath of the Wild, being spawned from Malice and attack Link on sight. They are the skulls of Lizalfos that have been revived by Malice. It's noted that they retain their slyness after death and will attack any creature on sight. They, like the Cursed Bokoblins and Cursed Moblins only appear in the 4 Divine Beasts and Hyrule Castle. Cursed Lizalfos will continuously spawn until the eye of the Malice is destroyed.
