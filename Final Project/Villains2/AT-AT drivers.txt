Because of the reinforced armor of the AT-AT, many of the Rebels' defensive turrets are unable to pierce it, and Rogue Squadron leader [[Luke Skywalker]] is forced to have his snowspeeders attempt to trip the walkers up using their tow cables. Veers and his two AT-AT drivers are unfazed as they continue to advance on the Rebel defensive lines, blasting any anti-infantry or anti-armor turrets they see to pieces before targeting their primary objective: the shield generator. As Rebel ground troops begin to withdraw and retreat from their destroyed positions upon orders from Princess [[Leia Organa]] to have all remaining Rebel personnel evacuate, Veers and his two drivers shoot down one of the remaining snowspeeders before targeting the shield generator and destroying it with ''Blizzard 1'' having its weapons set at maximum firepower.\n\n===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===\nThe AT-AT drivers appear in several episodes when their walkers are used against the Lothal Rebels on various occasions. In one encounter with several former members of the Clone Army, including former 501st Legion Captain Rex, under the command of Agent Kallus, the AT-AT walkers attempted to do battle with their predecessor, the AT-TE walker that the clones were using as a makeshift home. Kallus has Rex and the other clones at his mercy before [[Kanan Jarrus]], [[Ezra Bridger]], and [[Garazeb Orrelios]] are able to commandeer the second AT-AT, with Zeb knocking out the two drivers before they know what hit them, and turning the walker on the one carrying Kallus. When Rex uses the main cannon of the AT-TE to deliver a mortal blow to the neck of Kallus' AT-AT, Kallus and his two drivers are able to evacuate the walker and escape, but while one driver flees riding on Kallus' speeder bike, the other is forced to run after them on foot.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nRelics of the Old Republic Concept Art 01.jpeg\nThe-Lost-Commanders-1.png\nAtatpilot2015.png|[[LEGO]] minifigure\nAT-AT_Driver_Sideshow.png\nAt-AT Driver Funko Pop.jpg\n</gallery>{{Star Wars}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n\n\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
