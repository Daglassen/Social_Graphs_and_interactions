When Scolex orders his henchman, [[Sykes (Inspector Gadget)|Sykes]], to drive the remote-controlled van, Mad Cat mews and walks up to the front and starts pawing at the remote, much to Sykes' frustration. This causes their van to crash. However, Scolex's robots roll into the lab and steal the Bradfords' equipment.\n\nWhen they escape, Scolex has his hand crushed by a bowling ball owned by security guard John Brown. MAD Cat is presumably taken back to Scolex's building, the Scolex Industries headquarters. He is later seen in Scolex's (now Claw's) large office, where his net worth rises after he sells the machinery he stole from Bradford Labs. He steals Sykes' cruller, where he chases him.\n\nMAD Cat is not seen until near the end of the film, where Claw holds him while escaping to his helicopter with [[Brenda Bradford]], the daughter of Artemus Bradford, the owner of Bradford Labs (whom Claw had murdered). MAD Cat gets startled when [[Penny (Inspector Gadget)|Penny]]'s dog, [[Brain (dog)|Brain]] starts tearing up Claw's pants. Eventually, he is placed in SI's helicopter while Claw tries to escape. However, the helicopter is destroyed by John Brown (now known as [[Inspector Gadget (character)|Inspector Gadget]]). Claw and MAD Cat jump out with parachutes. They land in the [[Gadgetmobile]], which cages them in. MAD Cat is later seen being held by Claw as he is arrested, and swears vengeance against Gadget.\n\n===''Inspector Gadget 2''===\nAt least a year after Gadget arrested Claw, MAD Cat appears as a longhaired cat with some black streaks. He is first seen in Claw's new lair in his lap. It is unknown where Claw got him; either this is a different cat or Claw retrieved Sniffy from his pound/shelter. \n\nMAD Cat is seen with Claw throughout various scenes of the film, such as sitting with him in his new limo and laying around in his lair. He is also featured in a drawing of Hatch done by his minions. \n\nLater, MAD Cat is seen sleeping on some gold bars in the Riverton Gold Reserve while Claw's henchmen load some of the other bricks into his truck. However, he is grabbed by Claw when Inspector Gadget arrives. \n\nMAD Cat is last seen with Claw in his rocket. He mews one final time, as Claw shouts his famous quote as the rocket takes off. It is unknown where they are now.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the original 1980s cartoon, MAD Cat's fur was array of grey, black and white with stripes in contrast to the films. \n{{Inspector Gadget}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Inspector Gadget characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
