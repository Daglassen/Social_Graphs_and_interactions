At some point in time, he lost his left-hand and replaced it with a golden hook. He participated in the ransacking of the Spanish town of Puerto Dorado on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Isla Tesoro]].\n\nWith the crew searching for the island's legendary treasure, the keeper was given the job of interrogating the town's magistrate [[Carlos (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Carlos]]; namely on the location of the town's treasure and the Wench's rival, Captain [[Jack Sparrow]]. The pirate went about this with water-torture, having his men dunk the magistrate in a well and attempt to shoot his wife.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===\nThe Hook Hand Pirate appears in the well scene, where he leads a small gang of pirates, who have kidnapped the town officials and are torturing them in the well by lining them up to dunk in the well.\n\nGuests witness Hook Hand interrogating the town's magistrate Carlos while questioning him about the whereabouts of the town's treasure along with the location of Jack Sparrow. In the original incarnation of the ride, he interrogated Carlos only on the location of the trasure.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although this character is called \"Hook Hand Pirate\" according to the Pirates of the Caribbean action figures released in 2006, he is not related to the ''Peter Pan'' character [[Captain Hook]] despite his name.\n**A pirate dressed similarly to [[Mr. Smee]] does stand nearby the hook-hand pirate.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nfaa350828795e0a2d54eddc3e37457dc.jpg\n81cHOSaDANL.
