Ganon soon found out and sent his men after Impa. Though she managed to stay out of their reach for a long time, she was eventually captured. However, she was saved by a strange boy who managed to chase away Ganon's henchmen.

In the room behind the door lay a [[Sleeping Zelda|princess of Hyrule]] from ancient times and before Link could ask any questions, Impa told the princess' story.<ref>[http://gallery.zeldalegends.net/displayimage.php?pid=430&fullsize=1 {{TAoL|-}} Manual; Page 5-6]</ref> When she was done telling, she picked up six [[Crystal]]s and a scroll lying on a stand next to the altar and gave them to Link.

The short-lived reunion is interrupted by an aggravated Ghirahim, who kidnaps the newly awakened Zelda and proceeds through the second Gate of Time that is located in the center of the temple, traveling to the temple's distant past.

Since you have lost your memory, I will recount for you all that has happened... The history of the royal family of Hyrule is also the history of Calamity Ganon, a primal evil that has endured over the ages. This evil has been turned back time and time again by a warrior wielding the soul of a hero, and a princess who carries the blood of the Goddess. With the passage of time, each conflict with Ganon faded into legend. So listen closely as I tell you of this \"legend\" that occurred 10,000 years ago.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> She proceeds to retell the tale of 10,000 years ago to make up for the gap in Link's recollections.<ref>{{Cite|Hyrule was then blossoming as a highly advanced civilization. Even the most powerful monsters posed little threat to the denizens of the realm. The people thought it wise to utilize their technological prowess to ensure the safety of the land, should Calamity Ganon ever return. They constructed four mechanical wonders that came to be known as the Divine Beasts. They also built a legion of autonomous weapons called Guardians. The Divine Beasts were piloted by four individuals of exceptional skill from across the land. And thus, the plan to neutralize Ganon was forged. Upon Ganon's inevitable return to Hyrule, the princess and the hero fought alongside these four Champions against this ancient evil. The Guardians were tasked with protecting the hero as the Divine Beasts unleashed a furious attack upon their terrible foe. And when the hero wielding the sword that seals the darkness delivered his final blow... The princess used her sacred power to seal away Calamity Ganon.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Impa explains that they had attempted to follow the steps that had been taken before,<ref>{{Cite|A hundred years ago... in preparation for the foretold revival of Ganon, we strove to follow the lead of our ancestors of 10,000 years prior.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> but they had failed.<ref>{{Cite|But...in the end...

She is Princess Zelda's nursemaid<ref>{{Cite Book|quote=Zelda sent her loyal nursemaid Impa to find this hero...|book=The Legend of Zelda|publisher=Valiant Comics|page=Prologue [Issue 1]}}</ref> and is wise in all things concerning the land of [[Hyrule]] and the [[Triforce]]. Because of this, her advice to Link and Zelda is crucial in their quest to protect the kingdom from Ganon. In ''[[He Also Serves]]'',  Impa is the one that warns Link, through the prophetic words of the Triforce of Wisdom, that Hyrule could fall at the hands of Ganon if the young hero leaves the [[North Palace]] to accompany the princess to another town in the kingdom.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote=Hyrule's  North Palace destroyed.

She plays a major role in the book since it is through her wise words that Link is able to discover [[Charles of Moria|Charles]]'s [[Ganon|true identity]]. She is first introduced in the book when Link and Charles are having the archery match. Just as Link is choosing the [[Arrow]] that he will use for the match, Impa walks towards him and tells him to use the [[Green Arrow]] that she puts in his hand, saying it is enchanted with magic.<ref name=arrow>{{Cite Book|quote='Link,' she says. 'Use this.' She shoves a green arrow into his hand. 'Why?' Link asks. Impa pinches Link's cheek.

'The more I see of Sir Charles, the more I wonder what he's really up to.'|book= The Shadow Prince|publisher=Mammoth|page=75}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the book, Link often goes to Impa for advice to consult about his next step. At one point, Impa suggests to him that he should have patience and not defy Charles before he learns of his true identity. She then sends him off to the [[Water Town of Saria]] to retrieve the [[Mirror of Truth]] and gives the young hero the [[Golden Whistle]] in case he may need it, the former being the item that will ultimately help lead to Charles's defeat.<ref name=mirror>{{Cite Book|quote='There's only one thing to do.

In the game's introduction, she uses the [[Triforce of Wisdom]] to foresee the future and assures Zelda that the King will safely return, although this proves to be false as months pass with no word. The two decide to go to Gamelon to find them both, and Impa brings the Triforce of Wisdom as they sail to the island.\n\nImpa fulfills a similar role to [[Gwonam]] from {{TFoE}}, by using the Triforce of Wisdom to look into the events of Gamelon and by introducing certain bosses. She learns through the Triforce of Wisdom that the King had been captured, and Link involved in a terrible fight. The Triforce of Wisdom later reveals that the King had been captured by Ganon. Impa also informs Zelda that the residents of [[Sakado]] were taken to [[Tykogi Tower]], and that [[Wizzrobe#The Wand of Gamelon|Wizzrobe]] had captured [[Lady Alma]]. Finally, she also informs Zelda that the Triforce of Wisdom states she can only defeat Ganon and win by \"falling\", although Impa does not understand what this means.\n\n==={{OoA|-}} (Himekawa)===\nIn the {{OoA|Himekawa}}, Impa appears and follows a similar story as shown in the original {{OoA|-}} game.

She teams up with Sheik in  the Age of the Hero Of Time on Death Mountain, accusing them of being a spy.\nSheik uses the Mirror Of Truth at Lake Hylia, revealing that they were Zelda all along. The Princess reassures Impa that she did not fail, and they join forces to save Princess Ruto.\n\nShe uses a [[Giant Blade|curved great sword]] as her weapon. She also appears to have some magical ability, manipulating water to take the shape of throwing knives and even copies of her sword. Enemies struck by these attacks have their heads surrounded by suffocating bubbles. Her second style is a [[Naginata]] (Japanese pole weapon; similar to a glaive) which allows her to manipulate fire.\n\nHer design is based on her {{SS}} incarnation, though some elements are also taken from {{OoT|-}}.
