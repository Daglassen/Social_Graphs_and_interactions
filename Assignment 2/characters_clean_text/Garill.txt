Garill is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Garill can be found living underneath a tree at Fort Hateno in East Necluda. Each day, he goes to observe the ruins of Fort Hateno. When Link first encounters him, he mentions paying respects to the soldiers who lost their lives defending the Fort in the Great Calamity.
When prompted, Garill teaches Link about a Hylian Champion. He explains that 100 years ago, there were a group of warriors known as the Champions, and while one fought at the Fort, the others perished in battle. With the other soldiers, he managed to hold back the onslaught of Guardians. He also shares a rumor that the Champion was mortally wounded and taken to be revitalized to fight again after a long slumber and wonders if he'll be around for the day he wakes up.
Garill is struck by the tragedy at Fort Hateno when he sees the ruins and is boggled by how many Guardians there are. He reasons that the Champion must have been a great threat to the forces of darkness. He attributes the existence of Hateno Village, and by extension his own life, to the sacrifices made at Fort Hateno and vows to pass this knowledge on.
Garill fancies the idea that he would have fought alongside the Hylian Champion if he were present during the Great Calamity, and expresses wonder at the Champion's skill to have been capable of felling the Guardian Stalkers. attacking the Fort.
If Link wakes Garill up at night, he says that while he'd love to keep talking with him, he's observing a moment of silence for everyone who fought against the Guardians. He tells Link that they can continue speaking in the morning.
