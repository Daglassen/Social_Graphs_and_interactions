She is a mouse living somewhere in [[Hawaii]]. She bears a strong physical resemblance to [[Gadget Hackwrench]], though differing in fashion style.\n\nShe appeared in the episode \"[[Gadget Goes Hawaiian]]\".\n\n==Personality==\nShe has been chosen to become the queen of the mouse tribes she lives with because she is adored by them, due to her ability to cease the imminent eruption of a nearby man-made model volcano.

After she met Gadget, she swapped roles with her and let Gadget undergo the series of tests.
