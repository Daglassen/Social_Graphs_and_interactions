They appear in the cartoon as recurring antagonists, constantly picking on Ned and pulling pranks in his nightmares.\n\nIn the adventure game, they appear only as background characters. They appear in one of the cutscenes in the school nightmare, stomping Ned down as they shove by. A short time later, it's revealed that Conrad and Vernon had clogged the toilets in the bathroom with paper towels, which Ned got in trouble for, as the bullies had just fled the scene and Ned was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nConrad and Vernon are named after [[Conrad Vernon]], who is known for his work in many DreamWorks films and also served as one of the show's storyboard artists.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nConrad Nightmare Ned.png|Conrad\nVernon Nightmare Ned.png|Vernon\nConrad and Vernon 02.png|conrad and vernon in ned's life as a dog\nAlicorn Conrad & Vernon.png|conrad and vernon as alicorns in one of neds nightmares\nConrad and Vernon 03.png|conrad and vernon in girl trouble\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Nightmare Ned}}\n{{DTVA shows}}\n[[Category:Nightmare Ned characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
