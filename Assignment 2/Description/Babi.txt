More likely, once we finish repairing our spears, we'll have to get started on more special training. {{Small|*sigh* Babi's always got more special training...}}|Marta|BotW}}</ref> She also claims that Babi is working too hard, even though the heirloom has been returned, hopinh to never be as intense as she is.<ref>{{Cite|Babi is working way too hard, even though the chief's heirloom is back! I hope I never become as intense as her...|Marta|BotW}}</ref> [[Smaude]] also comments, wondering if Babi thinks training without rest proves her discipline and wishing Babi could feel how tired she is.<ref>{{Cite|That Babi... \"Training without rest is the pinnacle of discipline!\" I wonder if that's what she's thinking... I just can't keep up with her, though. I wish she could feel how tired I am...|Smaude|BotW}}</ref> She also thinks Babi would train for days on end if no one stopped her.<ref>{{Cite|Babi...
