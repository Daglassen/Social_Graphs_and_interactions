Contrary to what Romeo actually wanted, it began to try to take over the world herself in \"Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage\". This was due to a loose screw and was later resolved. During the episode, Romeo's original\u00a0robot\u00a0became jealous of Robette, which resulted in it running away. This was also later resolved and Romeo became friends with Robot again. Robette returned in the\u00a0Season 2\u00a0episode \"[[PJ Robot (episode)|PJ Robot]]\".\n\n== Abilities ==\nRobette's abilities mainly consists of laser-related attacks, and varies with different effects to the target:\n*Her beams can allow her to control other machines and devices such as Robot (as emphasized in \"Armadylan and Robette Rule\").\n*Her beams can vary from being heat type to physic type (as emphasized in both \"Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage\" and \"Armadylan and Robette Rule\").\n\n== Personality ==\nRobette was generally nice and helpful but turned evil as previously mentioned.
