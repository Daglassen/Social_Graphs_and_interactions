"[[File:Formless.png|thumb|250px]] \n'''The Formless '''are the army of the [[The Skeleton King]] and are the primary antagonists during the first season of the [[Jetix]] show, ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]''.\n\nThey do not speak or have any expressions, they're basically zombies made out of ooze that the Skeleton King commands at his will on his ship, the [[Citadel of Bone]]. On the ship, he keeps a tank of ooze that makes his army to which to send to [[Shuggazoom]] to attack it. The Formless are very stupid and not very powerful, but when a large group of them come together, they can make a giant formless monster to attack the city. When a formless is defeated, it will melt back into ooze. The formless are\u00a0usually seen riding on motorcycles into the city.\n{{Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!}}\n[[Category:Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Article stubs]]"
