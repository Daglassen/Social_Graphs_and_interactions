If [[Link]] approaches the nearby [[Ancient Orb]], Shabonne scolds him and exclaims that only those who have proven themselves may touch it.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Hey, hey, hey!!}} Only someone who has proven themselves may touch that ancient item!|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Don't for a moment think you can just walk up and touch it anytime you like! It's not for you!|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> If Link talks to Shabonne, she apologizes to him because Tali is not in the mood for autographs.<ref>{{Cite|Sorry, kid. The great Tali isn't in the mood to give autographs right now. Could you come back later?|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks what happened, Shabonne explains that the Sand-Seal Race course is unusable with the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Naboris|link}} stomping around.<ref>{{Cite|Use your eyes! The {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} is stomping around, so obviously we can't use the {{Color|BotW Blue|sand-seal race course}}.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> She then rudely tells him that he can stand around, but that she would prefer he did it elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite|I suppose you can stand around here if you want, but I'd prefer you did it elsewhere.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about Sand-Seal Racing, Shabonne is surprised that Link has not heard of it and explains that it is a sport where people guide {{Plural|BotW|Sand Seal|link}} through arches on a race course.<ref>{{Cite|So everyone in the world has heard of {{Color|BotW Blue|sand-seal racing}} except you... Have you been sleeping under a rock?|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Blue|Sand-seal racing}} is a sport where people guide {{Color|BotW Blue|sand seals}} through arches as they race toward the finish line.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> Shabonne says that the racer with the fastest time wins, but they cannot run any races with the [[Divine Beast]] around.<ref>{{Cite|The racer with the fastest time wins. It's a true Gerudo tradition!|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|But because of this blasted {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}}, we can't run a single race right now.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks who Tali is, Shabonne is in disbelief that he does not know the Sand-Seal Racing champion and says that Tali could demonstrate her skills if it were not for the Divine Beast.<ref>{{Cite|\"Who's Tali\"? Are you serious right now?|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You aren't seriously saying you don't recognize Tali, the {{Color|BotW Blue|sand-seal racing champion}}, are you?|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|That stupid {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} is the only thing stopping us from showing you Tali's sand-seal skills firsthand!|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks Shabonne who she is, she explains that she is the one who raised Tali into a racing champion.<ref name= \"Toot\"/> She goes on to say that it was not easy and that her relationship with Tali is great despite Tali's shyness.<ref>{{Cite|It wasn't easy, let me tell you. She's always been a bit shy, but her and I have a great relationship now.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> Shabonne asks Tali if that is right, and Tali responds with silence as usual.<ref>{{Cite|Isn't that right, Tali?|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|...|Tali|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Yes, yes, right. Understood, Tali.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> Shabonne is angry that the Divine Beast has upset Tali.<ref>{{Cite|Who in the blazing sands does this Divine Beast think it is?! No one upsets the great Tali and gets away with it!|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> She also comments that the cold Desert nights must be rough on [[Hylian]]s and that the Gerudo are used to it.<ref>{{Cite|The frigid temperatures of the desert at night are pretty rough on you Hylians, aren't they?|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I guess we're all used to it...|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link returns to the Sand-Seal Rally after calming Naboris, the Sand-Seal Race will be open again.<ref>{{Cite|You see, now that the {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} is gone, we can finally use the race course.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> Link can speak to Shabonne or Tali to begin the [[Shrine Quest]], \"[[The Undefeated Champ]]\". Shabonne tells Link that if he can beat Tali's record of 1:30, he can have a trophy.<ref>{{Cite|Tali's record is {{Color|BotW Red|1}}:{{Color|BotW Red|30}}! If you can beat that record, that {{Color|BotW Blue|trophy}} is yours.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> The trophy that Shabonne refers to is the nearby Ancient Orb needed to reveal the [[Ancient Shrine]], which has been passed down by ten thousand years of Sand-Seal Racing champions.<ref>{{Cite|This is the {{Color|BotW Blue|grand trophy}} that's been passed down by ten thousand years of sand-seal-racing champions.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> Shabonne charges Link 50 [[Rupee]]s to race against Tali's record.<ref>{{Cite|I forgot to mention...Since you're racing against the champ's record, it'll be {{Color|BotW Red|50 rupees}} per race.|Shabonne|BotW}}</ref> When Link beats Tali's record and places the Ancient Orb into its pedestal, the [[Raqa Zunzo Shrine]] rises from the ground and the Shrine Quest is completed.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
