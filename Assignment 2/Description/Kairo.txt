He used to work at the [[Goron Hot Springs]], but grew bored there and decided to travel the world as a merchant.<ref>{{Cite|I got plain sick and tired of working the Goron Hot Springs in {{Color|BotW Blue|Goron City}}, so I decided to just up and leave. I'm going to see the world! I want to see somewhere cold, I want to see green trees and hills!|Kairo|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I am more suited to the life of a traveling merchant for sure.

How about a {{Color|BotW Red|diamond}}? You interested in rare items?|Kairo|BotW}}</ref> As with all other merchants, he will buy items from Link as well.\n\nKairo mentions that he and [[Yunobo]] are friends, and wonders how he is doing while he is away.<ref>{{Cite|I wonder how my old buddy {{Color|BotW Red|Yunobo}} back in {{Color|BotW Blue|Goron City}} is doing.
