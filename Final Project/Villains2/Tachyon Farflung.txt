Tachyon is shown as a notorious intergalactic thief who hid himself on the planet Melbar, described as crime capital of the universe. He discovers Scrooge's fortune by using an interstellar spyscope. Then Tachyon comes to Earth on his spaceship determined to steal Scrooge's Money Bin. Like Princess Oona, Tachyon Farflung is a comic character developed through a partnership between the Swedish couple Stefan and Unn Printz-P\u00e5hlson and the Chilean cartoonist Vicar. Tachyon's original skin color is green, but some countries showed him with light creamy skin. This character appeared in more than five comic stories.\n[[Category:Apes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"
