"[[File:Vince_Artwork_HQ.jpg|thumb]]\nVince is a rather arrogant and confident race car from Queens, New York, that first appears in Cars: The Video Game. Vince is the leader of a gang of Queens race cars, consisting of himself, Sonny, Lenny and Barry, and first arrived in Radiator Springs to challenge Lightning McQueen under secret partnership with Chick Hicks, though later stayed in the town to compete in more races.\nVince appears to be a 1971 Pontiac Firebird that is painted red, with white lines up his hood and roof, along with the number \"9\" painted on his doors. He has chrome rims, and while he does not possess a rear license plate in most versions of the games, he has one in the Wii version of Cars: The Video Game and the Wii and PS3 versions of Cars: Mater-National Championship, simply reading \"VINCE\".\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
