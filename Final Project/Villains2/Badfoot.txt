Badfoot is supported by his horn section, he dresses like James Brown, and he used to carry with him a power item called the Lick-n-Stick. On a yearly basis, he would come into the city to drain Woo Foo energy out of Master Yo. When Yin and Yang \"fought the funk\" (even though they had to use it their way), they managed to aid Master Yo in defeating Badfoot at last, claiming the Lick-n-Stick in the process.\n\nBadfoot later returned in the episode \"[[Old Softie]]\", wanting to get the Lick-n-Stick back. He dressed up as Salty McSalterstein, the soft pretzel factory owner, setting up traps while his horn section tried to get the Lick-n-Stick (which they both failed in doing). After all of his other traps failed, he decided to bake the Woo Foo Warriors into a giant pretzel; but Master Yo used Sakwa Foo to break Yin, Yang, and himself out. Badfoot, knowing he was defeated, ran off.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
