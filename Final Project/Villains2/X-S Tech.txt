Clench's philosophy on his company's management}}\n\n'''X-S Tech''' is a fictional alien corporation from the defunct [[Magic Kingdom]] attraction [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter|The ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]].\n\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nX-S Tech is an interstellar corporate-conglomerate which develops a vast amount of advanced technology.  It hails from a yet-unnamed alien planet (of which most its higher ranking members seem to be the dominant species of) and is noted for its shady, often amoral business dealings.\n\nAccording to X-S Tech spokespeople, X-S tech is the universe's number one in terms of: Electro Robotics, Cryo Cybernetics, Techno Surveillance, Planetary Restructuring, Genetic Engineering, and Hyperspatial Transport.  In addition to this they sponsored the Pan-Galactic News Network and had a subsidiary in the form of RoboMart.\n\n==== Products ====\n* '''X-S Series 5000 Rescue Unit''':\n* '''Cryo-Cybernetics''':\n* '''Genetic Engineering''':\n* '''Planetary Restructuring''':\n* '''Electro-Robotics''':\n** '''The''' '''[[S.I.R.|Simulated Intelligence Robotics Series]]:'''\n** '''Technobotic Oratorical Mechanism Series 2000:'''\n* '''Hyper-Spatial Transports''':\n** '''X-S Series 1000\u00a0Teleportation Tube''':\n\n==== Subsidiaries ====\n\n* '''Pan-Galactic News Network''':  The Pan-Galactic News Network was an interstellar televised news service which X-S Tech owned.\n* '''RoboMart''':  RoboMart was a business which obtained a variety of robots through unknown means and sold them.\n\n=== Development ===\nEvil interstellar corporations were conceived for the ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter attraction since it was first conceived as ''Nostromo''.  Originally having been planned to be based on Ridley Scott's [[1979]] film ''Alien'', the X-S Tech's origins are found in the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.\n\nIn the film, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation is a large conglomerate corporation which attempted to get its hands on the deadly alien Xenomorph.  It did this by manipulating a crew of uninformed and unsuspecting freighters working for them to pick up one of the alien's eggs, resulting in a massacre on the ship.\n\nWhen Alien Encounter became its own I.P., the X-S Tech corporation was originally conceived as being much more similar to the role of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation in the film.  In original drafts, their demonstration of teleportation technology would have been a front to release the alien on [[Tomorrowland (Magic Kingdom)|Tomorrowland]] intentionally to study its potential use as a living-weapon.\n\nSince the attractions removal, XS-Tech has been referenced in other attractions\n\n==Appearances==\n\n=== ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter ===\nThe Hostess in the introductory video states the company grew from a small manufacturing plant on an alien world into the number one provider of various technologies including teleportation. The company has been criticized for investing interest in Earth solely for profit and for putting \"sales before science\", but [[L.C. Clench|chairman Clench]] assures it's the company's \"responsibility\" to help less advanced cultures improve their technology and that \"profit is merely a byproduct\". The company is heavily implied to be corrupt, as evidenced by the aforementioned accusations against them and also the indifferent and even sadistic nature of [[S.I.R.]]'s treatment of [[Skippy (alien)|Skippy]].\n\nIn the attraction, which takes place at the fictional ''Tomorrowland Interplanetary Convention Center'', X-S is demonstrating its latest endeavor in teleportation technology. Unfortunately, when the company's chairman, L.C. Clench, decides to have himself teleported into the test chamber, the teleportation signal is disrupted, and a malevolent [[The Alien|alien creature]] is teleported into the chamber instead. This shows that the company can be reckless at times, despite their intentions.\n\nThe alien then escapes into the audience, wreaking havoc. Afterward, the technicians operating the demonstration manage to get the creature in the tube and teleport it back to where it came from.\n\n===[[Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!|Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Breakout]]===\nAn X-S tech invoice signed by Chairman Clench addressed to the ''Tivan Collection'' can be seen in the office of [[Taneleer Tivan|''The Collector'']] in ''Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Breakout''.\n=== Invasion! An ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter ([[DisneyQuest]]) ===\nIn Invasion! An Alien Encounter at DisneyQuest, XS-Tech provides assistance to the colonist rescue mission by offering their X-S 5000 Rescue Unit to the cause, which Clench sees as good PR for the company and a way of promoting the new machine.\n\n=== [[Space Mountain (Magic Kingdom)|Space Mountain]] ===\nA removed element of the Magic Kingdom's Space Mountain's queue was a series of television screens playing messages from the ''Pan-Galactic News Network''.  Before commercial-break, the newscasters identified the news network as being sponsored by X-S Tech.\n\n=== [[Stitch's Great Escape!]] ===\nStitch's Great Escape is the (now-defunct) attraction which succeeded Alien Encounter following the attraction's closure.  Likely as a remnant rather than easter-egg, XS-Tech brand teleportation tubes are still featured in the pre-show being used by [[Sergeant C4703BK2704-90210]].  Similarly, the 'broken seat cover' in the theatre area has the X-S logo under the words (in AE font) and the words, \"Temporarily Seized\".\n\nThis went to show that the United Galactic Federation purchased at-least some of its technology from the shady X-S Corporation.\n\n=== Rockettower Plaza ===\nA robot called, \"Robo-Newz\" used to appear at the base of the plaza, selling newspapers with a front-page article detailing the events of ExtraTERRORestrial.  XS-Tech advertisements played on the screen of the Tomorrowland Stage introduced for ''Stitch's Supersonic Celebration''.  Namely their subsidiary, \"RoboMart\" was shown selling robots such as [[Tom Morrow 2.0]], the [[Timekeeper]] and [[9-Eye]].\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{Space Mountain}}{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Fictional companies]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]\n[[Category:Tomorrowland]]\n[[Category:ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Campus characters]]\n[[Category:Space Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
