He is also the main character in ''Where's My Water? ''in ''[[Where's My Water?|Cranky's Story]]''.\n\n== Appearance ==\nCranky takes on the appearance of a anthropomorphic obese light green alligator (not as light compared to Allie) and he is the largest alligator in the sewer, towering over [[Swampy]] or [[Allie]]. He has purple irises on his eyes, 12 teeth sticking out (6 on each side) of his mouth and a blue scar on his belly. Cranky's claws, toes and scales are blue and his skin has dark patches of mud. His tail is look's a lot like Allie, except it's longer, thicker and pointer; but unlike Allie, the tail faces inward. \n\nIn the second game, Cranky is very similar in looks to his original counterpart, the only difference is that he is slightly darker and has a shadow like line that runs from his chest to the base of his tail.  \n\n== Personality\u00a0==\nCranky is the largest alligator in the sewer. He is always hungry, eats anything and has an issue with\u00a0algae. As his name suggest, he is very cranky and always shown with an angry face.\n\nHe was formerly in a relationship with\u00a0Allie in the first game, until she abandoned him when Swampy gave her a purple bow. He sabotages Swampy's shower and bullies him whenever he gets the chance and he doesn't show aggression towards Allie.\n\nIn the second game, he and Swampy\u00a0aren't enemies anymore but he stills has many of his original traits though, such as being lazy, bossy and disrespectful. But he tends to be funny towards the player like eating all the food in the Bayou cutscene or doing a final dance pose in the main menu. Cranky also has a pet crab, only appearing in the main menu or at the beach.\n\nIn Where's My Water?: Swampy's Underground Adventures, Cranky often uses\u00a0the other alligators\u00a0as his minions to perform \"dirty work\".\n\n==Role in ''[[Where's My Water?]]''==\nCranky causes trouble for [[Swampy]] in every chapter in any way he can. Cranky hates to eat vegetables and will eat anything he finds in the sewer. He lives even deeper then Swampy does and holds the title of leader of the alligators. Cranky and his gang spend most of their days tormenting Swampy. The reason for such behavior is caused by Cranky's hatred of humans. Since both Swampy and the humans bath, Cranky feels that Swampy has no role in their society. He originally had a relationship with the sewer's female resident [[Allie]] but she left Cranky for Swampy, causing even more tension between the two gators.\n\n===''[[Where's My Water?#Cranky.27s Story|Cranky's Story]]''===\nCranky appears as the main character of the spin-off which is an in-app purchase in the first game. Here, players must assist Cranky in retrieving his \"junk food\", much like how they gave Swampy his bath water in the original game, but using purple poison water to remove the algae from his food. If the player uses regular water or runs out of poison water, he or she will fail and the level must be restarted. The story has 4 chapters and a potential 5th on the artist's site.\n\n* \"Cranky's First Course\": Cranky runs out of poison water and his food remains covered in algae in his lair.\n* \"Hunger Pains\": Swampy and Allie celebrate Cranky's Birthday, but Cranky is still hungry.\n* \"Bulking Up\": Swampy decides to help Cranky get some exercise to get him back in shape in the city's subway yard, but all Cranky wants to do is eat.\n* \"Overstuffed\": Swampy and Allie are on a dock using bait at the end of their fishing rods to feed Cranky. But as Cranky keeps swimming, he misses the bait and pulls on the rods, even Allie's rod come loose from her grip. The dock starts to collapse while Swampy and Allie watch helplessly. The ending shows Cranky with a full stomach sleeping.\n\n== Eating Habits in WMW & WMW2 ==\nIn the first game, Cranky eats his food in nearly the same way every time. He rocks back and then forth while lifting one leg at the same time. He either chomps his food in 2 different ways or swallow it whole. After he swallows, Cranky puts his hands on his belly.\n\nIn the second game, Cranky stretches his body and bends down rather then rocking back and then forth while lifting one leg at the same time, then he chomps 12 times and then swallows it. After he swallows, Cranky does not put his hands on his belly just like in the classic game.\n\n== Trivia\u00a0==\n* Like\u00a0[[Swampy]], Cranky is also voiced by Justin T. Bowler\n* Cranky is well known for his cackling like laugh\n* Just like all the Alligators in the sewer, Cranky has four fingers and two toes. But real gators have''' '''5 toes on the front legs while the back legs have only 4 toes.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Where's My Water? characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Swampy's Underground Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]"
