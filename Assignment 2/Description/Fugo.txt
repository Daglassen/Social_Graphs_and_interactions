He can be found outside of the blacksmith {{Term|BotW|Rohan|link|display=Rohan's}} house. Fugo is training under Rohan as his apprentice so that he may one day be his successor.<ref name=\"Rohan\"/>\n\nEven when he's tired, Fugo will answer any questions.<ref>{{Cite|It's time I got some sleep...but if ya really need somethin', I don't mind.|Fugo|BotW}}</ref> According to Fugo, Rohan is a blacksmith who keeps the ancient arts alive.<ref>{{Cite|Master Rohan is a godly blacksmith.

If you wanna talk to him, be sure to approach him carefully.|Fugo|BotW}}</ref> When Rohan is sleeping, Fugo suggests that Link come back the next day to speak to him.<ref>{{Cite|Well, {{Color|BotW Blue|Master}} Rohan is resting now... You should get some sleep at the {{Color|BotW Blue|inn}} or kill some time and come back tomorrow.|Fugo|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAs part of his training, Fugo was assigned by Rohan to defeat every {{Term|BotW|Igneo Talus|link}} around Goron City.<ref>{{Cite|Master Rohan is a godly blacksmith. He's responsible for keepin' the ancient arts alive! He's really strict with everyone\u2014me included. In my case, he told me to beat every {{Color|BotW Blue|Igneo Talus}} around Goron City as part of my training.|Fugo|BotW}}</ref> He later explains that Rohan fought every Igneo Talus to grow stronger when he was young, and hopes to also reach that same goal.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Blue|Master}} fought the Igneo Talus when he was young, and he got stronger that way. Some say he fought every {{Color|BotW Blue|Igneo Talus}} that exists in the world and beat 'em all! Hrm...

Fugo then decides to offer Link 100 {{Plural|BotW|Rupee|link}} in exchange for the achievement, and gives him a {{Term|BotW|Silver Rupee|link}}. in return.<ref>{{Cite|Whaaaa\u2014?!
