When they investigated, Dr. Piltdown and his team saw what they believed to be a dinosaur egg in perfect condition and shipped it off to the museum. Unbeknownst to them, however, the \"dinosaur egg\" was really a spacecraft piloted by [[Steggy]], an alien Stegosaur from a world beyond.\n\nDr. Piltdown isn't seen again until the episode's climax. When he and the researchers happened upon Steggy, they set out to make him part of the research project.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nB 25-BoneWire1 many.jpg\nB 25-BoneWire3 3.jpg\npildaun.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-08-05-19h51m40s983.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-05-20h11m30s829.png|Piltdown showing Steggy's Spacecraft.\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-09h56m39s952.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-05-19h52m04s217.png|Piltdown's defeat.\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Piltdown}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
