They are an ancient race of beings renowned for their many legends and adventures as gods on Earth. They are ruled by [[Odin]] and seek to keep the peace between the \"nine realms\" of the Asgardian cosmos.\n\nThough these godlike beings are peaceful, they are a brave and powerful warrior race whose passion for adventure is their religion. Like the Vikings of Earth, they believe that the only way to gain access into Valhalla (heaven) is to die in glorious battle. Their civilization was built up by, and essentially depends on, magic and sorcery.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Thor ''===\nIn 965 A.D., a group of Frost Giants invaded the city of Tonsberg because they had lost their supremacy in the Nine Realms. Due to this, the Asgardians led by Odin went to Migdar to stop them. After a long battle, the Asgardians managed to drive them away, and already in Jotunheim Odin defeated Laufey and so ended the war between the two races. Thousands of years after the war between Asgard and Jotunheim, the Jotuns unsuccessfully tried to retrieve the Casket of Ancient Winters. A furious Thor decided to go to Jotunheim with his friends to defeat the Jotuns, once and for all.\n\nJotuns led by Laufey quickly overpowered Thor and his friends and they were saved only because Odin intervened. As punishment, Odin decided to banish Thor for his crimes committed. On Earth, Thor learned the sacrifice to fight for others which earned him to regain his powers. Thor returned to Asgard to face his brother Loki who had planned all this to keep the throne. As a result of the battle, the Bifrost bridge was destroyed and Loki fell to Yggdrasil. Finally, Odin and Thor then reconciled after their discussion caused by Loki.\n\n===''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]''===\n[[Frigga]], Queen of Asgard and the adoptive mother of [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] saw him negotiating with [[Thanos]] and [[The Other]] the future of Earth. [[Odin Borson|Odin]] then using black magic sent [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] to Earth to bring Loki and retrieve the [[Tesseract]]. Thor arrived late as Loki had already stolen the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and had also killed eighty people. Thor eventually allies with the other heroes after briefly fought against [[Iron Man]] and [[Captain America]].\n\nHe informed the others that Loki has an army called the [[Chitauri]] and in exchange of Earth he would give them the Tesseract. Thor later faces Loki again, who had murdered the friend of Thor Agent [[Phil Coulson]]. After a fierce battle, Loki was defeated by Hulk, who thanks to his incredible strength managed to defeat him. Thor then took Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard in order that both no cause more trouble on Earth. The Councilman Gideon Malick reproaches this to [[Nick Fury]], who replied that he would not oppose Odin nor Thor.\n\n===''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''===\nIn 2986 BC, [[Malekith]], the leader of the dark elves wanted the universe was plunged back into eternal night by using the [[Aether]]. However, the noble Asgardian troops led by King [[Bor]] traveled to [[Svartalfheim]] to stop them. Both sides took heavy casualties but the Asgardians were able to snatch the Aether before Malekith used it. In a desperate attempt, Malekith ordered his soldiers to crash their ships against Asgardians, while he and the other soldiers escaped to plan his revenge. Finished the battle, Bor ordered his men to hide the ancient weapon since that they could not destroy due to its immense power.\n\nThousands of years later, Thor and his father Odin discovered that Aether still existed and also the dark elves were not extinct. As Aether was in [[Asgard]], Malekith and his troops were there to retrieve their weapon. During the attack there were many Asgardian casualties, including Queen [[Frigga]]. To prevent another attack, Thor and Loki took Jane Foster and traveled to Svartalfheim, where they will allow Malekith take the Aether and so destroy it forever. However, their plan does not go as they expected because the Aether could not be destroyed. On Earth, Thor managed to defeat Malekith after a fierce battle.\n\nAfter the battle, [[Sif]] and [[Volstagg]] traveled to [[Knowhere]] to meet Taneleer Tivan, better known as the Collector. On Tivan's museum, the two of them asked Tivan to protect the Aether at all coasts. Volstagg told Tivan that it was not wise to have two [[Infinity Stones]] in one place after this one and asked them why they had not stored it in their own vault. Sif and Volstagg left the room, where the Collector revealed to his assistant, Carina his desire to get the six [[Infinity Stones]].\n\n===''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''===\nIn 2015, Thor and his teammates were informed about the location of Loki's scepter, which was lost during S.H.I.E.L.D.'s collapse. The God of Thunder using his incredible strength easily defeated the HYDRA soldiers;he during the fight asked Stark and Rogers to found the scepter at all costs. After the battle against HYDRA, Thor was happy to find the scepter.\nDays later, Thor learned that Stark used the scepter to create an AI which eventually decided to face his creator because he believed the Avengers were all killers. During one of the fights against Ultron, Thor was affected by Scarlet Witch's powers. He had a vision in which [[Heimdall]] blamed him of the imminent destruction of [[Asgard]]. After this vision, Thor contacted his friend [[Erik Selvig]] to find the Water of Sights. Thor could finally see his complete vision and realized that Stark was right.\n\nThor went to the [[Avengers Tower]], where he using his Mjolnir gave birth to synthetic android that Ultron and Helen Cho had designed. He explained that the gem that android had in his forehead was the most powerful gem in the universe and that the only way they could defeat Ultron. He and Stark eventually had reason as Vision was able to defeat Ultron. After Ultron's defeat, Thor returned to Asgard to discover who was in the search of the six [[Infinity Stones]].\n\n===''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''===\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n===''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''===\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n===''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''===\nIn 2023, five years after Thanos's victory and the destruction of their people, the Asgardians ended up reestablishing civilization in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway on Earth, naming the town New Asgard. Deprived of their wealth, the Asgardians lived a simple, rural life where many became fishermen. Thor was still their king, but due to his hermetic lifestyle of drinking and playing video games, his people did not see him unless he would require more alcohol. [[Hulk]] and [[Rocket Raccoon]] came to New Asgard to convince Thor in joining them on a mission to retrieve the Infinity Stones after [[Scott Lang]] discovered time travel during his imprisonment in the [[Quantum Realm]].\n\nAfter the Avengers successfully retrieved the Infinity Stones and undid Thanos's snap, the Asgardian population was restored. Shortly after, the Masters of the Mystic Arts sent Valkyrie, the Einherjar, Korg, and Miek through a portal to fight in the battle at the destroyed New Avengers Facility against alternate Thanos and his army. In the aftermath of Thanos's defeat, the Asgardians were now led by a new king, Valkyrie, after Thor decided to give up his crown and start over with his life.\n\n===''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]''===\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the Asgardian language is spoken for the first time in the [[Lamentis|third episode]] of the ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' series, when [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]]  becomes drunk and starts to sing \"[[Jeg Saler Min Ganger]]\". The language used to create this song and the Asgardian language is Norwegian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/loki-song-language-foreign-translate-meaning/ |title=What Language Loki Sings In (And What His Song Means) |website=ScreenRant|date=[[June 24]], [[2021]].}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAsgardians.jpg\nHogunFandralVolstagg-Thor.jpg\nAsg- Thor.jpg\nLoki-Thor-Movie-Wallpaper-5-1-.jpg\nSif2-Thor.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{MarvelMoviesWiki}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Asgardians]]\n[[Category:Thor characters]]\n[[Category:Norse Mythology]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Guardians of the Galaxy characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Doctor Strange characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:What If...? characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Loki characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]"
