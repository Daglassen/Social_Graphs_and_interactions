When she reaches Kakariko Village, Brokka will rest at the {{Term|BotW|Shuteye Inn|link}} before continuing her journey. At Dueling Peaks Stable, she sits at the table inside before heading out.\n\nBrokka is very passionate about {{Term|BotW|Gem|link|display=Gemstones}},<ref>{{Cite|I can't think about anything else... It's just ore and gems and making money all the time.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> often singing {{Term|BotW|Gem}}-themed lyrics while walking.<ref>{{Cite|\u266aMorn'n diamonds.\u266a|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|\u266aStars are sapphires.\u266a|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|\u266aSun rays of topaz.\u266a|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|\u266aRupees over rubies.\u266a|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|\u266aIt's raining opals.\u266a|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> She wonders if she should think about things that can help others, informing {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} that placing a {{Term|BotW|Bird Egg|link}} in a {{Term|BotW|Hot Spring|link}} will make a {{Term|BotW|Hard-Boiled Egg|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Maybe I should try thinking about things that can help others and not just my wallet... For example... Did you know you can put a {{Color|BotW Blue|bird egg}} into a hot spring and you'll make a hard-boiled egg? That's helpful!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|My stomach is rumbling... Maybe I'll put a {{Color|BotW Blue|bird egg}} into a hot spring to make a hard-boiled egg.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> During her travels, Brokka also has a tendency to zone out.<ref>{{Cite|... Oh, yikes! I'm sorry! I was having such a beautiful daydream, I was completely zoned out...|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> Though she considers owning something as beautiful as a Gem important, she also highly values money.<ref>{{Cite|Physically owning something as beautiful as a gem is important, but... money is nice, too.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> In general, she enjoys things that sparkle, but she loves Gems and money in particular.<ref>{{Cite|I love the way a gem sparkles in the right light, but the profits selling a gem can bring also sparkle something wonderful. I guess I just really love things that sparkle.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I love pretty much everything that sparkles... Stars in the night sky... The shimmer off a lake... Gems... Oh, gems, I'd pick you over everything else! ...Because I can sell you at a high price and be rolling in money! *sigh* I love things that sparkle so much.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen it's raining, Brokka may not feel like talking.<ref>{{Cite|... Honetly, I don't feel much like talking when it's all rainy out.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> She may also inform {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} that {{Plural|BotW|Bomb Arrow|link}} won't ignite in such weather.<ref>{{Cite|When it's pouring rain, the fuses on bomb arrows will go out, so they won't explode.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> However, Brokka then asks about the look on Link's face, stating she's allowed to talk about things aside from Ore.<ref>{{Cite|What's with that look? Am I not allowed to talk about something besides ore?|Brokka|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf spoken to, Brokka will give {{Term|BotW|Link}} advice on collecting {{Plural|BotW|Gem}} from the {{Plural|BotW|Ore Deposit|link}} near {{Term|BotW|Dueling Peaks|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|There's a lot of high-quality ore around here... How about using a bomb to make an exciting {{Color|BotW Red|explosion}}?|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You can dig up a bunch of ore on Dueling Peaks! Now that I think about it, I should use a hammer to mine that ore!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> According to her, the mountains are rich in Ore, and she dreams about selling the Gems she mines from there.<ref>{{Cite|...Have you ever been to the Dueling Peaks? Those mountains are really rich in ore! I want to get out there with a trust hammer and really mine up a fortune! I can see it now... Big piles of gems stacked neatly as far as the eye can see.

Like...bombs? There's a ton of high-quality ore around here, and bombs can be used to mine it quickly. Plus, there'll be a cool explosion!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> but asks that {{Term|BotW|Link}} not set any off near her.<ref>{{Cite|Just... Don't set the bombs off near me, OK?|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> Despite this, Brokka prefers using {{Plural|BotW|Hammer|link}} for mining over Bombs.<ref>{{Cite|Some people use bombs... But hammers are the best for mining.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref>\n\nBrokka may also notice his pouch, reminding him to sell any Ore he has since it's worth a lot.<ref>{{Cite|You've got a nice pouch for carrying things, but are you carrying a lot of ore? If you're just carrying it around, you're missing out on a chance to make a killing! Ore is valuable!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> In particular, she suggests selling {{Plural|BotW|Ruby|link}} and {{Plural|BotW|Sapphire|link}}, due to their high value.<ref>{{Cite|The best way to realize a gem's true value is by selling it! {{Color|BotW Blue|Rubies}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|sapphires}} sell for a high price! Better to sell than to hold on to them until you're old and gray.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Thinking about {{Color|BotW Blue|rubies}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|sapphires}}... Those two gems can be sold at really high prices! They're some of the best gems to sell for serious money!!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> She believes that the amount of {{Plural|BotW|Rupee|link}} that Gems sell for is a great motivator.<ref>{{Cite|Even if the sight of gems doesn't spur you to action, I'm sure the sight of what they sell for will!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> According to Brokka, the value of a Gem comes from its beauty,<ref>{{Cite|A gem's value lies in its beauty... I was just thinking about all the wonderful gems I've seen!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> and she herself has sold some beautiful Gems.<ref>{{Cite|And I was thinking about the glee I've felt when I consider all the money one can sell a beautiful gem for! Not to brag, but I just made a few sales and am feeling full of glee at the moment...|Brokka|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Brokka will give Link directions if she thinks he looks lost, and suggests using his {{Term|BotW|Map|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Blue|Dueling Peaks Stable}} is to the south, and {{Color|BotW Blue|Hateno Village}} is to the east. Make use of your map while you're traveling.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You're lost, aren't you? Oh, no, it's OK! Everyone gets lost from time to time.

If you have a map, look at it as you travel.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|To get to {{Color|BotW Blue|Kakariko Village}}, follow the roads north.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> She laments the fact that there isn't a Map for life.<ref>{{Cite|It's too bad there isn't a map to life, you know?|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> She'll also direct him to Kakariko Village, saying that since she sells Ore there, she knows it well.<ref>{{Cite|You wouldn't happen to be heading to {{Color|BotW Blue|Kakariko Village}}, would you? If you are, just follow the roads north. That village is one of the places I sell ore at, so I know the way really well!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|To get to {{Color|BotW Blue|Kakariko Blue}}, follow the roads north.|Brokka|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link saves Brokka from [[Enemies in Breath of the Wild|monsters]], she will be grateful for his help. She may comment on his strength, swearing to never forget that he saved her.<ref>{{Cite|Wow, you're really powerful! I'll never forget that I owe you my life!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref> She'll give him Rupees, meals, or {{Plural|BotW|Elixir|link}} as a reward.<ref>{{Cite|This is to show my thanks!|Brokka|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Term|BotW|Brokka}} is named after {{Wp|Broccoli}}.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Hylian|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Dueling Peaks Stable|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Kakariko Village|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Bugut|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
