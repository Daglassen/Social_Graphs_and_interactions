They are then caught off guard by a sudden arrival of [[stormtroopers]] from the remnant of [[Moff Gideon]]. \n\nAmbushing from the heights, Fennec brought down several stormtroopers and destroyed a heavy blaster by rolling a boulder over it. As the skirmish heats up, she finds herself surrounded with Mando by enemy soldiers, but Boba's sudden arrival in his Mandalorian armor turns the tide. Although they are held firm, Mando's ship is destroyed and Grogu is captured by the Dark Troopers. Boba chases them but gives up when he discovers the cruiser and therefore the return of the empire, to Fennec's disbelief because the New Republic is supposed to be under surveillance in this sector.

Unfortunately, the Dark Troopers storm the checkpoint, the group being separated from the droids only by the armored doors giving way. Suddenly an X-wings enters the cruiser and the pilot destroys several Dark Troopers all by himself with a lightsaber and the Force. In a final attempt, Gideon shoots Bo-Katan and Mando while wanting to shoot down Grogu before being held in play by Fennec, Koska and Cara and then being knocked out by the ex trooper while attempting to kill himself. The mysterious individual then joins the group, revealing himself to be [[Luke Skywalker]], having been contacted by Grogu on Tython. Fennec subsequently witnesses the farewell between Mando and Grogu when the Mandalorian lets the child follow Luke and [[R2-D2]].\n\nFennec later storms [[Jabba the Hutt|Jabba]]'s palace, slaughtering Bib Fortuna's men and freeing a slave once in the process. Boba joins Fennec and kills himself the late Jabba's former valet before sitting on his throne with Fennec sitting next to him drinking Spotchka.\n\n===''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch]]''===\nMore than two decades earlier, Fennec was contacted by Raspar Six who informed him of the presence of a young girl named [[Omega]] on Pantora that Fennec had been tracking for some time. Fennec meets Omega as she accidentally split with her friends, skillfully gaining her confidence until Hunter intervenes, allowing Omega to escape while the bounty hunter and ex-sergeant trooper briefly engage in unarmed combat. Fennec continues to stalk Omega in town, catching up with her at a communications tower and attempting to flee by vehicle until Hunter retrieves the girl. Once her target out of Pantora, Fennec paid Six to inform her if the Bad Batch ever came back here before informing her employer that she will going to continue pursuing Omega.\n\nAlerted by Kaminoan Nala Se who is also her secret employer, that Omega has been captured by [[Cad Bane]], Fennec intercepts the veteran bounty hunter on Bora Vio. She immediately assassinates Taun We who came to hand over the bounty for the capture of Omega and then confronts Bane personally before arriving the site where Taun We was murdered. With Bane knocked out by an explosion, Fennec again encounters Omega in the disaffected cloning facility on the planet where she tries to claim Omega by explaining she's trying to help her. However, the girl remains suspicious of Fennec and refuses to trust her since the incident on Pantora before she escapes her after a failed attack from Bane's droid, Todo 360. Bane returns to attack Fennec, turning out to be more of a match against her. Clone Force 99 manages to rescue Omega during the clash, so Fennec escapes from Bora Vio after sabotaging Bane's ship so he cannot pursue her or the clones. She then contacts Nala Se to ask for her payment for having been able to prevent Omega from being brought back to Kamino as had been agreed from the beginning while offering her services in the future if Nala Se needs her again.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Fennec Shand is both voiced and portrayed by [[Ming-Na Wen]] the whole time.\n*She is based mostly on the fennec fox, an animal well known for its cunning and ability to survive. Ironically, this canine lives in desert environments and Fennec's first appearance was on the desert planet Tatooine.\n*She appears to have left her helmet on Tython after using it as a projectile against the Stormtroopers. However, in the trailer for ''[[Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett]]'', Fennec is seen wearing her helmet, meaning she was able to return to Tython and reclaim her helmet.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFennec Shoot.jpg\nFennec Incouscious.jpg|Fennec about of being saved from death.\nMandalorian2x06 0768.jpg|Fennec with [[Boba Fett]].\nFennec Boba Mando.jpg\nBoba Alliance.jpg|Fennec and Boba join forces with Mando.\nSlave One Team.jpg\nThe Mandalorian - 2x07 - Chapter 15 The Believer - Fennec Shand and Cara Dune.jpg|Fennec with [[Cara Dune]].\nFennec Sniper.jpg\nFennec Koska Gideon.jpg|Fennec and Koska threats Moff Gideon with their blasters.\nBoba Throne.jpg|Fennec alongside Boba Fett after their takeover of Jabba's Palace.\nFennec Omega.jpg\nFennec Fruits.jpg\nFennec Fight Hunter.jpg\nFennec Save Omega.jpg\nFennec Gun.jpg\nFennec Angry Stare.jpg\nFennec Contact.jpg\nEmojiBlitzFennecShand.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Fennec Shand}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[pt-br:Fennec Shand]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Mandalorian characters]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
