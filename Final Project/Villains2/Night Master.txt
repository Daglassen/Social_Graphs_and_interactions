The Night Master appears to be a demonic sorcerer bat of some description and has a liking for gothically ostentatious outfits. He frequently communicates with his lackeys by using a hologram. He was banished to a dark realm by [[Coop]] in the season one finale, but it is said a new Night Master will soon rise to take his place. Night Master's appearance is obviously similar to Aku of ''Samurai Jack'' fame. He is considered to be the actual main villain throughout the series, even though [[Carl the Evil Cockroach Wizard|Carl]] appeared in most of the episodes, while many think that Carl was the main villain since the first season. In \"[[Pros and Cons]]\", he has an ego. As revealed in \"[[The Pecking Order]]\", he is one of an eternal line of Night Masters alongside [[Eradicus]] and an unnamed cobra-like woman.\n\nHis real name (since \"Night Master\" is a title) has not yet been revealed. Ever since his defeat, the other villains have been developing their evil in an attempt to become the new Night Master. [[Ultimoose]] temporarily succeeded in doing so after he found the [[Amnesulet]], but was defeated by Yang and stripped of the title. As is revealed in \"[[Shadowcluck]]\", he survived the final battle against Yin, Yang, Yo and Coop (\"[[Night Fall]]\"). He sold his army to Eradicus for 13.50 Karchings. At the end of \"Shadowcluck\", it was also revealed that he was still evil. It's unknown how he escaped the dark dimension he was banished to.\n\n==Powers & Abilities==\nThe Night Master proved a formidable opponent to the Woo Foo Knights in training, a master of dark magic he could conjure spells and energy attacks at will. Able to match master Yo (though unable to actually beat him) when the panda was in his prime. He has also displayed considerable intellect and manipulation skills.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nNight Master Shadow.png\nwubble night master 02.jpg\nWubble Night Master.png\nHey That's Evil!!.png\nNightMaster Geosynchrometer.jpg\nNight Master Amnesulet.jpg|Using the Amnesulet\n</gallery>\n\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bats]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers]]"
