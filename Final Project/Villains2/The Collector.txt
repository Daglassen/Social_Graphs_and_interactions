I'm a Toon!\"}}\n'''The Collector''' is a sinister being from the show ''[[Bonkers]]'', and the main antagonist of the\u00a0two-episode pilot \"[[Going Bonkers]]\". As the first villain\u00a0whom [[Bonkers D. Bobcat]] encounters, he is somewhat like [[Judge Doom]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. Obscured in shadows to start, he is later revealed to be an amalgamation of cartoon creatures. He wears gloves with pencils on the right, and sharpeners on the left, somewhat similar to Freddy Krueger's razor glove from ''Nightmare on Elm Street''. His main hobby is having [[Toons]] kidnapped and captured in suspended animation.\n\nAt the end of the two-part episode, his right glove comes off when he wriggles out of a pair of handcuffs, revealing a five-fingered human hand underneath. He also can resist walking on a banana peel, when other supposedly cartoons can't. It turns out he is really a deranged human nerd in disguise who has an obsession with cartoons. He is last seen backing away from his reflection in a mirror, apparently actually believing he is a Toon and having forsaken reality, and falling into a Toon world contained inside a steel box.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nGoing Bonkers - The Collector's eye.png|Collector's eye\n502795-vlcsnap 00261 super.jpg\nChar 36798.jpg\n502844-vlcsnap 00475 super.jpg\nGoing Bonkers - Will happen....png\nTheCollector.png\n503329-vlcsnap 00284 super.jpg|The Collector meets Bonkers\nenhanced-4839-1408342086-9.png\n503358-vlcsnap_00392_super.jpg|Piquel arrests the Collector\nThe Collector with Piquel.jpg|Piquel and Collector\n503363-vlcsnap_00414_middle.jpg|The Collector as a nerd human\nThe Collector's Defeat.jpg|The Collector's defeat\nBonkers (SNES) - The Collector.png|The Collector as he appears in the ''Bonkers'' video game for Super Nintendo\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Collector is pretty much the opposite of [[Judge Doom]] in terms of its true identity. While Doom was a Toon disguised as a human, the Collector was a human disguised as a Toon.\n*He is right handed as he is seen with the pencils on his right hand.\n{{Bonkers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Collector, The}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
