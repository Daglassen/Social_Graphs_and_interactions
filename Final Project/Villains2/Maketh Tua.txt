She is a native of the Outer-Rim planet of [[Lothal]], trained and educated off-world. After completing her studies, she pursued a career in public service, eventually returning to Lothal to take up a post as an official of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Tua's early experiences molded her into an ardent, idealistic young Imperial patriot. She sincerely believed that the Empire offered the best future for herself and her world, and worked diligently to increase Lothal's productivity.\n\nDespite her education and training, Tua is largely oblivious to the Empire's darker and more brutal aspects and was unprepared when an open rebellion broke out on Lothal. Tua finds herself at a loss in devising effective means to combat the insurgents and grows increasingly disillusioned and horrified by the utterly ruthless methods employed by men such as [[Darth Vader]], [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], and the [[The Grand Inquisitor|Inquisitor]]. Ultimately, Tua's inability to deal with the rebels on Lothal results in fateful consequences.\n\n==Role in the Series==\n===Season One===\nIn the episode \"[[Droids in Distress]]\", Maketh was on her way to Garel accompanied by Amda Wabo and the two droids [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] to pick up some shipment. It is revealed here she can not understand Aqualish language and when C-3PO and R2-D2 were sent to the back along with [[C1-10P|Chopper]], [[Sabine Wren]] pretended to help her translate what Amda Wabo is saying, claiming she is a Level Five Imperial Academy student.\n\nSabine gave her false information on where Mr. Wabo was keeping the shipment that the Rebels were going after. When she realized she was tricked, she ordered her accompanied [[Stormtroopers]] to Bay Seven where they caught the Rebels stealing their shipment of illegal T-7 Ion Disruptors in order to make some money out of them.\u00a0When the Rebels escaped with the disruptors, Maketh reported the incident to [[Agent Kallus]], who would later lead an assault on the Rebels.\n\nIn \"[[Empire Day]]\", Minister Tua hosted the Empire's fifteenth-anniversary celebration on [[Lothal]] with [[Cumberlayne Aresko|Commandant Aresko]] and [[Valen Rudor|Baron Rudor]]. She presented the Empire's new [[TIE Advanced v1]] starfighter to the citizens and have Rudor the honor of taking it on its maiden voyage. However, the celebrations were ruined by the Rebels when they blew up the new fighter. Minister Tua was furious and ordered Stormtroopers to find the ones responsible. Despite insisting on having the Rebels found and punished for ruining the celebrations, [[Agent Kallus]] and [[The Grand Inquisitor]] told her their priority was still to find the Rodian known as [[Tseebo]] who accidentally downloaded half of the Empire's secrets into his cybernetic implants.\n\nFollowing the ongoing failed attempts to stop the Rebels, [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Grand Moff Tarkin]] arrived on Lothal in \"[[Call to Action]]\" to take charge. Tua personally greeted the governor, nervously expressing her pleasure and surprise to have him on Lothal. Tarkin quickly admonished her for failing in her task to protect the Empire's industrial interest she was charged with during the absence of [[Arihnda Pryce]], which were vital for the Empire's expansion throughout the Outer Rim, by allowing the Rebels to flourish under her nose. Tua could not manage a retort and merely choked out an awkward cough of agreement. She was not alone in this humiliation as Tarkin proceeded to mock Kallus and the Grand Inquisitor as well.\n\nSometime later she, Kallus, and the Inquisitor were summoned to Tarkin's office and stood at attention behind him as [[Cumberlayne Aresko|Commandant Aresko]] and [[Myles Grint|Taskmaster Grint]] arrived. Tarkin questioned the two on their ineffective methods and consistent lack of results, going so far as to suggest their failures could undermine the security of the entire Empire. Tua looked on in horror and disgust as Tarkin had Grint and Aresko executed to serve as a grim warning to her and the others that failure would have merciless consequences from now on.\n\n===Season Two===\nFollowing the incident on [[Mustafar]], Minister Tua began to see the brutality of the Empire and was told by [[Darth Vader]] that she would be \"visiting\" [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Grand Moff Tarkin]] off-planet. Knowing what she may expect from when she meets Tarkin, she requested the Rebel's aid in return for some great secrets for why the Empire was on Lothal. She secretly had the rebels infiltrate the Imperial command center in Capital City while being escorted to her Shuttle. [[Kanan Jarrus]] disguised himself as a Stormtrooper Commander to get past security but was caught by Agent Kallus. Their cover blown, Tua fled to the shuttle, which had been rigged by Vader to explode. Tua was killed in the blast, and the Empire blamed the Rebels for her death.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nWhere is that translator.jpg|\"Ugh, where is that [[C-3PO|translator]]?\"\nDroids in Distress.png\nMaketh-with-R2-D2-and-C-3PO.png\nWabo talking to Tua.jpg\nMaketh 2.png\nMaketh 1.png\nMaketh Tua 1.png\nTo-bay-seven-double-time.png|\"To bay seven, double time!\"\nWill you please top talking.png|\"Will you please stop talking!\"\nMinister Tua reporting to Kallus.png\nMaketh Tua in Breaking Ranks.png\nMinister Tua hosting Empire Day.png\nMinister Tua 1.png\nMinister Tua 2.png\nMinister Tua 3.png\nVision of hope 13.jpg\nInquisitor-Tua-and-Kallus-1.png|Awaiting Governor Tarkin's arrival\nInquisitor-Tua-and-Kallus-2.png\nMinister Tua 4.png\nInquisitor-Tua-and-Kallus-6.png|Horrified by Aresko and Grint's execution\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"medium\">\nStar Wars Rebels Concept 4.jpg|Maketh Tua's concept\nMaketh tua.png|Holonet News Image\nMaketh.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Maketh Tua}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
