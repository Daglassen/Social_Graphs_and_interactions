Slergo is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Slergo is a Goron child who lives at Rohan's smithy. During the day, Slergo walks to the bridges crossing the lava pool in the center of Goron City, where he loiters for the rest of the day. Slergo is initially not very talkative to Link when first spoken to. However, when bidden good-bye as soon as he is greeted, Slergo becomes offended but then interested in Link's style. He decides then to appoint Link as his own student and is willing to answer him questions about the City. However, many of his answers are short and lacking. If Link asks all three questions to Slergo, he becomes excited to have such a curious student, and tells Link to ask him anything he wants, whenever he wants.
