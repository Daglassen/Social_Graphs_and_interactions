According to [[Francis \"Major\" Monogram|Major Monogram]], he is a mercenary for hire and master of disguise, proven by several images of Dennis that are sinister, followed by his harmless \"mindless animal\" look.\n\n==History==\nIn order to gain access to the Flynn-Fletcher household and, by extension, Perry's Lair and the O.W.C.A. mainframe, he lets Candace see him. She immediately attempted to adopt him. Candace used him as a living doll for dress-up and taught him a couple of tricks, inadvertently showing his obsession with carrots. [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda]] spots [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]] and Dennis fighting, but on her double-take, sees both posing as mindless animals. She seems unconcerned that Candace has adopted a pet without her consent. He ultimately reveals his true nature as a feral and clever rabbit  during his battle with Perry. He was defeated by Agent P, whose lair he had infiltrated to hack into the organization, and taken into captivity by the O.W.C.A. (\"[[No More Bunny Business]]\").\n\n==Background Information==\n*Like many rabbits, Dennis has a strong fondness for carrots and has even interrupted his mission in order to eat carrots, which eventually leads to his capture. He eats so many carrots that he cannot fight back when Agent P handcuffs him.\n*Dennis growls as his only vocalization, reminiscent of Agent P's own chatter foreshadowing his true nature.\n*Carl dresses up as him while he tries on disguises (\"[[Undercover Carl]]\") but there is a color error because he is mistakenly pink.\n*It could be that he is an allusion to [[w:c:jamesbond:Alec Trevelyan|Alec Trevelyan]] from the James Bond movie ''GoldenEye''.\n*He also has a \"mindless-pet mode\" like Perry and [[Pinky]].\n*He was mentioned by Candace in the game based on [[Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension (video game)|''Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the Second Dimension'']].\n*He is one of the only known agents to have a name that is not an alliteration, such as Perry the Platypus, or Peter the Panda. Pinky the Chihuahua is not alliterative either.\n*He can dance very well, being able to do \"the Worm\" and \"the Robot\" (\"[[No More Bunny Business]]\").\n*He returns for a second time in the series (\"[[The Return of the Rogue Rabbit]]\").\n*Like Perry and Pinky, Dennis doesn't \"talk.\"\n[[File:O.W.C.A. agents injured by Dennis.png|thumb|right|Two O.W.C.A. agents injured after fighting Dennis]]\n*Dennis is skilled in fighting to the point that he injured current O.W.C.A agents D and O, leaving them with a arm sling and a leg cast respectively.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDennis in disguise.png\nNinja Dennis.jpg|Dennis as a Ninja\nDennis as a biker.jpg|Dennis as a Biker\n640px-Dennis as a pirate.jpg|Dennis as a Pirate\nDennis does the robot.jpg|Dennis in a dress\nDennis ready to fight Perry.png|Dennis is ready to fight Perry\nDennis vs Perry.jpg|Dennis battling Perry moments after revealing his true nature\nPerry disarms Dennis.png|Dennis is disarmed by Perry...\nDennis sees the X-ray glasses.png|...But he sees Phineas and Ferb's X-ray glasses\nDennis about to use X-ray glasses.png|Dennis about to use the X-ray glasses to find an entrance to Perry's lair\nDennis takes Perry's hat.jpg|Dennis swiping Perry's hat\nDennis-the-Bunny.jpg|Dennis at Perry's computer smelling carrots\nDennis arrested.jpg|Dennis, fat, defeated and arrested by Perry\nDennis in prison.png|Dennis imprisoned before his escape\nDennis escapes from prison.png|Dennis escaping from prison with Doofenshmirtz's aid\nDennis wants revenge on Perry.png|Dennis wants revenge on Perry\nRabbit Rogue Mech.jpg\nDennis trapped and about to drown.png|Dennis trapped and about to drown\nDennis is rescued by Perry.png|But he's rescued by Perry\n640px-You Naughty Bunny.jpg|Dennis' 2nd defeat and possible start of redemption\nDennis_tries_to_manipulate_doofenshmirtz.png|Dennis tries to manipulate Doofenshmirtz with his cute \"mindless animal\" look\nDoofenshmirtz_isn't_fooled_by_Dennis's_cute_look.png|But Doofenshmirtz isn't fooled as he knows he's a bad bunny\n</gallery>\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:O.W.C.A. agents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
