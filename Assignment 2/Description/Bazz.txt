Remember?|Bazz|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhile Bazz does find Link to be familiar at first, he has trouble placing where they've met before.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Gray|That said, this Hylian... I get the feeling I've seen him before... Perhaps a long time ago...}}|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> When he does finally recognize Link, he decides to test him with the Big Bad Bazz Brigade password to make sure he's correct.<ref>{{Cite|I must ask something of you, traveler. If you know it, speak it now. What is the Big Bad Bazz Brigade password?|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He starts with, \"Fluffy white clouds! Clear blue...\" After Link successfully guesses the word \"Zora\", Bazz will be convinced that the person he's speaking to is Link.<ref>{{Cite|Yes! There is no mistaking it! You are, indeed, the real Master Link!|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He asks Link what he's been doing for the past 100 years, but doesn't believe Link when he reveals he was sleeping.<ref>{{Cite|That said, you haven't changed at all... But what have you been doing for the last 100 years?|Bazz|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|As though you could sleep for that long. Hmph.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref>\n\nOnce Bazz has confirmed Link's identity, he'll answer questions for him.<ref>{{Cite|Now then, Master Link... What do you need from me?|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> Asking who Bazz is causes him to introduce himself,<ref>{{Cite|Me? I am Bazz.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> revealing that Link trained him when he was younger.<ref name=\"Blade\"/> Due to Link's training, Bazz was able to become the captain of the guard.<ref name=\"Captain\"/> He considers himself to be in Link's debt because of this.<ref>{{Cite|I am in your debt, Master Link.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about {{Term|BotW|King Dorephan|link}}, Bazz explains that he's the father of {{Term|BotW|Mipha|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Sidon|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|[King Dorephan?] He is the father of Princess Mipha and Prince Sidon.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He also reveals that things have been difficult for the {{Term|BotW|Zora|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Princess Mipha fell to {{Color|BotW Red|Calamity Ganon}}... 100 years ago. It has certainly been difficult ever since.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref>\n\nBazz is shocked to hear that Link has forgotten Mipha.<ref>{{Cite|Master Link...

Lady Mipha was...|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> but decides it would be better if he heard it from King Dorephan.<ref>{{Cite|... Actually, I think it would be best if you heard this from {{Color|BotW Red|King Dorephan}}.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"{{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Ruta (Quest)|link}}\" {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}} has been completed, he thanks Link for doing so.<ref>{{Cite|Master Link! Thank you!|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> While he believes that calming {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Ruta|link}} should have been his job as the captain of the guard, he's unable to handle {{Plural|BotW|Shock Arrow|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|As captain of the guard, that should've been my responsibility. But {{Color|BotW Blue|shock arrows}} are the one thing I just can't handle.|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> However, even though the trouble has passed, he still plans on protecting Zora's Domain.<ref>{{Cite|Even though {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}} has been appeased, I must not let my guard down... I must continue to serve and defend this domain as I always have!|Bazz|BotW}}</ref> He can also be seen in the {{Term|BotW|Throne Room|link}} as King Dorephan thanks Link.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nBazz's name is derived from ''Bass''{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Zora's Domain]]\n* [[Rivan]]\n* [[Gaddison]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hyruleans, Zora\n |characters= BotW\n}}\n\n[[es:Basun]]\n[[fr:S\u00e9bass]]\n[[zh-tw:\u65af\u516b\u5df4]]"
