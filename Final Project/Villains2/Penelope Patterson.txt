Her major talents involve balancing objects, riding a unicycle, and reciting Shakespeare all at the same time.\n==Role in the series==\nIn \"[[Trike X-5]]\", Penelope tries to show her \"superior\" unicycle-riding skills, but is outdone when Brianna uses her brother's tricycle to perform a stunt. In \"[[Sister Pact]]\", she tries to sabotage Brianna's audition for the Poise Posse but fails and is kicked out of the group for trying to do so. Like Janelle, she is commonly seen as a background character.\n\n<gallery>\nBrianna Penelope rivalry.jpg|The rivalry is evident.\nPenelope Shakespeare unicycle.jpg\nPenelope plate spin.jpg\nPenelope crowd's all yours.jpg\nPenelope creamed.jpg\nPenelope bow.jpg\nPenelope praise.jpg\nPenelope whos your escort.jpg\nPenelope laugh.jpg\nPenelope bye-bye.jpg\nPenelope failure.jpg|\"Failure...\"\nPenelope not happy.jpg\nPenelope sabotage.jpg\nPenelope hat tear.jpg\nPenelope loses cool.jpg\nPenelope flip out.jpg\nPenelope scolded.jpg\nPenelope dismissed.jpg|Penelope is dismissed from the Poise Posse.\nPenelope sad.jpg|\"But...I love PP.\"\nPenelope painted.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
