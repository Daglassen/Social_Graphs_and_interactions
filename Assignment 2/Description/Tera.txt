I am the oldest of the four sisters.|Tera|BotW}}</ref> Like the other Great Fairies, Tera will upgrade [[Link]]'s [[Armor]] in exchange for [[Material]]s.\n\nUnlike her sisters, Tera has several odd mannerisms; she occasionally uses [[Gerudo]] forms of greeting when Link visits her, and will inform him about various goings-on beneath the water of her fountain. When she first meets Link, she attempts to convince him that she is all-knowing, even offering to read his thoughts to prove her omniscience.<ref>{{Cite|I have been watching your activities from inside my bud all this time!
