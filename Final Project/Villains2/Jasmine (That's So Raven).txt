"\n[[File:Road to Audition.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]\n'''Jasmine''' is a character from the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[That's So Raven]]''. She appears in the episode \"[[The Road to Audition]]\".\n\n==History==\nShe, along with most of the school, tried to get the attention of Tony the janitor believing he was actually an undercover agent for the television series ''Undercover Superstars''. She is depicted as an arrogant, self-centered girl who is the best singer in the school. She is the main antagonist of the episode.\n\nShe was the first to sing him a song and was later told she was good enough for the show, just like everyone in the school. Unfortunately, he was actually undercover for the health department, and not ''Undercover Superstars''.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*She is similar to [[Amber Addison]] from ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', considering how they're both stuck up and like to think of themselves as excellent singers. They're both mean-girls as well.\n*It's unknown if she and Raven have put aside their rivalry since they were seen hugging towards the end of the episode.\n\n==See Also==\n*\"[[Theater Queen]]\"\n\n{{That's So Raven}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Bayside High School Student]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:That's So Raven characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
