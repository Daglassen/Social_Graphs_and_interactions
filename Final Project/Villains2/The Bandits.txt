John Wilkins|Lt. Wilkins]], [[Sergeant Harley]], [[Buldeo]], and [[Tabaqui (Jungle Book 1994)|Tabaqui]] looking for [[Mowgli]] in the jungle so as to capture him and make him lead them to a treasure from a city inhabited by monkeys called \"Monkey City.\" Tabaqui and two bandits are able to spot and capture Mowgli with a net but Mowgli struggles, fights back, and manages to escape.\n\nLater, the bandits ambush [[Colonel Geoffrey Brydon]], his daughter; [[Katherine \"Kitty\" Brydon|Kitty]], and [[Dr. Julius Plumford]] as they kill a few British soldiers. One British soldier serving as a coachman is seen killing a few bandits but Colonel Brydon is the only one able to shoot a few more dead with his gun until one of them shoots him on the leg.\n\nWhen Buldeo brutally removes Dr. Plumford from the caravan and is about to kill him with a dagger, Mowgli stops him by pushing him out of the way. Then, Mowgli's wolf friends including [[Grey Brother]] and [[Bagheera]] the black panther join the attack and kill the rest of the bandits while the others flee for their lives. Then, Buldeo and Tabaqui with some remaining bandits flee with Kitty and her father taken as hostages. Only two bandits, one Indian and one Sherpa, remain to attack Mowgli - the Indian one is overpowered and pushed aside and the Sherpa is bitten and then knocked unconscious when Mowgli throws him against a tree. \n\nThe bandits are not seen throughout the rest of the movie after this. It can be assumed that the ones Mowgli defeated and the ones that ran away for their lives were killed and probably eaten by Mowgli's animal friends or [[Shere Khan]] in the end.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\n\nIndianbanditslook.jpg|Bandits looking for [[Mowgli]]\nIndianbanditscatch.jpg|Trying to catch Mowgli\nIndianbanditsdefeat1.jpg|Indian Bandit defeat #1\nIndianbanditsdefeat2.jpg|Sherpa Bandit defeat #2\nIndianbanditdefeatagain.jpg|Indian Bandit defeat #3\nIndianbanditsattack.jpg|Ambushing [[Colonel Geoffrey Brydon]], [[Katherine \"Kitty\" Brydon|Kitty]], and [[Dr. Julius Plumford]]\nIndianbanditsshoot.jpg|Shooting and killing British soldiers\nIndianbanditsattack2.jpg|Attacking British soldiers 1\nIndianbanditsattack3.jpg|Attacking British soldiers 2\nIndianbanditsdeath1.jpg|Bandit death #1\nIndianbanditsdeath2.jpg|Bandit death #2\nIndianbanditsrun.jpg|Stealing a horse\nIndianbanditsdeath3.jpg|Bandit death #3\nIndianbanditsshootandaimatcolonel.jpg|Bandit aiming and shooting the Colonel\nIndianbanditsattack4.jpg|Still attacking\nIndianbanditsdeath4.jpg|Bandit death #4\nIndianbanditsdeath5.jpg|Bandit death #5\nIndianbanditsdeath6.jpg|Bandit death #6\nIndianbanditsdeath7.jpg|Bandit death #7\nIndianbanditsdefeat3.jpg|Indian Bandit defeat #4\nIndianbanditsdefeat4.jpg|Nepalese Bandit defeat #5\nIndianbanditsrunning.jpg|Running away\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]"
