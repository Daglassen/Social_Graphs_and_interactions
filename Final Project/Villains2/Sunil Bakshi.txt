He was portrayed by Simon Kassianides.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSunil Bakshi was deeply loyal to his HYDRA superiors, particularly Daniel Whitehall. He was even willing to kill himself rather than reveal any information to S.H.I.E.L.D. Bakshi presented himself with a calm, confident, and sophisticated personality.

While serving them, he went as an undercover HYDRA agent working with [[Doctor List]]. He was later killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jemma Simmons]], who had attempted to kill Ward.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBakshi Orders.png\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 2x05 - A Hen in the Wolf House - Bobbi and Sunil.jpg.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bakshi, Sunil}}\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:HYDRA agents]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
