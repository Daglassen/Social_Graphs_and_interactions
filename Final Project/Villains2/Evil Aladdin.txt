He then transports them to the center of Agrabah where the Evil Aladdin knocks the real one off a building. Aladdin then finds Evil Aladdin throwing tomatoes at two of civilians. When the two Aladdins fight again, Genie intercepts them, so Evil Aladdin summons [[Evil Genie|his own Genie]] to fight him. Aladdin then defeats Evil Aladdin by pulling a carpet he's standing on so he falls down a well. It is assumed that Evil Aladdin ceased to exist when the real Aladdin forced Evil Genie to return everything to normal.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nEvil Al.jpg\nWccc135.jpg\nWccc136.jpg\nwccc137.jpg\nwccc138.jpg\nwccc140.jpg\nwccc142.jpg\nShadow Aladdin.jpg\nwccc152.jpg\nwccc154.jpg\nWccc157.jpg\nwccc166.jpg\nwccc167.jpg\nwccc172.jpg\nwccc174.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]"
