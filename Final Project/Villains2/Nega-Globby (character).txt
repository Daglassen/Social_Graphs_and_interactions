He is the mutant doppelg\u00e4nger of the original [[Globby]] created by [[Di Amara]] when her assistant [[Chris (Big Hero 6)|Chris]] retrieved a sample of Globby's own substance and accelerated its tissue regeneration.\n==Background==\nWhen Honey Lemon sought to develop a cure for Globby, Chris broke into [[San Fransokyo Institute of Technology]] and retrieve a sample of Globby's substance. He takes it back to [[Sycorax]], where Liv Amara experimented on it due to the substance's self-regenerating capabilities.\n\nThe dark bluish blob became sentient, so Liv and Chris locked it up in one of the holding cells on Sub-level 9. When Chris was attempting to feed it, it quickly got out when the doors was deactivated and merging with one of Liv's experiments within the bio tanks, gaining a single red eye for sight. The Glob escaped and went on a rampage in San Fransokyo.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nNega-Globby is nearly identical to the original, except is slightly larger than Globby himself and it's gelatinous form is indigo slime, having a single cycloptic red eye.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBH6 Villains 2.0.PNG\nNega-Globby (Acid).jpg|Nega-Globby throwing acid\nNega-Globby 5.png\nNega-Globby 6.png\nNega-Globby 7.png\nNega-Globby 8.png|Nega-Globbyzilla vs. Globbysaurus-Rex\nNega-Globby 13.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
