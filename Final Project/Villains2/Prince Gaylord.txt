Well, I, Prince Gay lord, do hereby swear that he shall rue the day of his return.|Prince Gaylord}}\n\n'''Prince Gaylord''' is an antagonist from the ''[[Quack Pack]]'' episode, \"[[Leader of the Quack]]\".\n\n==Role in the episode==\nIn his tower, Prince Gaylord is first seen admitting his disgust for the return of [[Donald Duck]] as king of Quaintinia for having accidentally defeated a dragon years ago and plots to eliminate him so as to seize the throne for himself. His plans to eliminate Donald backfire with every attempt.\n\nWhen Prince Gaylord returns home, he captures [[Daisy Duck]] as his prisoner, who sneaked into his tower while he was away and who managed to find the same dragon named [[Nelly the Dragon|Nelly]] whom Donald accidentally defeated years ago. Disappointed that Nelly lost her fire when she was defeated by Donald long ago, Gaylord leaves to find some sweets, which literally bring fire into someone's belly (an experience he had earlier in the short) while Nelly has tea with Daisy and admits she is a nice dragon but a bit of \"a sucker for gifts,\" which explains her alliance with Gaylord. When Gaylord returns, Nelly tries to stand up to him: \"I am my own dragon. I choose for myself!\" as suggested by Daisy; only to fall into serving Gaylord again when he offers her the sweets, which bring back her fire; much to Gaylord's joy. Daisy manages to escape as Nelly spins around excited to have her fire back.\n\nNelly is next seen setting the villages on fire as she makes her way to regrettably eliminate Donald. Luckily, with Daisy's help, Donald manages to save himself from being burned by offering Nelly her favorite: chocolates. Then, a gift-offering war ensues between Donald and Gaylord until Donald finally wins by offering Nelly the crown since Donald is sick of being king and Nelly likes the outfit, therefore, making Nelly the new queen of Quaintinia. When Gaylord furiously demands she torches Donald and calls her a nincompoop, Nelly finally turns against him and sends him running away in flames; never to be seen or heard from again.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nGaylord Castle.jpg|Prince Gaylord's tower\nLotQ1.jpg\nLotQ2.jpg\nLotQ3.jpg\nLotQ4.jpg\nLotQ5.jpg\nLotQ6.jpg\nLotQ7.jpg|\"Don't just stand there, you nincompoop!\"\nLotQ8.jpg|\"Torch him!\"\nNelly6.jpg|Nelly turning on Gaylord\nLotQ9.jpg|Prince Gaylord's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Quack Pack}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Gaylord}}\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
