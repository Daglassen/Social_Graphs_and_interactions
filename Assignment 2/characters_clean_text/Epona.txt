Epona (pronounced /iˈpoʊ.nə/ ee-POH-nə) is a recurring character in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Biography ==


=== Ocarina of Time ===
Epona is first seen when she is just a foal at Lon Lon Ranch in Ocarina of Time, where she is raised by Malon. She is wild and untamed, running away when Link approaches, as only Malon can get close to her. After Malon teaches Link "Epona's Song", Epona stops running away and approaches Link. Malon then says that Epona has taken a liking to him.
Link then finds Epona seven years later when she has become a mare. However, things have taken a turn at the Ranch and Ingo is now in charge. Ingo plans to present Epona to Ganondorf, who he claims gave him ownership of the Ranch. At first, Epona will run from Link as if he is a stranger, but if he plays "Epona's Song", she will remember him and trot to his side. Link can then participate in a horse race against Ingo with Epona as his steed. If Link wins, Ingo will get furious, challenging him again while betting Epona herself on the outcome of the race. If Link wins, Ingo lets him keep Epona. However, Ingo then attempts to prevent Link from leaving with Epona by shutting the gates of the Ranch. Link can guide Epona to jump over the walls of the Ranch to escape into Hyrule Field. Afterwards, Link can play "Epona's Song" while in Hyrule Field to call her. During the ending credits, Epona is seen running across Hyrule Field, and is later seen next to Malon during the celebration of Ganondorf's defeat at Lon Lon Ranch.
While riding Epona, Link cannot get hurt by enemies and can only attack by using the Bow. He can also whip her to get up to six speed boosts, appearing on-screen as Carrots. The boosts can be used to jump over barriers and fences, such as in the aforementioned escape from Lon Lon Ranch after Ingo shuts the gates, and are restored after a few seconds. Epona can be used to jump across the broken bridge in Gerudo Valley and to play the Horseback Archery Range minigame in Gerudo's Fortress. She is also required to summon Big Poes in Hyrule Field. Despite this, obtaining Epona is entirely optional, as Link can also cross the broken bridge in Gerudo Valley using the Longshot.


=== Majora's Mask ===
Link is first seen riding Epona through the Lost Woods at the start of Majora's Mask. Epona is then startled by Tatl and Tael, causing Link to be thrown to the ground and knocked unconscious. The Skull Kid wearing Majora's Mask then appears and searches Link's body, finding the Ocarina of Time and taking it. When Link regains consciousness, the Skull Kid attempts to hide the Ocarina, but Link lunges at him in an attempt to get it back. The Skull Kid then leaps out of the way and onto Epona, galloping away on her afterwards. Link leaps after him but only manages to grab onto Skull Kid's leg. Epona continues to gallop along, dragging Link with them until he loses his grip. When Link finally catches up with the Skull Kid again, he tells him that he got rid of Epona because she did not listen to a word he said.
After completing the Snowhead Temple, Link finds Epona in Romani Ranch. If he visits the Ranch on the First Day, Romani teaches him "Epona's Song" and gives Epona back to Link after he practices shooting balloons while riding her. Epona is required to enter the Great Bay and Ikana Canyon since they are blocked by fences that only she can jump over. During the ending credits, Link is seen departing from Termina on Epona.
As in Ocarina of Time, enemies cannot hurt Link while riding on Epona, he can only attack by using his Bow, and he can get up to six speed boosts.


=== The Minish Cap ===
Epona can be seen in Hyrule Town carrying a wagon with Milk containers in The Minish Cap. She is owned by Malon, who sells milk to Link after he helps her and Talon find the Spare Key to their farm house. While Minish-sized, Link can communicate with Epona, who asks him to buy some Lon Lon Milk. Link can also Fuse Kinstones with her.


=== Twilight Princess ===
The name of Link's horse can be chosen in Twilight Princess, although the default name is Epona. She is seen and used very early in the game, aiding Link in his job as a rancher in Ordon Village, although Ilia is the one who takes care of her. Ilia gets angry when Link treats the horse poorly or she gets hurt. After the village is attacked by King Bulblin, Epona disappears. However, Link reunites with her later in Kakariko Village, where she runs around desperately attempting to throw off two Bulblins. Once the Bulblins are defeated, Link has to tame her and then ride her back to Ordon Village to ask Mayor Bo how to best the Gorons of Death Mountain. After returning to Kakariko Village, Link and Epona ride together to save Colin after he is kidnapped and taken into Hyrule Field by King Bulblin.
In most locations around Hyrule Field, Link can call Epona by blowing a Horse Grass or the Horse Call, which both play "Epona's Song". Unlike in previous games, Link can use various items while riding her, including the Sword. Additionally, Epona can provide short speed boosts like in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, appearing onscreen as spurs instead of Carrots. Epona is used when fighting against King Bulblin and during the third part of the final battle with Ganondorf. Wolf Link is able to speak with her, as with other animals.


=== Breath of the Wild ===
Link can obtain Epona in Breath of the Wild by scanning either the Super Smash Bros. Link or Twilight Princess Zelda 30th Anniversary Link amiibo. Unlike other horses in the game, Epona does not need to be tamed and can be immediately mounted. Once registered at a Stable, Epona cannot be obtained more than once through the amiibo, even if deceased as she can be revived by Malanya if she is registered when she dies. 
Like the Giant Horse, her mane cannot be groomed and she receives a special bridle and saddle called Epona Gear.
Though not stated in-game, Epona is the namesake of Epona Co., a 150 year old company that makes horse goods from horse gear to fine items like brushes and riding wear worn by stable workers. Their company logo can be seen on the hats of Stable workers and the base of the Horse statue at the Sanidin Park Ruins indicating they were involved in its construction. As a result, Epona is famous and legendary horse among the stable managers/innkeepers as they recognize her when Link registers her and will force Link to name her Epona as they will not accept any other name.

== Development ==
During the development of Super Mario 64, the development team had plans to include a horse, which were later moved to Ocarina of Time. The developers did not want controls to be difficult, so Epona was made to automatically jump over barriers if she has enough speed. To make the experience more entertaining, the carrot system was established, as well as mounted archery. The developers also wanted to include one-on-one battles and horseback swordplay, though such features did not appear until Twilight Princess. 
The scene where Epona jumps over the broken bridge in Gerudo Valley was specially requested by Shigeru Miyamoto. A similar scene is shown when Epona escapes from Lon Lon Ranch, which had more than one exit, so a cutscene was made for each. The idea of horses and these scenes were inspired by Western movies.


== Trivia ==
Various unnamed horses resembling Epona appear in the opening cinematics of Oracle of Seasons, Oracle of Ages, and The Wind Waker, as well as in The Field stage from Four Swords Adventures.
During development of Ocarina of Time, Link would use a whip to control Epona. After using the whip, Link would have to give her a carrot.


== Nomenclature ==
Epona is named after the Celtic Goddess of horses and fertility. It is built from the Celtic word epos, meaning "horse".
