He also convinces him to participate in a race.\n\n===Personality===\nEarl seems to enjoy picking on his rivals, as evidenced by his interactions with [[Pete]] in the episode \"[[Rally Round the Goof]]\". He is very arrogant; however, he appears to have a good business-sense, as someone ironically asked Pete for directions to Earl's car lot, indicating that Earl may offer better service than Pete.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nEarl is a heavy-set anthropomorphic cat with dark brown fur. He wears a blue jacket, a white collared shirt, and a red-and-orange striped tie.\n\n===Role in the series===\nHe is mostly mentioned by name, rather than seen. [[Pete]] and a man mention him in the episode \"[[Inspector Goofy]]\", with his first and only physical appearance being in the episode \"[[Rally Round the Goof]]\". He gets Pete to compete against him in a race, but loses. \n\nHe is mentioned once again in the episode \"[[Goof Fellas]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Another character by the name Earl Yokel makes an appearance in the episode \"[[Major Goof]]\". He is also the owner of a car lot; however, his physical appearance differs from that of Earl. It is unknown if he is the same character redesigned, or a completely different person.\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
