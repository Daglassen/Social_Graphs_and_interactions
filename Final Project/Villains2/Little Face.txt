"{{Infobox character\n|name =  Little Face\n|image = 96015-4994.jpg\n|films = ''[[Dick Tracy]]''\n|actor = Lawrence Steven Myers\n|fate = Gunned Down by [[Flattop Jones]]}}'''Little Face''' is one of [[Lips Manlis]]' thugs in ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. His face was only shown in extreme close-up, and his body was only shown from behind.\n\nMax Allan Collins' novelization of the film expands slightly on Little Face's role. Little Face came to prominence working under Lips, who considered him an old friend. [[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]] would recall an occasion inspired by the strip: Little Face once tried to evade him by hiding in a freezer, but he nearly lost his ears and hands to frostbite (they ended up heavily scarred).\n\nDespite his friendship with Lips, Little Face agreed to take money from [[Big Boy Caprice]] in exchange for helping to set up the 7th Street Garage massacre, as well as leaving the door open for Big Boy's gunmen. This proved a fatal mistake for Little Face, as [[Flattop Jones]] executed him along with the others.\n\n{{Dick Tracy}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Dick Tracy characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]"
