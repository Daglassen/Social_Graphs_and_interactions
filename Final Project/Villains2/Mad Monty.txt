Along with\u00a0[[Polly Lobster]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Clueless Morgan]], he is one of the main conspirators and henchmen to\u00a0[[Long John Silver (Muppets)|Long John Silver]]. His eyes peek out from his grungy stovepipe hat.\n\nMad Monty has a penchant for violence. In the song \"Sailing for Adventure\", Monty says that he loves to hang his victims and watch their faces turn blue as they suffocate and \"try to walk in the air\". Later, in the song \"Professional Pirate\", Monty says he likes \"taking things apart\" as evidence he could have been a surgeon. His name and attitude imply that Monty might be a violent psychopath.\n\nMad Monty is the only pirate of which a\u00a0PVC figure\u00a0was made. He is sculpted with Polly Lobster on his hat.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"169\">\nMad Monty in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Mad Monty in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nMonty sing There Was an Old Pirate in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Monty performing ''There Was An Old Pirate'' in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs Muppet Treasure Island''\nClueless Morgan catches Bad Polly in his lobster trap.jpg|Monty sees that Clueless got Bad Polly in his lobster trap\nKermit, Bad Polly, Mad Monty and Clueless Morgan in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Mad Monty with Kermit, Polly Lobster and Clueless Morgan in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nKermit and the crew from Muppet Treasure Island.jpg|Mad Monty, Kermit, Polly Lobster, Clueless Morgan, Big Snort and the rest of the Muppet Treasure Island cast in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nA still shot of Mad Monty in a circle of a closing sequence background of Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|A still snapshot of Mad Monty in a circle of a orange background for the closing credits of ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nA snapshot of Kermit and the Muppet Treasure Island cast in a circle of a closing sequence background.jpg|A still snapshot of Kermit and the Muppet Treasure Island crew in a circle of a orange background for the closing credits of ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nclueless5.jpg|Clueless Morgan, Polly Lobster, Mad Monty\nMonty def.jpg|Bad Polly, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan and other pirates defeat\nMuppets Treasure Island 41565 Medium.jpg|Mad Monty and other pirates\nSailing For Adventure 1996 .jpg|Bad Polly, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan singing \"Sailing For Adventure\"\nMovie-MTI-Promo04.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Muppet Treasure Island characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
