Because of this, he is a spoiled child, and is hated by the [[Wasabi Warriors]]. He shows most of his distaste toward Jack. In Dojo Day Afternoon, he calls the Wasabi Warriors \"losers\" and says they pretend to know karate, even though Arthur himself has little to no abilities in the art. At the end of the episode, he wanted to tear down the dojo, no matter what or who got in the way. In the end, his father grounded him for the very first time, Arthur not knowing what grounding is. Arthur is arguably the darkest character who opposed the Wasabi Warriors, wanting to tear down the dojo to win over them, even if that involved killing Jerry, Eddie Jack and Rudy.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Arthur}}\n[[Category:Kickin' It characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
