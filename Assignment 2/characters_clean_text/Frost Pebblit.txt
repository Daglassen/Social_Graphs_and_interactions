Frost Pebblits are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series. They are miniature versions of the Frost Talus.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Frost Pebblits are mainly found in snowy areas, such as the Hebra Mountains. Due to their coloring, they often blend in with their surroundings, and are somewhat difficult to spot until they become active. Their primary attack is moving toward Link and attempting to swipe at him with one arm.
Frost Pebblits can be fought similarly to their stone counterparts, except that coming into contact with one will cause Link to become frozen for a short period of time. This can be avoided, however, by throwing Remote Bombs from a distance, melting the Frost Pebblit's icy coating with a heat-based weapon such as Fire Arrows, or wearing a full set of Snowquill Armor that has been enhanced twice by a Great Fairy for the Unfreezable Set Bonus, which allows the Pebblit to be picked up and thrown in order to defeat it. Frost Pebblits will explode if held by Link for too long or when they're thrown.
Once killed, each one will drop a single piece of Flint, Amber, or Sapphire.
