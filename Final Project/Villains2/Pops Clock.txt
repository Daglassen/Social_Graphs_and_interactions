If not, they can go out of control, thanks to Pops, who felt taken for granted, and snapped, becoming sinister, insane, and evil. He threatened to wipe out the entire toon population, by causing toon time to become unstable, and ripping out gears, cogs, and other clock parts in the clock tower. [[Bonkers D. Bobcat|Bonkers]] and [[Fall-Apart Rabbit|Fall-Apart]] realized that they were about to \"go back to blank pieces of paper\" (which is like dying). After a long time of figuring out the answer, Pops knocked Lucky over which caused him to tumble into Bonkers and Fall-Apart, who, like his name states, fell apart. Bonkers put Fall-Apart together again and Fall-Apart said \"Thank you\". The heroes realized that the words were the key to controlling toon time. After Pops Clock turned everything back to normal, he informed the two toons about using \"Please\" and \"Thank you\", and he vanished into thin air.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 22.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 23.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}{{Bonkers}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Timepieces]]"
