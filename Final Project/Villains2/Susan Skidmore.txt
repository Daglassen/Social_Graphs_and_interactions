She is very stylish. She's often misusing the ants for her self-absorbed gain. She treats her students and staff like servants and henchmen. She is portrayed by [[Mindy Sterling]].</p>\n\n==<span style=\"line-height:19px;\">Personality</span>==\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">Skidmore is shown to be quite self-serving, such as when Olive wants to join a hippie group and yelling at her to get out so she can have the chicken wings all to herself. It seems that she has no idea what she truly looks like, for example when Fletcher shows her a mirror she thinks it's a painting. She is a bit cheap due to the wanting all the money as seen in ClairvoyANT. She doesn't do fundraising or any kind of charity work although because she doesn't want to give it all up. She is also exceptionally malicious and harsh to innocents, such as Olive and Gibson. An example is violently, spitefully and abusively threatening Chyna if she messed up the school speech, Chyna's tongue will get eaten by her raven. She holds no empathy, feelings or consideration for anybody except herself. She also has no moral code and is without honor.</p>\n\n==<span style=\"line-height:19px;\">History</span>==\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In ParticipANTs, she talks to Gibson when he arrives at the Activity Fair. She notices he no longer gets lost in the school, which is when Gibson shows her his GPS App, which he needs to learn Korean to use. Later, when she discovers Cameron and Fletcher's fake club, she wants in so that she can take short breaks and eat buffalo wings in a classroom which is a sign of her exaustion.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In The PhANTom Locker, she has Fletcher paint a picture of her as a gift to her new boyfriend who is a politician. She thinks that Fletcher made her look like an old lady in the painting, so Fletcher makes another painting of her on a bike. Chyna tells Fletcher to paint a picture of her <u>''inner''</u> beauty instead, so Fletcher makes another painting of her skeleton. She isn't pleased, but she does like the fact that she looks skinny when Chyna points it out.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In SciANTs Fair, in a prime example of the students hate and intolerance of her, her cell phone is stolen and she tearfully offers a $50 reward to whoever finds it. She also breaks the phone after being startled by some of the photo's on it.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In ClairvoyANT, she hosts the Webster Wolf awards and keeps her style through her students antics. Also, Olive is seen whispering that, \"Skidmore has too many evening gowns and no one will ask her out.\" Hence, the awards.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In ManagemANT, she host a home economics challenge for the students despite the large cost. She makes it better by modifying the original plans</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In PhilANThropy, she fires Gibson so they have enough money and funds when Chyna asks about the heating/cooling system. Then, in a rare sign of dissent from her students never ending torture, she fakes a phone call to a dissent line to tell them they can't lie to people to get money.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In The ReplacemANT, she hires Olive as the new history teacher since the old one left (AKA jumped out the window) and they don't have enough money to hire a real teacher because the board is corrupt. She also gives her a number for emergancies, but she doesn't actually answer due to overnight managment. In the end, she gets locked inside of the classroom with a bear, another sign of her students dislike of her.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In IgnorANTs Is Bliss, she tells Chyna and Fletcher that if Olive will lose her talent and have to go back to kindergarten. When she mercifully loses her memory and it it shown that she isn't quite pleased when Olive calls her grandma.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In SANTa's Little Helpers, she tells Chyna, Olive, and Fletcher to build toys that were supposedly going to little kids, but instead, she sells them online for her personal bank. After being confronted by them, she actually gives the phony toys to them as an apology.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In Body of EvidANTs, she tries to make herself look cooler with the help of Lexi.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:19px;\">In InfANT , she tells Fletcher, Violet, Olive, and Chyna to watch over her nephew while she goes shoe shopping.</p>\n\n==<span style=\"line-height:19px;\">Episode Appearances</span>==\n*ParticipANTs\n*The PhANTom Locker\n*SciANTs Fair\n*ClairvoyANT\n*ManagemANT\n*PhilANThropy\n*The ReplacemANT\n*IgnorANTs Is Bliss\n*SANTa's Little Helpers\n*Some EnchANTed Evening\n*Body of EvidANTs\n*InfANT\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n0015.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skidmore, Susan}}\n[[Category:A.N.T.
