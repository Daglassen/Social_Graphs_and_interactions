Clavia is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Clavia is a Hylian resident of Hateno Village. She can often be found on the dock behind the Kochi Dye Shop, thinking to herself. At night, she sleeps in the house with the Goddess Statue. During rain, she can be found taking stock in her home. She greets Link when they speak, and she occasionally remarks on her life in Hateno.
When Link first meets her, it takes Clavia a moment to realize that he is a traveler. She is excited to share something with him, but if Link decides to leave instead, she considers it a shame.
If Link decides to listen to her, Clavia will point to the cliffs and explain that she found a note in one of her old books at home.  The note holds cryptic instructions to a trial. Although Clavia admits that she does not understand the words, she guesses that the note refers to Afromsia Coast and excitedly thinks of the possibility of treasure waiting there. However, she is quick to recall with dismay that she has parental responsibilities and must remain in the village. Instead, she enlists Link to venture out and collect the reward for her, beginning the "Secret of the Cedars" Shrine Quest.
Link can return to her later, when she is occupied with thoughts of her village. She will hesitantly ask if the hero has found the so-called "treasure" the note spoke of. Realizing that it was rude to push this errand on Link, she asks if he might be open to sharing the reward. Regardless of Link's response, she will admit that she was only joking with him and that she is satisfied without it. She's disappointed by the "treasure" being an Ancient Shrine, as there's already one in the Village.
