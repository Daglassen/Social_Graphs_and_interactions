Shortly after, it's revealed that he took it without permission. When he notices an oncoming planet (possibly Jupiter), he tries to pull up, but ends up yanking the steering mechanism right off. The spacecraft, now out of control, bounces off of astronomical bodies and ends up taking many hits from an asteroid field before finally crash-landing on Earth.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nVector grounded.jpg|Vector ends up grounded.\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Quack Pack}}\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
