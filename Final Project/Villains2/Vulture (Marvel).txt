Sporting a vulture motif based on his namesake, Vulture is an opponent specializing in flight, and has established himself as one of [[Spider-Man]]'s most notable adversaries.\nHe makes his debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in the [[2017]] film, ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' as the main antagonist, portrayed by [[Michael Keaton]].\n\nVulture was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Marvel Animated Universe===\n====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====\nAdrian Toomes was a gothic teenager who was experimented on by [[Doctor Octopus]] at Oscorp, where he was injected with a serum derived from vulture DNA and got his memories erased, allowing him to transform into a vulture-human hybrid. He was later found by [[Spider-Man]], who declined his offer to join the new warriors. He was then found by [[Taskmaster]] and left his team, then once again he joined Doctor Octopus, who gave him [[Hydra]] armor. However, in the series finale, both he and [[Rhino]] were cured thanks to [[Spider-Man]].\n\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''====\nVulture appears as the main antagonist of the film. Initially a damage repair worker for [[Damage Control]], Adrian Toomes was present in the aftermath of the [[Chitauri]] attack on New York. While salvaging the remains of a Leviathan ship, Toomes' was halted from further work by [[Stark Industries]] who were assigned to finish the cleanup, despite Toomes' protests that the project was funding his workers' families. Unknown to the Stark representatives, Toomes and his personal crew stashed away some Chitauri technology before the rest was confiscated.\n\nBecause of Stark's businesses running out smaller ones like his own, Toomes developed a vendetta against [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. To carry out his schemes, Toomes used the Chitauri technology to develop a special flight suit and gadgets. With his lackeys, Toomes spent the next four years stealing technology and developing his company further.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the comics, Adrian Toomes was the first to take on the identity of the Vulture, and there ended up being three incarnations of the Vulture.\n*Michael Keaton is known for playing flying animal-based superbeings in the past, the first being [[Wikipedia:Batman|Batman]] and next as Birdman from ''[[Wikipedia:Birdman (film)|Birdman]]''. His role as Vulture marks the third time he has portrayed this character type.\n*[[Mark Hamill]] originally wanted to play The Vulture in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' only if [[Michael Keaton]] didn't want to play the part. Keaton initially turned down the offer, but later regretted just in time and got the role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/homecoming/star-wars-star-mark-hamill-really-wanted-to-play-the-vulture-in-spider-man-homecoming-a152588|title=STAR WARS Star Mark Hamill Really Wanted To Play The Vulture In SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING|website=Comic Book Movie|date=[[July 19]], [[2017]]}}</ref>\n*The Vulture was originally planned to be the main antagonist in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''Spider-Man 4'', but this never came into fruition due to the film being canceled in favor of Sony rebooting the franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/john-malkovich-confirms-he-was-the-vulture-in-sam-raimis-spider-man-4|title=John Malkovich Confirms he was the Vulture in Sam Raimi\u2019s SPIDER-MAN 4|website=Collider|date=[[April 16]], [[2010]]}}</ref> In Marb Webb's ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2,'' a division dubbed \"Special Projects\" in Oscorp Industries is shown to house the gadgets and equipment of various Spider-Man villains, namely [[Doctor Octopus]]' robotic tentacles, [[Rhino (Marvel)|Rhino]]'s weaponized armor, and Vulture's mechanical winged harness, indicating Vulture would appear in ''The Amazing Spider-Man 3.'' This was confirmed, and was also confirmed he would appear in a film featuring the [[Sinister Six]]. However, due to poor reception to ASM2 and Sony's 2014 hacking crisis, the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]/[[Marvel Studios]] partnership deal to include Spider-Man in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] was enacted instead, leading to ''Spider-Man: Homecoming, [[Spider-Man: Far From Home]],'' and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', the first of which Vulture finally made his cinematic debut.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nVulture 2.png\nvulture 3.png|Vulture with Octopus\nvulture 4.png\nvulture 5.png\nvulture 6.png\nVulture Cloak Taskmaster USMWW.png\nvulture 9.png\nvulture 10.png\nvulture 12.png\nvulture 13.png\nvulture 14.png\nVulture 15.png\nvulture 16.png\nVulture 17.png\nvulture 18.png\nvulture 19.png\nvulture 22.png\nvulture 23.png\nVulture 25.png\nvulture 26.png\nvulture 27.png\nvulture 29.png|Human's form\nvulture 30.png\nvulture 34.png\nvulture 36.png\nvulture 41.png\nvulture 44.png\nvulture 31.png\nvulture 32.png\nvulture 33.png\nvulture 45.png|Vulture's new armor\nvulture 46.png\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x04 - Iron Vulture - Vulture vs. Iron Patriot.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x25 - Graduation Day, Part One - Vulture, Doc Ock, Aunt May, Rhino and Spider-Man.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x26 - Graduation Day, Part Two - Peter Parker.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSpider-Man Homecoming 20.jpg|Vulture's weapon\nSpider-Man Homecoming 19.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming 15.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming 49.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming 47.jpg\nSpider-Man-Homecoming-63.png\nSpider-Man-Homecoming-62.png\nSpider-Man-Homecoming-61.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSpider-Man Homecoming Vulture Battle Concept Art.jpg\nFunko POP! - Spider-Man Homecoming - Vulture.jpg\nSMH Vulture.jpg\nSMH International Poster.jpg\nSMH Official Poster.jpg\nSMH concept 6.jpg\nSMH concept 5.jpg\nSMH concept 4.jpg\nSMH Character Poster 01.jpg\nThe Vulture in LEGO minifigure.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Vulture}}\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
