Give me a cracker.\"}}'''Polly Lobster''' is the secondary antagonist of the [[1996]] film\u00a0''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''. He is [[Long John Silver (Muppets)|Long John Silver's]] pet. Along with [[Clueless Morgan]] and [[Mad Monty]], he works for [[Long John Silver (Muppets)|Silver]].\n\nPolly was performed by [[Kevin Clash]], who is best known for performing [[w:c:muppets:Elmo|Elmo]]\u00a0from the children's puppet show ''{{WikipediaLink|Sesame Street}}''.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nPolly Lobster is a large red Muppet Lobster who has a hook instead of a claw on his right arm. He has big eyes and black eyebrows, a thick gray mustache, and a large armor on his back. The only clothes he wears are a striped necktie, green shorts, and boots.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn Muppet Treasure Island, Polly Lobster is first introduced as the pet of Long John Silver, who hired the crew for the treasure hunt in the name of Mr. Bimbo, the man who lives in the finger of [[Fozzie Bear|Squire Trelawney]]. Polly, along with the other pirates, plans to take the treasure for himself. As the first part of the plan, they took care of [[Samuel Arrow]] by tricking him into leaving the ship. As they arrived near the island where the treasure is, they kidnapped Jim Hawkins and took him to the island. Meanwhile, the other pirates who were still on the ship took over it.\n\nUnfortunately for Polly and the rest of the pirates, as they arrived at the point where the treasure was left, the gold wasn't there. Blaming Silver for it, Clueless Morgan gave Silver, under Polly's orders, the black spot. Making Polly and the others believe that the gates of Hell would open for them because they used a page from a bible for the black spot, Silver took leadership of the pirates again and Polly was back to being a minion. In the final fight with Hawkins, Gonzo, Rizzo, and the rest of the protagonists, Polly ends up losing with the other pirates. After that, he and all the other pirates were arrested.\n\n==Other appearances==\nPolly was also featured in several UK Spots on ''{{WikipediaLink|Muppets Tonight}}'' with his Muppet Treasure Island co-star Clueless Morgan. In these skits, the pair work as bartenders seen through the eyes of Mr. Callahan.\n\nPolly has most recently appeared in the ''Muppet Snow White'' comic book as a bouncer at a nightclub alongside his old castmates Clueless Morgan and Mad Monty.\n\nPolly appears as a gulag 38B in ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''.\u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Polly says \"What's next, the dancing singing mouse and his amusement park?\", he mentions [[Mickey Mouse]] and the [[Disneyland]] park.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBad Polly in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Bad Polly in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nBad Polly singing Old Bad Polly in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Bad Polly and the pirates perform ''Old Bad Polly'' in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nBad Polly in the ocean with fishes, clams, oysters, and a shark in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Bad Polly underwater with clams, oysters, fishes and a shark during ''I'm A Rock'' song in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nClueless Morgan catches Bad Polly in his lobster trap.jpg|Bad Polly is caught in Clueless Morgan's lobster trap\nKermit, Bad Polly, Mad Monty and Clueless Morgan in Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|Bad Polly with Kermit, Mad Monty and Clueless Morgan in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nKermit and the crew from Muppet Treasure Island.jpg|Bad Polly, Kermit, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan and the rest of the cast from Muppet Treasure Island in ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nA still snapshot of Bad Polly in a circle of a closing sequence background of Muppet Treasure Island Sing-Alongs.jpg|A still snapshot of Bad Polly in a circle of a orange background for the closing credits of ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nA snapshot of Kermit and the Muppet Treasure Island cast in a circle of a closing sequence background.jpg|A still snapshot of Bad Polly, Kermit, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan and the rest of the Muppet Treasure Island crew in a circle of a orange background for the closing credits of ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island''\nLonjohn and polly.jpg|Long John Silver and Bad Polly\nPolly2.jpg|Bad Polly in muppets tonight\nClueless5.jpg|Clueless Morgan, Polly Lobster, Mad Monty\nMuppets Treasure Island 41565 Medium.jpg|Polly and Other Pirates\nMonty def.jpg|Bad Polly, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan and Other Pirates Defeat\nMuppetsnowwhite3polly-300x214.jpg|Bad Polly and Gonzo in Muppets Snow White\nSailing For Adventure 1996 .jpg|Bad Polly, Mad Monty, Clueless Morgan Singing \"Sailing For Adventure\"\nMovie-MTI-Promo04.jpg|Polly with [[Clueless Morgan]], Mad Monty, [[Long John Silver]], [[Old Tom]] and Mr. Bitte\nMTI-Promo-Dangling.jpg\nLong john and polly.jpg\nClueless3.jpg\nPollydevelopment.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n[[Category:Muppet Treasure Island characters]]\n[[Category:Crustaceans]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:The Muppets characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
