The most well known and recurring Disney incarnation of the creature is the one from the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] attraction at [[Disneyland]], known by the nickname of '''Harold'''.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\n\n==== Matterhorn Bobsleds ====\nNicknamed Harold, this yeti is a resident of the [[Matterhorn]] mountain in the [[Switzerland|Swiss alps]]. It is unknown how or when the yeti would have done so (especially considering it is a cryptid from the Himalayas) but it is known to be deeply and violently territorial.\n\nOver the course of its life in the Matterhorn it has seen a large number of human intruders. This includes humans in bobsleds, the Wells mountaineering expedition, Swiss natives with alphorns, and even [[Skyway|skyway buckets]] pass through its domain. Many of these were violently attacked by the yeti's hand and used to decorate its lair within the mountain.\n\n==== [[Expedition Everest]] ====\nNicknamed '''Betty the Yeti''' or '''the''' '''Disco-Yeti''' by guests, this yeti is the legendary guardian of the Himalayan mountains, said to reside in the Forbidden Mountain. It is unclear to what extent the yeti is a mythical protector and to what extent it is simply an animal, but regardless it causes harm to those which dare disturb the Forbidden Mountain.\n\nIn the village of Serka Zong at the mountain's base, an old train line originally belonging to the Royal Anandapur Tea Company was constructed through the Himalayas. However, the train lines closed in the first place due to incidents in the 1930s where the Yeti attacked the trains moving through its territory in the Forbidden Mountain.\n\nSince this time, many journeyed to the forbidden mountain and many had claimed encounters with the feared yeti. Notably there was the League of Adventurers which tried to build passages through the mountain in the 1930s. Additionally there was the, \"Lost expedition\" which had its camp found in shatters with a broken camera containing blurred photos of the yeti.\n\nThe tea trains were re-opened by Himalayan Escapes, a tourism company hoping to use the trains as transport to the Base Camp at Mount Everest. However when the trains once more became active, so too did the yeti's wrath.\n\n===Development History===\n\n==== The Cryptid ====\nIn real-life, the Yeti is a legendary ''cryptid'' (animal/being of unconfirmed/dubious existence) which is said to inhabit the mountains of Himalayas. It originates from the folklore and myths of the Himalayan region which have been active for centuries with it traditionally being referred to as: ''g.ya' dred, Yach\u00ea'', and ''g.ya''' which would later be anglicized as, \"Yeti\". Most traditional names referencing the creature being comparable to a bear or a legendary hybrid of man and bear, specifically the Himalayan brown-bear.\n\nIn 1921, a group of British mountaineering military officers coined the term, \"The Abominable Snowman\" in reference to a series of large tracks found in the snows, resembling those of a giant human or bear footprint. According to the British documents, their sherpa proposed the tracks might have belonged to, \"Metoh-kangmi\" which the British took to mean, \"Abominable Snowman\" while in reality it translated to, \"Man-Bear of the Snows\". The iconography of the yeti as an, \"Ape-Man\" was largely manufactured by Western pop-culture due to a trend of colonists altering regional cultural traditions into said caveman-like monsters (E.G., the Sasq\u2019ets cultural practice of nomadism of indigenous [[Canada]] being reinterpreted as the monstrous [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]]).\n\nFollowing this, interest in the yeti grew which lead to large amounts of media regarding religious objects such as a yeti scalp, yeti hand-bone, yeti fur, yeti feces and even a yeti mummy being in possession of Tibetan religious organizations. When tested for DNA, the bones came back as belonging to Himalayan brown bears, the mummy as being of a Himalayan brown-bear, most of the fur/hair as belonging to Himalayan brown-bears with the infrequent yak hair, teeth belonging to the atheistic black-bear, and the scalp being made from an elk or fox-hide. It should be noted that atheistic black-bears and Himalayan brown bears are both native to the region, live in high altitudes, have many bones virtually identical to human bones (namely their claws), and can walk on their hind-legs. Furthermore it should also be said that any observation of the yeti or any other fauna of the Himalayas would be altered by intense winds, snows, and the human brain being continuously deprived of oxygen.\n\n==== Matterhorn Bobsleds ====\nThe Abominable Snowman was first introduced to the Matterhorn Bobsleds for it's 1977 refurbishment. According to ''The Disney Mountains: Imagineering at its Peak'', plans existed for the creature to be installed as part of the original 1959 attraction, but budget crunches and scheduling deadlines lead the concept to be shelved. Other historical sources have suggested that the original Snowman figures were repurposed from [[Gorilla Raiders|gorilla figures]] originally built for the [[Jungle Cruise]].\n\nNew Snowman figures were installed in 2015 as part of Disneyland's 60th Anniversary. This new animatronics presented a more expressive creature with a wider, more fluid range of motion and less aesthetically synthetic design. An additional effect was added to the lift-hill where guests saw a CGI animation of the yeti following them behind transparent ice.\n\n==== Expedition Everest ====\nThe Yeti built for Expedition Everest was the culmination of extensive research of the Yeti's role in Nepalese and Tibetan culture and primatology to create a believable animal. These influences included the ''Gigantopithecus'' often cited as a potential identity for large ape cryptids, as well as the snub-nosed langur, a high-altitude monkey living in the mountains of Sichuan. The animatronic figure built for the attraction's final scene would be one of the largest and most advanced Audio-Animatronics figures ever built for a Disney attraction.\n\nMost of the figure's weight would be held up by a slide and boom structure emerging from its back. It was powered by a 3000 psi hydraulic thruster that could be recharged in 20 seconds and the combined thrust of all the figure's linear actuators working together could put out a force equivalent to a jet engine. Because of this, the support base for the figure and it's boom would be kept separate from the structures of the mountain and the ride track. However, problems with this support structure would result in the figure being kept a static \"B-Mode\" for years.\n\nThis B-Mode uses strobe lights and fans to convey movement, a back-up plan that has resulted in fans nicknaming the figure \"Disco Yeti\". Plans to fix the figure have existed for some time, but with Animal Kingdom's low guest capacity, these have been benched for some time.\n\n==[[Disney Parks]]==\n\n=== [[Disneyland]] ===\n\n====[[Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!]]====\nOne of the original yeti animatronics from Matterhorn Bobsleds makes a cameo in the queue area of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!]]'' as part of the [[Collector|Tivan]] Collection.\n====[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]====\nA yeti appears on the Matterhorn Bobsleds at [[Disneyland]] as the main antagonist of the ride. It is sometimes referred to as Harold and it exists as three Audio-Animatronic figures to roar at the riders. One can be seen on both tracks, while the other two can be seen on their respective tracks. In addition to the figures, each track has its own set of glowing red eyes that belong to the monster.\n\nWhen Harold was first introduced to the attraction in 1978, the marketing campaign focused around the mystery of the monster now lurking in the caves of the Matterhorn Bobsleds. \"Fleeting sightings\" of the creature put him between seven and nine feet tall, with footprints being measured to be eight inches wide and eighteen inches long, and a thunderous roar being measured 6.9 on the Richter scale. Footprint casts of the Yeti \"discovered by Matterhorn mountaineers\" were put on display on the queue path around the mountain.\n\nIn 2015, to celebrate Disneyland's 60th anniversary, the old yetis were replaced with new ones that move more fluidly and with a less limited range of motion. As the cars go up the initial lift hill, the Yeti also now peers at the guests through thin layers of ice. After roaring a few times, he follows the guests to the peak of the mountain. In both of his appearances as an actual animatronic, he is now hidden behind a few rocks from the waist down.\n\nThough he was initially depicted as attacking riders unprovoked, it was stated that the new incarnation of the yeti is simply trying to protect his environment.\n\n=== [[Shanghai Disneyland]] ===\n\n====[[Camp Discovery|''Camp Discovery'']]====\nPictures of the Yeti figure can be seen at Shanghai Disneyland's Camp Discovery attraction, taken from a 1930s expedition by the [[League of Adventurers]] which were trying to help build trails through the Himalayas.\n\n=== [[Walt Disney World]] ===\n\n==== [[Disney's Blizzard Beach|Cross Country Creek]] ====\nIn this Blizzard Beach attraction is an ice-cave containing several cave-etchings of unknown origin.  One of these carvings depicts the yeti in-front of the Forbidden Mountains, attacking a pair of humans.\n\n====[[Expedition: Everest]]====\n[[File:Expedition-Everest-Yeti-783404.jpg|thumb|250px|Animatronic Yeti figure.]]\nThe Yeti is, again, the main antagonist of this rollercoaster at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]. Its presence can be felt throughout the queue where it is represented with statues, monuments, and even a wood carvings of its foot-print.\n\nThe Yeti Museum featured in the attraction's queue also chronicles a failed 1982 expedition to the Forbidden Mountain with blurry photographs of the angry Yeti and the battered remains of the climbers' camp. Despite this evidence and the warnings of the Yeti Museum's curator, Himalayan Escapes does not believe in the Yeti and thinks their rail service is perfectly safe.\n\nAfter the train sets off, it climbs up the mountain, passing through an ancient temple with artwork of the yeti and many offerings left by the people of the region. At the top, it makes a turn to find the tracks ahead have been torn up by the Yeti. Then the train reverses into a cave (via powerful switches). After going a little ways, the riders see the Yeti's shadow as it starts to tear up more tracks. Soon another set of switches activate and the Yeti's shadow disappears as the train goes down an 80 foot drop. After the train makes a turn at the bottom of the drop, it enters a cave, where riders hear the Yeti's roar. After making two loops outside, the train is then lifted back into the mountain for the last time where riders encounter the yeti face to face.\n\nThe vocal effects for the Yeti were provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]].\n\n====[[Skipper Canteen]]====\nOne of the books found in the Skipper Canteen's library is ''Expedition Everest: The Search for the Yeti'' by [[Harrison Hightower III]]. Hightower being a character from [[Tokyo]]'s incarnation of the [[Tower of Terror]] who is well known for his morally questionable acts of grave-robbing, colonial theft, and big-game hunting. This seems to imply that before his demise in 1899, Hightower attempted to find the yeti, likely to try and put on display in his [[Hotel Hightower|collection]].\n\nIn the meta element of the allusion, this is in-reference to Harrison Hightower III's actor being imagineer Joe Rhode who also was the lead developer behind Expedition Everest.\n\n==== [[Wilderness Explorers (Animal Kingdom)|Wilderness Explorers]] ====\nIn this attraction, members of the [[Wilderness Explorers]] must learn about the culture of the yeti from locals of Serka Zong to gain a, \"Yeti Badge\".  Said yeti badge depicts the Matterhorn incarnation of the yeti with additional illustrations of the beast being in the Wilderness Explorers guidebook.\n\n== Appearances in Other Media ==\n\n===TV shows===\n====''[[DuckTales]]''====\nA female yeti guest stars in the episode \"[[Lost Crown of Genghis Khan (DuckTales)|Lost Crown of Genghis Khan]]\", clad in jewels and featuring a very different design from the Yetis that would be used in the video games ''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'' and [[DuckTales Remastered]]. She is also a more traditionally designed Yeti in contrast to the more humanoid design from the original [[Carl Barks]] storyline that the episode is an adaptation of.\n\nAt the beginning she scares away throwing huge snowballs at [[Pete|Genghis Khan]] and his army while she was threatened to death and finds Genghis Khan's crown lying in the snow, and claims it.\n\n====''[[The Replacements]]''====\nA Yeti appeared in the final episode, \"[[Irreplaceable]]\".\n\n====''[[The Emperor's New School]]''====\nThe Yeti makes a brief cameo in the episode \"[[Rabbit Face]]\"; when [[Yzma]] and [[Kronk]] ride to their secret lab.\n\n====''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''====\nA Yeti is seen chasing [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] in the episode \"[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\", and again during the song \"[[Winter Vacation]]\".\n\n====''[[The 7D]]''====\n\n====''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''====\nThe Yeti (in his original Disneyland design) chases [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] down a swiss mountain in \"[[Yodelberg]]\".\n\n====''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]''====\nA group of Yeti family is seen in the 35th episode, \"Baby Yeti!\". They were introduced by [[Minnie Mouse]]'s nieces [[Millie and Melody Mouse]] until learned to work together after a giant snowball sends baby Yeti into the middle of a frozen lake.\n\n====''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''====\nA friendly Yeti named Gary appeared as a concierge in the 12th episode, \"[[Shangri-La-Di-Da]]\" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], alongside an entire resort staff of yetis.\n\n===Printed Media===\n====''[[Kingdom Keepers II: Disney at Dawn]]''====\nIn this book, the Expedition Everest Yeti is in fact a prison cell for [[Chernabog]] who is being rescued by [[Maleficent]] whilst [[Finn Whitman]], [[Amanda Lockhart|Amanda]] and [[Jessica Lockhart]] tried to stop them from escaping. Finn attempts to stop Maleficent who is freeing Chernabog. The yeti grabs Finn and prepares to eat him. They escape the cavern when the coster comes through and they hop on.\n\n===Video games===\n====''[[Matterhorn Screamer]]''====\nIn this 8-bit computer game, the Yeti is an enemy in Goofy's quest to climb the Matterhorn.\n\n====''[[Virtual Magic Kingdom]]''====\nThe Yeti was one of six characters in the game that would provide daily points for visiting, being located in an ice cave in the Matterhorn.\n\n====''[[Disney's Magical Quest 3 starring Mickey and Donald]]''====\nA male yeti known as [[Furry Ice Beast]] serves as a boss of the level ''Snowflake Mountain'' as well as a minor villain.\n\n====''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''====\nThe Yeti and many copies of himself appear as enemies in the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] mini-game.\n\n====''[[Epic Mickey]]''====\nAccording to ''The Art of Epic Mickey'', in early concepts for the game, the [[Mad Doctor]] was to have a version of the Disneyland audio animatronic Yeti as a bodyguard. In later concepts, he was supposed to be found at [[Mickeyjunk Mountain]] and serve as a battle armor for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]. Despite these two possibilities, the Yeti was eventually scrapped from the game.\n\n==== ''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]] and [[DuckTales Remastered]]'' ====\nYeti appears in the [[Himalayas|Himalaya]] Mission to collect [[Lost Crown of Genghis Khan|The Lost Crown of Genghis Khan]] as The Abominable Snowwoman as the last boss of the level (The first being [[Flintheart Glomgold]]).\n\n==Gallery==\n===Theme Parks===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMatterhorn yeti.jpg|The Old 1977 Yeti in Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland\ndfghderer.jpg\nMatterhorn Bobsleds Yeti (2015).jpg|CGI render of the 2015 Matterhorn Yeti\nharold 2015.PNG|2015 Matterhorn Yeti\nEE yeti 1.jpg|Yeti near the end of Expedition Everest\nEE yeti 2.jpg|The Yeti's shadow just before the main drop of Expedition Everest\nEE yeti 3.jpg|Close-up of the Everest Yeti's face\n</gallery>\n\n===Other Media===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSnowMonster.jpg|Yeti as he appeared in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' animated short \"[[Yodelberg]]\"\n6765 Harold-1 jpg-500x0.jpg\n2630 Harold-2 jpg-500x0.jpg\n23-days-13-1209-andy-suriano.png\nMickey Mouse issue 311 Matterhorn cover.png|The Yeti has a cameo on the \"legacy\" cover to ''[[Mickey Mouse (comic book)|Mickey Mouse]]'' #310\nUncleScrooge 416 Matterhorn variant.jpg\nMickeyMouse 319 Matterhorn variant.jpg\nTumblr myi5hv7Zq11r3jmn6o1 1280.jpg\nEmojiBlitzSnowman.png|Yeti's emoji for ''[[Disney Emoji Blitz]]''\nDisney Emoji Blitz App Icon Halloween.png|Yeti on the Halloween 2016 app icon\nGiving a Yeti a Shower.jpg|Yeti's cameo appearance during \"[[Winter Vacation]]\" from \"[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\"\nYeti Chasing Doof.jpg|[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] running from the Yeti\nThum.png|Character model from Kinect Disneyland Adventures\nVlcsnap-2013-05-06-16h42m38s24.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-06-16h43m20s23.png|Yeti in ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''\nVmk yeti.jpg|Yeti in ''[[Virtual Magic Kingdom]]''\nHaroldInMatterhornScreamer.png\nMatterhorn Screamer title.png\nSnow Monster NES.png\nLegend of the Three Caballeros 2.jpg\nGary The Yeti Legend of the Three Caballeros 76.4.jpeg|In ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''\nYetiByCarlBarks.png|Carl Barks's Yeti from ''The Lost Crown of Genghis Khan''\nLostcrownofgenghiskhan.jpg|The Yeti in the [[DuckTales]] adaptation of ''[[Lost Crown of Genghis Khan (DuckTales)|Lost Crown of Genghis Khan]]''\nS2e08a girl yeti as sneezy blowing out fire.png|Yeti family in ''[[The 7D]]''\nS2e08a grumpy expaining that yetis don't like having voices.png\nTim-n-Pum Yeti.png|The Yeti in [[Virtual Safari#Virtual Safari 1.5|Timon & Pumbaa's Virtual Safari 1.5]]\nYeti ENS.png|The Yeti in [[The Emperor's New School]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAbominable Snowman Flocked POP.jpg|Funko Pop\n$(KGrHqJ,!loFDcSDpimEBRIV5CoiHw~~60 3.jpg|Plush\nDisco Yeti.jpg|A fan-produced piece based on Disco Yeti, a fan nickname for Expedition Everest's malfunctioning Yeti figure\nMatterhornpin2000.jpg\nGoofyyeti.jpg\nStitchyeti.png|[[Stitch]] as the Yeti\nYetiMation1.jpg\nYetiMation2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the French dub of ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', [[Bigfoot]] is renamed \"the Yeti\".\n*[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge]] has an homage to the Yeti in ''[[Dok-Ondar]]'s Den of Antiquities'' where a taxidermy Wampa is arranged in a position mirroring the Matterhorn Yeti.\n*Unlike most depictions in which it has white fur, the Yeti is described as having brown or reddish-brown fur.\n*The yeti is similar to the [[Spirit of Big Thunder|Thunderbird]] from [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]].
