Shibo is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Shibo can be found at the Dueling Peaks Stable with his family. He normally stands outside with his twin brother, Darton outside the Horse pen beside the Stable. When approached, he speaks with Darton about whether Link is interested in Horses. The two conclude that he must then be a customer to the Stable.
The two offer to share their knowledge of Horses with Link. Shibo offers insight on how to catch Horses by sneaking up on them. Shibo will also inform Link that spotted Horses possess an even temperament and are easy to tame whereas single-color horses are wilder and more difficult to train. Shibo and Darton's father, Rensa, also gave the two advice on what kind of Horse is difficult to train, and which to start with. When asked about how to train a Horse properly, Shibo points out that a Horse will not be obedient at first and must be soothed at first and when it performs well.
At night, Shibo will go inside the Stable to sleep. While asleep, Shibo will count spotted Horses. When he wakes up, Shibo will attempt to beat Darton to the Horse pen.
