=== Breath of the Wild ===

Patricia is Lady Riju's favorite Sand Seal. She is blue and has a bow in her hair. Patricia was a gift to Riju from her mother before she passed.
Patricia can be found in the southwestern corner of Gerudo Town, just to the left of Riju's throne. If offered fruit, she will share her wisdom with Link. She likes Wildberries in particular. Her messages can only be translated by those who can truly communicate with her, usually the Gerudo, Padda. Patricia and Riju assist Link in getting near the Divine Beast Vah Naboris while disabling its legs with Bomb Arrows to access the entrance to the Divine Beast.
