His role is mainly to cut down trees throughout [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|Fairy Tale Forest]]. He tried to cut down the [[Magic Gnome]]'s tree, but was stopped by [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]] after seeing how big he had become. Next, he cut down a tree near a bridge and the tree fell down destroying the bridge. Then recently, he tried to cut down Old Knotty so a new road can go from the king's castle directly to the lake, but it too came to a halt when the residents of the forest protested the cutting of the tree. It was [[Prince Charming (Goldie and Bear)|Prince Charming]] who came and put an end to the protests by changing the road plan. Instead of going straight through the tree's location, it would go around the tree.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
