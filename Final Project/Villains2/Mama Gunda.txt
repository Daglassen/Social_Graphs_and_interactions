She is short in both height and temper.\n\nShe does not like it when her sons fight and always scolds them for doing so by shouting, \"LIPS!\" and pulling them down to her eye level by their bottom lips and, as soon as they agree to stop fighting, she release their lips and both collapse. Mama Gunda is clearly not all bad though since when [[Kala]] and the infant gorillas are almost knocked off the waterfall, she and her sons are quite dismayed, it clearly being an accident.\n\nWhen [[Zugor]]\u00a0compliments her eyes during a scuffle, Mama Gunda becomes smitten, redeeming herself,\u00a0and becomes his mate, moving in with him along with her sons.\n\n==Role in the film==\nMama Gunda and her sons [[Uto and Kago]] live trapped in a canyon, believing the only way out to be blocked by a monster they only know as the [[Zugor]]. They have heard it is horrible howling, but never seen it \u2013 which is because Zugor is just an elderly male gorilla howling through a log to amplify his voice and make others leave him alone by scaring them off.\n\nWhen they learn this, Mama Gunda is angered and shocked that her and her sons were stuck in the valley for nothing. She then leads her sons to attack and destroy Zugor's home, then moves on\u00a0to attempt to take over Tarzan's tribe, planning to replace [[Kerchak]] as the alpha male of the tribe with her own sons. Being met partway by Kala, some young gorilla babies, Tarzan, and Zugor, there is a brief scuffle between Zugor and Mama Gunda, during which Zugor accidentally lets the beans spill that he thinks Mama Gunda has beautiful eyes. This stuns Mama Gunda as she had never been complimented before and they immediately fall for each other. Mama Gunda then orders her sons to stop fighting\u00a0and tells them they shall never fight with anyone again before leading them off to rebuild Zugor's home so they can all live together as their own tribe.\n\n==Trivia==\n* It is unknown who her previous mate was or what became of him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2003.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2008.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2021.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2032.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2034.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2038.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2065.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2076.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2174.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2455.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2489.jpg\nTarzan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2665.jpg\nTarzan II Mama Gunda's Sons.jpg\nMama-gunda.png\nTarzan gunda.png|Mama Gunda's reformation\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tarzan}}\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]"
