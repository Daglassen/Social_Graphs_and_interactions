In all of his incarnations, he has the ability to control minds, which he uses to further his villainous schemes. Since Disney bought Marvel he appeared in an episode of ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' controlling Tony Stark. A much darker version appeared in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', wherein he uses\u00a0his powers to inflict suffering on others such as forcing people to kill or maim themselves in various brutal or gruesome ways. He also used his powers to abuse women, such as he did with Jessica Jones (leading to her retiring from superheroics and turning to hard drinking as a means of coping).\nKilgrave was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Joe Orlando.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nJessica Jones Purple Man Poster.jpg\nJessica Jones - 1x05 - AKA The Sandwich Saved Me - Photography - Kilgrave.jpg\nJessica Jones - 1x06 - AKA You're a Winner! - Photography - Kilgrave.jpg\nJessica Jones - 1x09 - AKA Sin Bin - Photography - Kilgrave.jpg\nPurple Man Proposal One.png|The Purple Man as he appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Jessica Jones characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
