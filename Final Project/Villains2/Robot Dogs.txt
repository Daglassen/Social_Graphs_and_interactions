After saving Spunky the kitten and snatching the remote from Nimnul, Nimnul ordered two of his Robot Dogs to fetch the remote while the badly damaged dog was told to get rid of Spunky hanging on to Nimnul's rear but due to its bad damage, it began to focus on Spunky and Nimnul thus began a chase between the [[Rescue Rangers]] and the two Robot Dogs and another one between Nimnul and the badly damaged dog. With the Professor's remote in the hands of the Rescue Rangers, they were able to defeat the two Robot Dogs while the badly damaged one was able to swallow the Professor whole (after being stuck to Spunky again); missing Spunky and then went to sleep with the Professor swearing retaliation on him and the world and \"wondering where his can opener is.\"\n\nThe Robot Dogs also appear as enemies in the first stage of the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (video game)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' NES game.\n\n===''[[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]''===\nThey also appear as villains in ''[[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery widths=150 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nCNIrobotdogs3.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs4.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs13.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs14.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs17.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs21.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs26.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs27.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs35.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs36.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs38.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs41.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs42.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs45.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs46.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs48.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs52.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs56.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs57.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs60.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs70.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs75.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs80.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs87.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs93.jpg\nRobot Dogs.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs102.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs108.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs117.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs125.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs133.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs144.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs151.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs163.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs168.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs171.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs175.jpg\nRobot Dogs 2.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs193.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs204.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs206.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs211.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs221.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs223.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs233.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs243.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs250.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs252.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs271.jpg\nRobotdogdefeat1.jpg|1st Robot Dog's defeat\nCNIrobotdogs283.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs289.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs292.jpg\nRobotdogdefeat2.jpg|2nd Robot Dog's defeat\nCNIrobotdogs300.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs301.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs313.jpg\nCNIrobotdogs315.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery widths=150 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center bordercolor=transparent>\nDSA Robot Dog.png|Model for [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nRescue Rangers textless NES cover art.png|Video game cover art\nDaleFoxRobotdog.jpg|Comic book appearance\n</gallery>\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
