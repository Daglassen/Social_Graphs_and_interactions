When Wittgenstein is later revived by [[Radio]]'s WFC 11-12-55 tube, the viruses automatically get destroyed (though a few remaining ones form the word \"Yipe!\" before they too are destroyed) and are never\u00a0seen again throughout the rest of the movie.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Viruses are similar to the [[w:c:mario:Virus|Viruses]] from the Nintendo puzzle video game ''{{WikipediaLink|Dr. Mario}}''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nSUNP02.JPG|Viruses' defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Brave Little Toaster}}\n[[Category:The Brave Little Toaster characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
