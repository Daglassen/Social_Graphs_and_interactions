He can also be viewed as Dragaunus' second in command, though the window is pretty wide. His cruel nature is mechanically and technologically minded, and he believes that brute force is the only means of victory. He often builds weapons and vehicles and directly uses them against the Ducks. He scoffs the dark magic of the ancient Saurians, but Dragaunus seems a little more tolerant and opens to his ideas as a result. However, when he fails, he gets little better treatment than the others in the group.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lizards]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Reptiles]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
