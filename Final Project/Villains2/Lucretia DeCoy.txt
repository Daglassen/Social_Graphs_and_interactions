[[Tanya Vanderflock|Tanya]] is the only one who knows who she was, but she prevents her from revealing that she is a spy by tying her to the top rafters of the Pond. When she entered, both Nosedive and Duke fell head over heels for her, and they both made fools of themselves to impress her. She tells the others that her name is \"Vonda McDrake\". She is thrown into Dimensional Limbo by [[Lord Dragaunus|Dragaunus]], who believes that she switched the item she was sent to steal from a tomb with the help from the Ducks; however, it had really been switched by [[Wildwing Flashblade|Wildwing]]. The end result is her being sent into Dimensional Limbo, and the weapon Dragaunus tries to use the chip for blowing up in his face.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nLucretia Decoy Close Up.jpg\nTraitoramongus (19).png\nTraitoramongus (24).png\nlucretiadefeat.png|Lucretia DeCoy's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:DeCoy, Lucretia}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
