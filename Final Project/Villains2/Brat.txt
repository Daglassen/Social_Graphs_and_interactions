He is voiced by [[Bill Scott]].\n==Personality==\nBrat sputters, babbles, and grunts in his speech, but Croc understands what he is saying. Like Croc, he is very lazy and has a strong dislike toward the Wuzzles coupled with a desire to have the best of what they have without applying any effort toward acquiring it. As his name implies, Brat is very bad-tempered and is often shown throwing tantrums when he does not get his own way. He is also greatly lacking in intelligence, and his incompetence often sees himself and Croc falling victim to their own devices, which in turn occasionally sees the two of them falling out.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBrat eats tire.jpg\nJabbering Brat.jpg\nbrat4.jpg\nBrat on the ground.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wuzzles}}\n[[Category:Wuzzles characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
