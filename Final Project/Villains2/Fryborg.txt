"[[File:Fryborg.png|thumb]]'''''Fryborg''''' is a giant robot from the five minute TV show, ''[[The Bite-Sized Adventures of Sam Sandwich]]''. He intends on making kids eat fried foods instead of eating healthy foods. He is voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz]].\n==History==\nFryborg, contrary to his name, appears to be entirely robotic. He speaks with a sterotypical robot voice and mannerisms, and is the largest of the antagonists. His arms can change into a number of things to commit crime and attack the goodies with. Fryborg, true to his name, likes dishing out deep fried foods. Both of Fryborg's appearances have him short-circuiting. Fryborg can also shapeshift into a truck. He appears to have missing teeth. These combined with his wide eyes, give him a dopey, non-threatening appearance.\n==Appearances==\n*''Lunch Truck Trick''\n*''Raining Fries''\n*''Sam's Secret Weapons''\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFryborg.png\nFryborg as a Helicopter.png\nFryborg as a Truck.png\nFryborg as a Truck 2.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Robots]]\n\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
