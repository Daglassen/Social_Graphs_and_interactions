She is an old flame of Jack Sparrow, as well as the daughter of the ruthless pirate [[Blackbeard]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nAngelica is an experienced pirate. She was a good sailor, tactician, and swordswoman. She is also a good liar (lying by telling the truth) and schemer, as being an expert in the art of deception. From her time at the convent she retained a strong faith; however, she applies her belief illogically.\n\nOne of Angelica's strongest motivations is to see her own father [[Blackbeard]] save his soul from damnation. But she does not succeed in making him behave in a fair, or kindly manner, and seems to be completely blind to the fact that Blackbeard is not interested in saving his soul, even after he attempts to sacrifice her life to save his own at the Fountain of Youth. Part of this blind devotion came from her desire for a real father figure.\n\nA master of disguises, Angelica learns the art of the con from the best, one Captain Jack Sparrow.<ref>http://movies.ign.com/articles/115/1155871p1.html</ref> She is defined as being a woman who often tells lies that are truths and truths that are lies. She is tricky and quick-witted, as befitting any pirate, although her sense of faith and disapproval of her father's methods imply a compassionate side. Angelica also has a sense of humor, which is demonstrated most ably in her spitfire banter with Jack Sparrow.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nAngelica is a slender woman with olive skin, long dark brown hair, brown eyes, and purple circles around her eyes. She dresses a black paisley vest with gold designs on it, a white off-the-shoulder peasant shirt with long sleeves, a busty black corset with a gold trim, and both matching pants and knee-high boots with heels. Angelica also wears a black belt with a gold designed buckle, a matching hat with band, thick gold square outlined buckle, and large fluffy beige feather on it, a silver ring, and gold cross necklace.\n\n==Role in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|film]]==\n{{Quote|Sparrow, ven aqui o te arranco la cabeza!|Angelica to [[Jack Sparrow]]}}\nAngelica, impersonating [[Jack Sparrow|Jack]], begins to recruit sailors for the [[Queen Anne's Revenge]]. Jack learns about it and goes to face the person who personifies him.\n\nAfter the battle with the false Jack Sparrow, where Jack discovers that it is Angelica, the woman of Seville through a sword move that she used. He pulls her in and kisses her, to her surprise before he greets her. Angelica realizes her identity has been exposed and she greets him before they talk and discuss the Fountain of Youth before they are told by Scrum guards are approaching.\n\nWhile waiting for the guards, she berates Jack for his ways and accuses of having seduced her when she met him just before she was to take a vow of celibacy in a Spanish convent. Angelica blames Jack of seducing her and for her corruption in becoming a pirate. Offended, Jack then deflects that back on her being a natural born liar which annoys her.\n\nAngelica and Jack join forces to defeat the guards, when the guards had cornered, she stabs a lever and saves them from being captured. While they talk, Jack learns from Angelica, that a mermaid was needed to perform the ritual at that moment one of the [[Blackbeard's Zombie Officers|Zombie Officers]] fires a voodoo dart to unconscious him. Angelica has Jack taken aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, to guide them to the [[Fountain of Youth]].\n\nAlready being aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge as First Mate of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', Angelica was grabbed by Jack and she calms him by claiming to be conning Blackbeard into being his daughter.\n\nShe had to stop a mutiny caused by Jack, the mutiny ended when Blackbeard awoke from his nap. Blackbeard was willing to kill Sparrow, but Angelica reminds him that he is needed. When Blackbeard learned that the cook was in charge of the vigilance ordered him to leave the ship in a boat, Angelica suspected what his father would do, then she begs her father not do it, her plea was ignored, and Blackbeard then orders his men to fire the Greek fire cannons. Later, Angelica saves Jack again when [[Blackbeard]] was torturing him with a voodoo doll.\n\nShe danced with Jack and told him of how to perform the ritual and what was needed from the [[Chalices of Cartagena]], which were inside the Ponce de Le\u00f3n's ship. She also promised to reward Jack and showed him her Blackbeard's collection of shrunken ships in his cabin, she knew the one he would choose the [[Black Pearl]]. She soon revealed to Jack that she truly is Blackbeard's child having lied to Jack by telling the truth, to which he is impressed. She told Jack of the prophecy of her father's death and how she sees good in her father, despite there being none.\n\nWhile Jack Sparrow led the group they encountered an obstacle, a broken bridge. Blackbeard told Jack to jump but Jack refused, then Blackbeard replied if he did not jump, he would kill Angelica. Jack thought it was not serious but to discover if it was true that decided to jump. After Jack jump, Angelica asked her father if he knew which guns were loaded, Blackbeard told her that he knew. That night, the crew found the pools of the jungle, Angelica knowing that [[Syrena]] and [[Philip Swift|Philip]] like each other devised a plan to get Syrena's tear, the plan was ultimately successful.\n\nAngelica and the crew wandering through the jungle until Jack appears with Gibbs, who had held a wild boar with the chalices. After obtaining the chalices, Jack requested two conditions to deliver the chalices, which Blackbeard accepted. After an arduous search, the crew arrives at the Fountain of Youth. However, Angelica realized they were not alone, in the thick fog Barbossa appears with his crew, this caused a battle between the two crews which lasted until the Spanish Armada arrived.\n\nAfter being surrounded by the Spanish, Angelica was forced to hand over the chalices to the Spaniard, then the Spaniard gave the order to his men to destroy the Fountain, while Blackbeard and the Spaniard were talking, Barbossa appears and stabs Blackbeard. Angelica comes to his aid but is poisoned by Barbossa's sword.\n\nWhen she is unintentionally poisoned by Barbossa's poison-laced sword while trying to remove it from her father's chest, Jack tricks Blackbeard into sacrificing his life to save Angelica's. As a result, despite the fact Blackbeard was intending to let her die so he would live, Angelica holds Jack responsible for her father's death and Jack maroons her on a deserted island where she tries to convince him not to before wasting the sole round from her pistol in an attempt to kill him. In a post-credits scene, Angelica finds Blackbeard's [[Jack Sparrow Voodoo Doll|voodoo doll]] made in Jack's image and takes delight that she may have her revenge yet.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n\n===[[Adventureland (Magic Kingdom)|Adventureland]]===\nAngelica appeared as a walkaround character at the [[Magic Kingdom]], roaming Adventureland in 2011 to promote the film and its since-removed integrations with the attraction.\n\n===[[World of Color]]===\nShe also appears in World of Color as part of the extended Pirates of the Caribbean sequence added for the summer of [[2011]] to promote ''On Stranger Tides''.
