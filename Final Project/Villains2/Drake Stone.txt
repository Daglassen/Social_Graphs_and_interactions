When he was fifteen years old and without a family his original master left him for unknown reasons, leaving him with a copy of the Encantus which was how he was able to learn sorcery and to be a famous magician with a lot of fame and fortune throughout his entire life in spite of his \"abandonment issues\".\n\n==Role in the film== \nDrake was recruited by [[Maxim Horvath]] to help him retrieve the Grimhold. They both succeed when Drake disguises himself as [[Dave Stutler]], attacked his mentor [[Balthazar Blake]] and retrieved the doll intact.\n\nBack at his penthouse building in [[Manhattan]], he was later betrayed by Horvath when he told him about the \"Parasite Spell\", a curse originated in Haiti and its purpose to transfer energy from one sorcerer to another. Horvath quickly used the spell on Drake and stole his ring, now imbued with Drake's magic and also his life energy, causing Drake's death.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the film, his character was based on real-life Criss Angel.\n* When he met Drake Stone for the first time, Dave wondered whether the latter was from Depeche Mode, alluding Drake's own appearance which reminiscent of early looks of Depeche Mode member Martin Gore.\n* Drake Stone's character was not conceived in the film's original script, let alone any evil sorcerer like him. Instead, a character named Menmet-Ra of Giza, an Egyptian evil sorcerer was developed in his place. Menmet-Ra fights Dave and Balthazar where the fight culminated to his death at hands of the older Merlinean.\n** Interestingly, as with Drake, Menmet-Ra revealed Dave's status as Prime Merlinean in their respective confrontation, leading the sorcerer-in-training to question the purpose of his training.\n** Also, the same script's description of Horvath's penthouse resemble those of Drake.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDrake Stone.jpg\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-4769.jpg\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-6056.jpg\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-6694.jpg\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-7875.jpg|The Disguise Spell (Transformation Spell) used by Drake Stone to deceive Balthazar.\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-8876.jpg\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-8911.jpg|Drake's magic and his life energy gets drained by Horvath, before the latter steals his ring.\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-8920.jpg|Drake's defeat.\nSorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-9249.jpg|Drake Stone for Magic: The Gathering.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:The Sorcerer's Apprentice characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]"
