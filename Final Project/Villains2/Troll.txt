He insults the guards and grows in size each time his victims talk back. As the Troll gets bigger and climbs further towards the food, more guards try unsuccessfully to defeat him.\n\nThe Troll finally reaches the dinner table and attempts to make fun of Wander. However, he simply ignored the insults and caused the Troll to shrink. Sylvia and the goats then realized how to take the Troll down.
