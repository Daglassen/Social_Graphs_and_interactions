He is only seen at the beginning, following the introduction of [[Ariel]].\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Little Mermaid]]''===\nGlut is first seen swimming around the sunken ship, where he finds [[Ariel]] and [[Flounder]] inside. He immediately attacks the duo and begins a chase, but ends up getting his head stuck in the ring of an anchor. He isn't seen again in the rest of the film.\n\nIn an original draft for the movie, Glut managed to escape from his predicament and would fight Ariel and Flounder again while they are chasing the wedding ship to stop [[Prince Eric|Eric]] and \"Vanessa\"'s wedding. Flounder musters up the strength and courage to trick Glut into getting Ariel close enough to the ship for her to get up onto it and then he manages to bite the barrel she was on (which is later revealed to be a gunpowder keg) as Flounder manages to escape from the results. It is implied that Glut was killed in the ensuing explosion.\n\n===[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|''The Little Mermaid'' (TV series)]]===\nGlut appears in ''The Little Mermaid'' television series occasionally. Several great white sharks that resemble him appear as well.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]''===\nGlut is a minor character in ''Kingdom Hearts'' in Atlantica. He mainly appears around the Sunken Ship and attacks Sora and company while they are there. When the friends are searching for Ursula's lair, he attacks in an attempt to eat them. Upon being defeated, he flees. However, he still remains around the Sunken Ship after Ursula's defeat. [[Sora]] is able to battle him because if he goes into the area, he will attack.\n\n===Other games===\nGlut appears as a boss fight for the video game spin-offs ''[[The Little Mermaid (video game)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Ariel: The Little Mermaid]]''\n\nIn ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'', [[Mizrabel]] uses an illusion of Glut in her army of minions.\n\nGlut also appears as a boss in ''[[World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck]]''.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===''[[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]''===\nGlut is possibly revived and is now a pet/minion of Ursula. When the park guests must stop her from flooding [[Cinderella Castle]], she summons him to devour her foes. Fortunately, they are able to defeat and chain him up with magic. The dark magic Glut left behind allowed the guests and [[Sebastian]] to track down Ursula.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite sharks and other fish not having vocal cords and as such not being able to produce any sounds, Glut is clearly heard growling, snarling, and even roaring in his scenes. However, this may have been added for dramatic effect. His growling noises were provided by [[Frank Welker]]. This may also be a possible reference to the infamous roaring shark of ''Jaws: The Revenge''.\n*His death in the deleted scene may have been a reference to the climax of the original ''Jaws'' film.\n*Glut may be the inspiration for [[Undertow]] from the sequel, as they have some similarities in common; for example; both of them are villainous sharks. However, Undertow can talk, while Glut does not talk.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\ntlmpe135.jpg\ntlmpe136.jpg\nlittle-mermaid-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-836.jpg\ntlmpe137.jpg\ntlmpe138.jpg\nlittle-mermaid-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-845.jpg\nGlut Attacks.jpg\ntlmpe141.jpg\nGlut defeat.jpg|Glut's defeat\ntlmpe149.jpg\ndoublebubble77.jpg\ndoublebubble78.jpg\nCaptainDonald3.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGlut the Sharkepic-mickey-power-of-illusion.png|Glut the Shark in ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]''\nShark kh.jpg|Glut in ''Kingdom Hearts''\nKH Glut 2.png\nMcDonalds  Glut Shark Toy.JPG|McDonalds  Glut Shark Toy\nDisney pins- Glut the shark.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sharks]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts Bosses]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
