He appears as the main antagonist of the first season of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)| Daredevil]]'', and a supporting antagonist of the second and third seasons. A ruthless and powerful crimelord, Kingpin's goal is to tear the economy of his hometown Hell's Kitchen apart so that he may rebuild it better, free of pain and crime. However, his seemingly noble agendas eventually give way to simple power-craving and manipulation. He is commonly seen as a recurring foe of [[Spider-Man]] and the archnemesis of [[Daredevil]].\n\nKingpin was created by [[Stan Lee]] and John Romita, Sr.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]''===\nWilson Fisk attempts to take over Hell's Kitchen while maintaining a presentable image to the public while (unlike his traditional depictions) greatly lacks self-confidence, is emotionally unstable, and initially does not adopt the Kingpin moniker. A large focus of his story in season one is his budding relationship with Vanessa Mariana (which results in an eventual proposal) while him and his right-hand man have dealings with criminals, politicians and police officers on his side. Eventually, Fisk is legally detained thanks to Matt Murdock's work where the FBI has rounded up those involved with his plot. Fisk is then beaten in combat by Daredevil before being incarcerated. In season two, Fisk uses Frank Castle as a pawn to dispose an underground drug ring so the Punisher could dispose of any rival gangsters, and uses a major lawyer as a consigliere. In season three, the Kingpin is released from prison via a deal to be a criminal informant for the FBI. With the help of his fixer Felix Manning, he manipulates his own FBI protection detail, such as Ray Nadeem and Dex Poindexter, using the latter to frame Daredevil as a criminal to the public.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kingpin was played by the late [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] in the 2003 film ''Daredevil''.\n*Kingpin first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''\u00a0#50 (July [[1967]]) originally as a regular of [[Spider-Man]]'s rogue's gallery. In the comics he has respect for Daredevil and despises Spider-Man with a passion due to the latter's fat jokes, his witty banter, his taunts, and his immaturity, only respecting the wall-crawler's scientific interest and knowledge.\n*\"[[Revelations (Daredevil)|Revelations]]\" is the first episode of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', in which Fisk is referred to as Kingpin, his [[Marvel Comics|comic book]] alias.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDaredevil Poster 01.png\nDaredevil Character Poster Banner.jpg\nDaredevil - 1x03 - Rabbit in a Snowstorm - Photography - Kingpin Back.jpg\nDaredevil - 1x13 - Daredevil - Photography - Wilson Fisk.jpg\nDaredevil - 1x04 In the Blood - Photography - Kingpin.jpg \nDaredevil - 2x02 - Please - Photography - Fisk.jpg\nDaredevil - 3x04 - Blindsided - Photography - Fisk and Poindexter.jpg\nDaredevil - 3x05 - The Perfect Game - Photography - Fisk.jpg\nDaredevil - 3x07 - Aftermath - Photography - Kingpin.jpg\nDaredevil - 3x07 - Aftermath - Photography - Kingpin Wadrobe.jpg\nDaredevil - 3x08 - Upstairs Downstairs - Photography - Karen and Fisk.jpg\nDaredevil - 3x08 - Upstairs Downstairs - Photography - FBI, Karen and Fisk.jpg\nDaredevil - 3x09 - Revelations - Photography - Kingpin.jpg\nDaredevil - 1x13 - Daredevil - Daredevil Vs.
