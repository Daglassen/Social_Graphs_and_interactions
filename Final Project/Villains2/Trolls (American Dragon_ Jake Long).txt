They live in sewers or under\u00a0bridges. They can also have a single eye, like [[Stan Lipkowski]]. Some can be good and some can be evil.\n\nTroll belches are often used for ingredients to create potions such as \"shapeshifting potions\" and \"portal potions\".\n\n==History==\n\nJake stopped two trolls that tried to attack a Leprechaun (turns out that they wanted their gold back). Jake hired them to stop the Huntsclan to get one of the Aztec Skulls and he repays them a bag full of a lot of Leprechaun gold and two golden motorcycles.\n\n==Magical powers==\n\nTheir fur can turn into monstrous hairball when burned by the fire or the sun. Also, Trolls themselves turn to stone when the sun hits them.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The Troll that the [[Kelpie]] transforms into\u00a0was also seen in \"[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]\".\n*In \"[[Shapeshifter]]\", Troll Belches are slimy and the belches can be heard, but in \"[[Half Baked|Half-Baked]]\", it is totally invisible and only the noise can be heard.\n*In \"[[Keeping Shop]]\",\u00a0it has been shown that Trolls get angry at anyone who insults their mama.\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Trolls]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
