At the beginning of the short, their father is shown educating them on the different food products that can be made out of pigs. Not unlike [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], the three wolves are somewhat rebellious, as they slingshot Big Bad when his back is turned. They assist their father in his plan to capture Fiddler and Fifer, where he disguises himself as [[Little Bo Peep]] and they dress as her sheep to lure the two gullible pigs to their den. Once in the den, the Three Little Wolves ambush the two pigs, with one wolf chasing Fifer with an axe and the other two Wolves fighting over Fiddler. As Big Bad prepares to cook the pigs, one of the Little Wolves takes the wolf alarm horn that Fifer had brought along and starts playing with it. The pigs tease the little wolf about his horn-blowing until Big Bad takes the horn himself and blows it hard enough to catch Practical's attention. Practical manages to lure Big Bad into his recently-complete Wolf Pacifier machine, which eventually blasts the Wolf into the sky. The Little Wolves see their dad getting launched into the sky and run off to catch him.\n\n[[File:28610.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Three Little Wolves plot to eat Fiddler and Fifer behind their father's back.]]\nThe Little Wolves appeared again in ''[[The Practical Pig]]'', once again eager to eat Fiddler and Fifer after their father successfully captures them. This time, however, Big Bad Wolf resolves that they will ''not'' eat them until after he has also captured Practical. The Little Wolves' sneaky rebelliousness from the previous short is shown off even more here, as they disobey their father's orders and try to eat Fiddler and Fifer early anyway. However, right before they can cook the two pigs as a big pie, they remember that they forgot to add pepper to it. One of them shakes too much pepper over the pigs' noses, causing them to sneeze the pie dough off and onto the Wolves, getting them stuck on the wall and allowing the pigs to escape.\n\n===Other appearances===\nTwo of them made a cameo appearance in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' being chased by Practical Pig. All three of them appear in the [[Roger Rabbit]] cartoon, ''[[Tummy Trouble]]'' on a picture in the doctor's office. They also make a cameo in \"[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]\" short \"[[Carried Away (Mickey Mouse)|Carried Away]]\".\n\n===''[[The Stories and Songs of Walt Disney's Three Little Pigs]]''===\nThe two animated shorts featuring the Three Little Wolves were later adapted, along with the original ''[[The Three Little Pigs|Three Little Pigs]]'' short, on a vinyl record album in 1967. Their portrayal on the album differs quite a bit from the shorts, possibly as a result of the creation of [[Li'l Wolf]] in the comic books. Unlike the cartoons, the album refers to the Three Little Wolves (or at least two of them) as the Big Bad Wolf's nephews instead of his sons. Also, one of them is depicted as being just like (or is actually supposed to be) Li'l Wolf, to the point that he helps Fiddler and Fifer escape at the end of ''The Practical Pig'' segment.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Three Little Wolves appear in''House of Mouse'' episode \"[[Pete's House of Villains]]\". When Pete takes control of the [[House of Mouse (night club)|club]] and puts his fellow [[Disney Villains]] in charge of all the crew positions, the Three Little Wolves had a cameo, replacing [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] as the house band. Interestingly, that episode also featured a new cartoon short starring Li'l Wolf; therefore, it is unclear if, in the context of ''House of Mouse'', the Three Little Wolves are still considered Big Bad Wolf's sons or if they are his nephews as stated in the above-mentioned album.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\n28613.jpg\n28609.jpg\n28608.jpg\nWalt+Disney+-+The+Stories+And+Songs+Of+Walt+Disney's+Three+Little+Pigs+-+LP+RECORD-287158.jpg|The Three Little Wolves (or rather, two of them and [[Li'l Bad Wolf|Li'l Wolf]]) on the cover of the vinyl adaptation\nTresLobitos HouseOfMouse.png|The Three Little Wolves in The ''House of Mouse'' episode \"[[Pete's House of Villains]]\"\nTHREE LITTLE WOLVES.png\n1936 DISNEY 2.png\n1936 DISNEY.png\nmickey-wolves.jpg|Cameo in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''\n025-015wolfpie.jpg\nlw.png\n025-014porkpie.jpg\nPractpigms385.jpg\nTumblr mvbeu9DL9e1r2w8eqo1 1280.jpg\nThree Wolves.jpg|Cameo in ''[[Tummy Trouble]]''\nCarriedAway2.jpeg|Cameo in \"[[Carried Away (Mickey Mouse)|Carried Away]]\"\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Li'l Bad Wolf]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
