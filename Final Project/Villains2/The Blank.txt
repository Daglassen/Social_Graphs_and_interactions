He\u00a0is much\u00a0like the Question and the Terrible Trivium from the Phantom Tollbooth. After he causes the murder of a corrupt political official who was conspiring with [[Big Boy Caprice]], this causes alarm among Big Boy, who shouts at his underlings that he now has two threats against him, and that he \"wants [[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]] dead and he wants this no-face dead\".\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTheblank3.jpg\nSCVIEW407528.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blank, The}}\n\n{{Dick Tracy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dick Tracy characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
