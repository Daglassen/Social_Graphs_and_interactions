Sadly for Scrooge, she only wants to marry him for his money. She has an evil side to her that shows when she has plans to deliberately destroy everything which is precious to the household. First, she will send [[Webby]] to finish school and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews]] to the military. Second, she will fire [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] and [[Duckworth]]. After that, she will be completely in charge of Scrooge's money and household.\n\nAfter Scrooge finds out she only wants to marry him for his money and [[Glittering Goldie|Goldie]] shows up to stop their wedding, she tries to marry [[Flintheart Glomgold|Glomgold]] instead. Glomgold's answer to this is to run for his life.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Millionara Vanderbucks is the possible inspiration to Velma Vanderduck, a female business rival of Scrooge's in the the ''Uncle Scrooge'' comics. They have similar names and hairstyles and they serve as female duck antagonists to both Scrooge and Glomgold.\n*Millionara Vanderbucks bares a resemblance to the Duchess/Featherika Von Strangeduck from [[Hotel Strangeduck]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTillnephewsdouspart.jpg|Millionara with [[Scrooge McDuck]].\nmillionara_vanderbucks 1.jpg|Millionara Vanderbucks introduces herself to Scrooge.\nmillionara_vanderbucks 2.jpg\nep08_A03.jpg\nmillionera2.jpg\nmillionara_vanderbucks 3.jpg|Scrooge proposes to Millionara.\nep08_A07.jpg\nep08_A08.jpg\nmillionara_vanderbucks 4.jpg\nep08_A11.jpg\nep08_3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vanderbucks, Millionara}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
