Ice Wizzrobes are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Four Swords ===
Ice Wizzrobes appear inside Vaati's Palace in Four Swords. They will vanish and appear in a random location and attack with a ball of ice before vanishing again. 


=== The Minish Cap ===

Ice Wizzrobes appear as an ice variant to the standard green Wizzrobes and Fire Wizzrobes in The Minish Cap. Like the others, they will teleport to random locations throughout the area in which they appear, shooting their ice attack before vanishing again.


=== A Link Between Worlds ===
Ice Wizzrobes appear alongside their Fire Wizzrobe variants in A Link Between Worlds. Like previous incarnations, they will randomly appear around the area and attack with a ball of ice before vanishing again.


=== Tri Force Heroes ===
Ice Wizzrobes appear alongside dark Wizzrobes in Tri Force Heroes. They are common in the Ice Cavern, but also appear in the Sky Temple. The ice beams they cast can freeze the Links on contact. They float at varying heights; those that float high above the ground can be reached by forming a Totem. They require at least two Sword strikes to defeat. As ice-based enemies, they are also weak to fire, and can be defeated by a single fireball either thrown or held with the Fire Gloves.


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Ice Wizzrobes can be found near ruins around the Gerudo Highlands and Hyrule Field regions in Breath of the Wild. They attack by using their Ice Rods to summon blasts of cold air or by summoning frozen monsters such as Ice Chuchus and Ice Keese. They also create blizzards to decrease the area's temperature, making it too cold for Link without cold-resistant Armor or Elixirs. Ice Wizzrobes, like their variants, will turn invisible after attacking, leaving ripples in the air with each footstep. Striking one in the head with an Arrow will stun it and give Link time to attack. Hitting it with a fire-based attack, such as with a Fire Arrow or a Flameblade, will immediately evaporate it. When defeated, Ice Wizzrobes drop their Ice Rods.
