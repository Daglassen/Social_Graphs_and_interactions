They are high ranking students at the L.I.V.E. Institute that cause trouble for the Mysterious Benedict Society.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nJackson and Jillson are very soft-spoken and socially polite, but hide an almost passive-aggressive nature underneath. They are very off-putting and while they enjoy their work, also enjoy seeing those beneath them getting their, believed to be, deserved punishment. They are very strict and loyal to the rules they have been given, until they do not need to follow them exactly. While they claim they are looking out for the betterment of the students, it is quite obvious that they simply enjoy the superiority they hold.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nJackson and Jillson are both rather attractive students. They are both tall and slender and have dark hair with Jackson's hair longish and curly and Jillson's hair straight and pulled back. They both wear blue shirts with yellow collars and dress pants and soft shoes.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original book series, Jackson and Jillson were much more cruel and hate-filled. Their appearances are also radically different with Jillson described as \"a powerfully built woman, with a greasy brown ponytail and small, piggish eyes of an indeterminate color\" and \"arms like jackhammers\", while Jackson is described as \"a stocky, red-headed boy with icy blue eyes and a nose so skinny and sharp it resembled a knife\".\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:Jackson|Jackson]] at [[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:The_Mysterious_Benedict_Society_Wiki|The Mysterious Benedict Society Wiki]]\n*[[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:Jillson|Jillson]] at [[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:The_Mysterious_Benedict_Society_Wiki|The Mysterious Benedict Society Wiki]]\n{{The Mysterious Benedict Society}}\n[[Category:The Mysterious Benedict Society]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
