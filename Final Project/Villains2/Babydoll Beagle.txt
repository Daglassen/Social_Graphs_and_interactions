She appears in the ''DuckTales'' episode \"[[The Good Muddahs]]\" together with her sisters [[Boom-Boom Beagle]] [382-238] and [[Bouffant Beagle]] [767-171].\n\n==Personality==\nBabydoll is the most tomboyish of the Beagle Babes. She's somewhat rough, impulsive and impatient. If Bouffant doesn't come up with a plan, Babydoll will usually think of one on the spot herself. These vary in success. While the Beagle Babes are thieves, they don't seem to be very evil in nature. Bouffant and her sisters really started to care about [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] after they kidnap her.\n\n==Appearances==\nBabydoll Beagle and her sisters [[Bouffant Beagle]] and [[Boom-Boom Beagle]] appear in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[The Good Muddahs]]\", in which she and her sisters kidnap [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] and hold her for ransom.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Babydoll may be 18 years old, but it isn't mentioned.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBeagleBabes TGM2.png\n136784252131.jpg\n180424.jpg\nTheBeagleBabes.jpg\nBabydoll Beagle.jpg\nBabydoll Beagle took Webby Duck.jpg\nBabydollWebby_1.png|Babydoll listening to Webby telling a story.\nBeagleBabes TGM.png\nBBabes 3.png\nBeagleBabes_TGM4.png|The Beagle Babes crying.\nBabydoll Beagle Cry.jpg|Babydoll Beagle with tears in her eyes.\nBBabes 5.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beagle, Babydoll}}\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
