He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n\n==Background==\nLilliput worked at the miniature golf course, \"Goony Golf\", and was using a strange hat to communicate with and control ants. With his tiny minions, and his trusty shrink ray, he began turning [[St. Canard]]'s monuments into miniature props for his golf course. This is essentially his modus operandi, as well as collecting some cash along the way. He is defeated when he shrinks [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing]] down to the size of the germ, and the caped crusader \"infects\" him.\n\nApparently, symptoms of Darkwing-itis involve one's face turning green and spotted, and is accompanied by uncontrollable sneezing. See your local doctor immediately, if symptoms worsen into a pervasive urge to wear a cape and speak in obsessive alliteration.\n\nLilliput appears in the episode \"[[Getting Antsy]]\", and makes a cameo with the villains who stole the [[S.H.U.S.H.]] Agency List in \"In Like Blunt\". He later appeared as a member of the League of Barely-Remembered Supervillains in the revival comics.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n07-110.jpg\nDarkwing-duck-15-league-of-barely-remembered-supervillains.jpg\n475530-vlcsnap_01281.jpg\n475532-vlcsnap_01292.jpg\n475534-vlcsnap_01297.jpg\n475535-vlcsnap_01301.jpg\n475542-vlcsnap_01337.jpg\n475544-vlcsnap_01342.jpg\n475582-vlcsnap_01537.jpg\n475583-vlcsnap_01546.jpg\n475584-vlcsnap_01558.jpg\n475585-vlcsnap_01560.jpg\n475591-vlcsnap_01580.jpg\n475596-vlcsnap_01602.jpg\n475602-vlcsnap_01631.jpg\n475603-vlcsnap_01635.jpg|Lilliput under the effects of Darkwing-itis.\n475605-vlcsnap_01647.jpg\nDarkwing-duck-omnibus-silvani-fa9c0.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\nHis defeat in ''Let's Get Antsy'' is similar to [[Madame Mim]]'s. For after a battle with the hero, the hero is turned into a germ who infects him.\n\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lilliput (Darkwing Duck)}}\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
