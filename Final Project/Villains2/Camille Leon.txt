She can change the style and color of her hair, skin, and facial and body structures to look like others, framing them and able to steal valuables without detection.\n\n===Weaknesses===\n*'''Clothes:''' Camille can change her appearance, but her clothes remain the same when changing form.\n*'''Appearance Identification:''' If Camille takes the form of someone who people already knew or saw before, she'll draw suspicion. Wade gave a video of Nikki in the pool with Camille taking her form with her expensive cellphone.\n*'''Memory:''' Camille doesn't know about the people whose form she takes.\n\n==History==\nCamille is a beautiful actress and a former heiress of a cat food fortune, who for reasons unknown was disinherited by her parents. She underwent an experimental plastic surgery procedure that granted her shape-shifting powers, which she used to frame others for her crimes. She has a small hairless cat named Debutante that she always carries around with her. She was first encountered during \"[[Trading Faces]]\" when she went on a crime spree in which she disguised herself as other celebrities and leaving the real celebrities with the blame. During which time she successfully managed to avoid detection by [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]], who slowly began to suspect her, but not [[Jim & Tim Possible|her brothers]], who successfully unmasked her as the culprit.\n\nCamille returned in the episode \"[[Fashion Victim (Kim Possible)|Fashion Victim]]\". Now having taken a more mercenary approach to her criminal lifestyle, Camille is hired by the Fashionistas to steal the newest fashion designs from Club Banana. Realizing that Kim also works at Club Banana, Camille also attempts to get back at her by shapeshifting into her and framing her for the design thefts. However, that turned out to be a failure, leaving the [[Fashionistas]] ruined and Camille arrested again.\n\nHer final speaking appearance is in the 11-minute short \"[[Chasing Rufus]]\", where she is once again making money at someone else's expense by disguising herself as Nikki Nikolas, a Greek shipping heiress. Camille escapes when Kim attempts to catch her, but ends up leaving her cat Debutante behind in the process, while Kim and Ron end up doing the same with Rufus. As Debutante tries to get back to her, poor Camille is stricken with loneliness, which she attempts to alleviate with shopping. Ultimately, when the two pets reach Go City attempt to mail themselves back to their respective owners only to be accidentally mixed up, causing Camille to scream at the sight of Rufus, alerting Kim and Ron, who were lunching at [[Bueno Nacho]].\n\nShe has a non-speaking cameo in the second part of \"[[Graduation]]\", where she is briefly seen (but with no close up) during [[Dr. Drakken|Drakken]]'s award ceremony. She also appears in the ending tag at the Caf\u00e9, where she is seen surprising [[Se\u00f1or Senior, Junior|Se\u00f1or Senior, Jr.]], by posing as [[Bonnie Rockwaller]], his current girlfriend.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is a pun on the word \"Chameleon\", which changes color to blend into its surroundings, like she uses her shape-sifting powers to blend in around other people.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nCamille Leon 2.jpg\nCamille KimRon.png\n20170807 182830.png\nMistress of disguise.jpeg\nTrading Faces (8).png\nTrading Faces (12).png\nFashion Victim (6).png\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Camille Chameleon]]\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leon, Camille}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
