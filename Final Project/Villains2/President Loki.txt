What did you expect?|Loki to [[Boastful Loki]]|Journey into Mystery}}\n\n'''President Loki''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]] that appears in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''. He is a [[Variants|Variant]] of [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] that became president but, under unknown circumstances, he was captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] and sent to [[the Void]]. There, he is followed by other Lokis, leading an army composed of his own Variants.\n\n==Background==\n===Biography===\nPresident Loki is a Loki from an alternate timeline. He did something that created a nexus event which caused the Sacred Timeline to branch, so he was captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] and his timeline was destroyed. He was then judged for his crimes against the Sacred Timeline and pruned, being sent to [[the Void]]. At some point during his life, he also became president. In the Void, he gained followers, creating an army of Loki Variants.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''====\nPresident Loki appears in the [[Journey into Mystery|fifth episode]], when the [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Variant of Loki]], who is accompanied by [[Kid Loki]], [[Alligator Loki]], [[Boastful Loki]] and [[Classic Loki]], decides to leave their hideout, the Loki Palace, to return to the TVA to find [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]], a woman Loki [[Variants|Variant]]. As Loki attempts to leave he meets President Loki and his army of Loki Variants at the entrance. Then, President Loki and all the Loki Variants accompanying him, invade the Loki Palace with the intention to overthrow Kid Loki who is the King of [[the Void]].\n\n{{Dialogue2|Boastful Loki|That was not the bargain! I gave you our location. In exchange for shelter and supplies, you give me your army and I take the throne.|President Loki|Ah, yes. Not so good a bargain. How about this one? My army, my throne?|attr=[[Boastful Loki]] and President Loki|src=Journey into Mystery}}\n\nClassic Loki accuses Loki of leading the enemy to them, but Boastful Loki then reveals that he was the one who betrayed them and informed their location to President Loki. Boastful Loki and President Loki had made a deal, in which Boastful Loki would allow him to have shelter and supplies by revealing their location and, in return, President Loki would let him take the throne and give him the army of Loki Variants. However, as soon as Boastful Loki tells the others that he is the traitor and points his hammer to Kid Loki, taking him as a hostage, President Loki breaks their deal. President Loki refuses to let Boastful Loki have the throne and the army, stating that both are his. But then President Loki is surprised by his own followers that turn their weapons to him, betraying him as they also want to take the throne. \n\nPresident Loki then notices Alligator Loki that is growling at him. Infuriated, he asks why there is an alligator there. Kid Loki and Classic Loki reply that the alligator is a Loki Variant too while Alligator Loki attacks President Loki, biting off his hand. Horrified after losing a hand, President Loki screams and the other Lokis start a battle inside the Loki Palace. President Loki is last seen fighting another Loki Variant that throws him inside a popcorn cart, while Classic Loki casts illusions that allow him, Loki, Alligator Loki and Kid Loki to escape from the hideout safely.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the film ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]'', [[Tom Hiddleston]] voiced young [[Captain Hook]], who is a character that also loses his hand, but to a [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]] instead of an alligator.\n*President Loki's appearance is based off of the 2016 comic ''Vote Loki'', where Loki ran a campaign to become the President of the United States.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nLoki - President Loki.jpg\nLoki Variants promo.jpg\nLoki Variants promo image.png\nLoki - 1x05 - Journey into Mystery - Photography - President Loki.jpg\nPresident Loki Concept Art.png\nLokis - Journey into Mystery - Behind the Scenes.png\nMany Lokis - Journey into Mystery - Behind the Scenes.png\nLoki - 1x05 - Journey into Mystery - President Loki with other Lokis.jpg\nLoki - 1x05 - Journey into Mystery - President Loki.jpeg\nPresident Loki vs. Lokis - Loki EP5.jpg\nPresident Loki is betrayed - Loki EP5.png\nAlligator Loki bites President Loki - Loki EP5.png\nPresident Loki screaming - Loki EP5.png\nPresident Loki POP.jpg\nLoki Cosbaby Bobble-Heads - President Loki.jpg\nNendoroid President Loki.jpg\nNendoroid President Loki with Miss Minutes.jpg\nPresident Loki Pins.png\nThe Trickster Tarot T-Shirt.jpg\nPruned Variants socks.png\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Loki Laufeyson]]\n*[[Sylvie Laufeydottir]]\n*[[Kid Loki]]\n*[[Alligator Loki]]\n*[[Classic Loki]]\n*[[Boastful Loki]]\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Norse Mythology]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Asgardians]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Loki characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Timeline Versions]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Avengers Campus characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
