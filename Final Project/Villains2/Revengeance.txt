Revengeance controlled the staff to turn on Mighty Med's positronic reactor to make himself human again. Revengeance gathered all nine Mighty Administrators, and set them in a specific formation to activate the access code for the reactor. Before Revengeance returned to his physical form,\u00a0Alan,\u00a0Oliver\u00a0and\u00a0Kaz\u00a0used a vacuum to suck Revengeance up, and powered it with\u00a0Surge's electric manipulation, thus defeating him.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Mighty Med characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
