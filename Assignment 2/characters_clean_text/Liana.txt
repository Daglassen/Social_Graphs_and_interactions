Liana is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Liana is a Gerudo soldier who can be found in the barracks in Gerudo Town. She trains some of the other soldiers. If Link speaks to her, she asks what an outsider is doing in the barracks and tells him that they are on high alert. If Link asks what happened, Liana begins to explain but quickly realizes that she should not tell an outsider anything involving their security. She mentions that she could tell him if he had permission from Captain Teake.
If Link speaks to Liana or Leena after speaking to Riju for the first time, Liana asks where Barta is. Leena explains that she went to the Yiga Clan Hideout two days ago and wonders what happened to her. Angered, Liana asks why she let Barta go by herself and Leena apologizes. Liana is upset that they now have to retrieve both the Thunder Helm and Barta. She expresses concern about Captain Teake finding out about it and Kotta asks what they should do, causing Liana to yell that she is thinking about it.
If Link talks to Liana after calming the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, she admits that she dismissed Link's abilities too quickly.
