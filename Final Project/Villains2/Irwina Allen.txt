But even though everyone wants her knowledge of insects, she always wants to be a star of rock and roll. Her boss, Mr. Sneed, is not too pleased about Irwina indulging in her dreams on company time. Irwina uses a sound device to hypnotize a swarm of bees under the leadership of [[Queenie]] to steal a bunch of instruments for a rock and roll gig. She plots to upstage [[Chip and Dale|Dale]]'s favorite rock and roll band, Iron Goose, and take their place on stage at the rock concert. Unfortunately during her concert, the Rescue Rangers destroy the device planted in her headgear, freeing the bees who then turn on the rock-crazy scientist and chase her off-stage.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nRisky_Beesness_14.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-09h37m25s752.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-09-09h37m54s113.png|Irwina is confronted by her boss, Mr. Sneed.\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-09h42m53s831.png|Irwina with her mind control device.\nVlcsnap-2015-08-09-09h41m43s536.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-09-09h43m31s122.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-08-08h31m51s741.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-08-08h31m58s358.png\nRisky_Beesness_15.jpg\nChip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 109 Risky Beesness arsenaloyal - YouTube13.jpg|Allen in her rock 'n roll bee suit.\nvlcsnap-2015-08-09-09h35m57s887.png\nYou'rethebestbee.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-08-08-08h29m25s886.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-08-08h26m32s869.png\nChip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 109 Risky Beesness arsenaloyal - YouTube14.jpg|Allen's defeat.\nvlcsnap-2015-08-08-08h26m19s440.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-08-08h27m03s018.png|The swarm chases Allen off stage.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Allen, Irwina}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
