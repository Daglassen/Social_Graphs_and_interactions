He can be found inside the lodge admiring a painting displayed on its wall, which depicts the Stable in [[Trilby Valley]]. Mayro comments that the painting was painted by the Stable owner [[Ozunda]], and is so captivated by its composition that he cannot stop looking at it.<ref>{{Cite|Have you come to look at this picture too? It's so beautiful... I could spend hours just looking at it. This painting was made by Ozunda, the owner of this stable, or so I hear. That volcano in the background... It's so majestic. And the stable is subtle in the scenery.|Mayro|BotW}}</ref> He adds that the Stable in the painting appears to be depicted from a southern direction.<ref>{{Cite|I think the {{Color|BotW Red|stable was painted from a southern direction}}... The composition is just so impressive...|Mayro|BotW}}</ref> Speaking to him initiates the \"[[A Landscape of a Stable]]\" [[Shrine Quest]], in which the painting provides a clue to finding the [[Tah Muhl Shrine]].\n\nAfter Link finds the Tah Muhl Shrine, Mayro realizes that there is an [[Ancient Shrine]] on the painting's left-hand side. He finds it unusual that a Shrine would be there, and questions who would even go to find it.<ref>{{Cite|Oh... There's a shrine on the left-hand side of the picture... I never noticed that shrine before. I've looked at this painting so much, and I never noticed it... Must be because that's an odd place for a shrine to be located. Who would go to a shrine there, anyway?|Mayro|BotW}}</ref> He is then surprised to hear that Link has already visited it, and admits that there are people determined enough to explore every bit of the world.<ref>{{Cite|Wait, what? You went there? I guess for some people, there's nothing to stop them from traveling the world.|Mayro|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
