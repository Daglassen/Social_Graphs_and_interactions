When Paya notices [[Link]] she jumps up with an exclamation and hides her face throughout the conversation.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|A man?!}}|Paya|BotW}}</ref> She spots the [[Sheikah Slate]] on Link's hip and wonders if he is the hero her grandmother spoke about and tries to remember his name.<ref>{{Cite|Huh? Is that-?! It's...a {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Slate}}! Could you be the hero my grandmother told me about? What was his name? Li... Lin... Ummm...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> The [[Sheikah]] says she is bad at speaking and stutters before finally stating her name.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, it's not that I forgot...I'm just bad with speaking. As for me, my name is Pa... Paaa... Paaay... Oh! My name is Paya! Phew! I got it out...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Once she says her name, Paya is able to calm down enough to take her hands from her face. She knows it should be easy to say her own name and apologizes.<ref>{{Cite|I know I should be able to say that easily, seeing as how it's my own name and all. I'm so...sorry.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Since Impa has been waiting for the hero's return since Paya was little, she urges Link to go inside and see her grandmother.<ref>{{Cite|Anyway, my grandmother's been awaiting your return ever since I was little. Plea...please hurry inside.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> If Link should come closer, Paya will panic and hide in her hands again, mentioning how close he is before asking that he go inside.<ref>{{Cite|AHHHH! Master...Master Link! You...you're very close to me right now! I just... My...my grandmother is waiting for you at her abode. Please hurry to her!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> She will remain outside until Link and her grandmother have finished their conversation to give them some privacy. Once they are finished, she comes back in to go to the [[Sheikah Heirloom]], mentioning how she needs to look after it.<ref>{{Cite|I must protect the heirloom...|Paya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt first, Paya is still incredibly shy around Link and refers to him with a title.<ref>{{Cite|M-Master Link!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Still, she is incredibly eager to help him in any way she can.<ref>{{Cite|Is anything the matter? Anything at all? Can I help you in any way?!|Paya|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Please don't hesitate to let me know if I can ever be of service!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Link can ask her about the artifact she is cleaning and she will tell him everything she knows,<ref>{{Cite|[What's that ball?] This... This priceless artifact here? Is that what you want to know about? This is a {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah heirloom}} that we have long protected.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> bringing up a saying that was passed down through generations.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Red|\"The hero, as chosen by the Sheikah heirloom, will be gifted the blessing of antiquity.\"}} With these words as our guide, we have watched over this sacred artifact since my grandmother's grandmother's time... And even since HER grandmother's grandmother's time before that!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Paya admits that she does not know the meaning of the words, but continues to contemplate it.<ref>{{Cite|I cannot say that I entirely know the meaning of these words. But now that I think about it... \"{{Color|BotW Red|The hero, as chosen by the Sheikah heirloom}}...\" Could it be...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> If asked about the Village, Paya will speak about the Sheikah tribe itself,<ref>{{Cite|[This village?] We Sheikah have long served the royal family of Hyrule in secret. During the {{Color|BotW Red|Great Calamity}} of 100 years ago...the royal family was destroyed, and the members of our tribe scattered.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> as well as how the Yiga Clan began.<ref>{{Cite|Sadly, there were some who swore allegiance to {{Color|BotW Red|Ganon}} at that time. They joined together as the Yiga Clan, seeking out all who opposed {{Color|BotW Red|Ganon}}...cutting them down, one after another.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> She warns Link that the Yiga Clan is likely to come after him,<ref>{{Cite|Master Link, now that you are awake, you are surely the most formidable opponent standing against them! No doubt they will come for you, employing whatever underhanded methods they can devise...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> but quickly asks that he let her know if she can help.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, but of course, if there's anything I can do to help you, all you have to do is ask!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Impa speaks up, mentioning the [[Great Fairy Fountain]] hiding above the Village.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Red|The Great Fairy Cotera}}... Only a few remain who know this, but this village was built under her watchful eye.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Paya tells Link where he can find the Fountain in the hopes that she will aid him.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Blue|The Great Fairy}} resides {{Color|BotW Red|behind the shrine that overlooks this village}}. That is where you should seek her. You can put you trust in the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Fairy}}. I can't think of a reason she wouldn't be happy to help you, Master Link.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> However, should Link ask Paya about herself, she immediately becomes incredibly flustered.<ref>{{Cite|[What's your story?] You... I... Me... {{Big|You want to know my st-story?}}|Paya|BotW}}</ref> After a moment of hesitation, she begins to tell him about how she got her name.<ref name=\"Birthmark\">{{Cite|Well... My name is Paya. Th-the reason I was named Paya is because I have a birthmark shaped like a papaya seed...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks her where the birthmark is, Paya becomes flustered again and hides her face, struggling to tell him.<ref>{{Cite|[Where is it?] Well... It's kinda...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> At first, Impa comes to her rescue and asks Link leave such topics alone.<ref>{{Cite|Um, Master Link... I advise you change the subject.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Paya finishes by promising to tell Link where it is some day.<ref>{{Cite|I'll answer you some d-day... Just...just not today!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> However, once Paya's feeling for Link deepen, she does try to tell him where the birthmark is.<ref>{{Cite|It's on my l-left... Well... *ahem*|Paya|BotW}}</ref> As she struggles, Impa finally blurts out the answer for her.<ref name=\"Papaya\">{{Cite|It's smack in the middle of her left butt cheek!|Impa|BotW}}</ref> At the end of their talk, Paya wishes him good luck on his journey.<ref>{{Cite|G-good luck...|Paya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLater on, Paya is found in Impa's House on her knees, crying in distress.<ref>{{Cite|This is awful...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> She tells Link her eyes were averted for a second and asks what she should do.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Blue|Link}}... I swear I only took my eyes off it for a second! What should I... What should I do?|Paya|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks what is wrong, Paya answers that the Sheikah Heirloom was stolen just when she discovered its secret.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Heirloom}}... The {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}} has been stolen! And just when I had finally discovered the {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}}'s secret...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Paya then begins to sob. Impa explains that the hero chosen by the Sheikah Heirloom will be gifted with the \"blessing of antiquity\".<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Red|\"The hero, as chosen by the Sheikah heirloom, will be gifted the blessing of antiquity.}}|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Paya believes Link is the hero so she stayed up all night researching the heirloom, coming to the conclusion that the \"blessing of antiquity\" refers to an [[Ancient Shrine]], with the Heirloom acting as a key to reveal it.<ref>{{Cite|Paya thinks \"{{Color|BotW Red|The hero, as chosen by the Sheikah heirloom}}\" is you, so she stayed up all night researching the {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}}. She came to the conclusion that \"{{Color|BotW Red|the blessing of antiquity}}\" refers to one of those {{Color|BotW Red|ancient shrines}}. And the {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}} is the {{Color|BotW Red|key that opens the shrine}}.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Before they could tell Link this the Heirloom was stolen.<ref>{{Cite|And just before we were able to tell you this, the thing is stolen!|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Paya says she had been cleaning the Heirloom regularly every day, meaning it must have been stolen during the night.<ref>{{Cite|I had been cleaning the {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}} regularly every day from morning to dusk. Someone must have stolen it during the deepest hour of the night.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> The place is off limits to outsiders and Paya does not believe a villager would do such a thing.<ref>{{Cite|This place is off limits to outsiders... And no one from the village would do such a thing! Would they?|Paya|BotW}}</ref> This starts the [[Shrine Quest]], \"[[The Stolen Heirloom]]\". Paya continues by saying someone with evil intent had come there, and although she is glad of her grandmother's safety, she still feels violated.<ref>{{Cite|Someone with evil intent came into this sacred place. I'm glad Grandmother is safe, but I still feel so...violated.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Paya starts crying again. Because Paya is afraid the thief is possibly still nearby, Impa asks Link to stay by her side for the day.<ref>{{Cite|Link... Paya is afraid that the thief may still be nearby. Would you please stay by her side today?|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Link answers with a nod.\n\nIn her room that evening, Paya thanks Link for staying by her side the whole day and sees how crying and feeling scared will not help them get the Heirloom back.<ref>{{Cite|Master Link... Thank you for staying by my side for the whole day. I see now that crying and feeling scared won't help us get the {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}} back.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> [[Dorian]] and [[Cado]] had said no one other than the villagers were around at the time of the theft when she asked them.<ref>{{Cite|I checked with Dorian and Cado, but they said they didn't see anyone other than villagers around.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Paya says she will try to remember all she can about the night the Heirloom was stolen but is concerned the thief is still nearby.<ref>{{Cite|I'll try again to remember all I can about the night the {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}} was stolen, but the thief may still be hiding nearby.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Feeling uneasy, Paya warns Link that if he spots any suspicious movement not to approach.<ref>{{Cite|I have a bad feeling. If you spot any suspicious movement at night, {{Color|BotW Red|don't approach}}...|Paya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter Link completes the [[Lakna Rokee Shrine]], he returns to Impa's house and finds a depressed Paya.<ref>{{Cite|Oh... {{Color|BotW Blue|Master}} Link... Because I wasn't there...the heirloom... Our precious Sheikah heirloom...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> The Sheikah girl perks up when she hears the Heirloom fulfilled its purpose, expressing happiness that it was able to help Link in some way.<ref>{{Cite|What?! Oh... So that means the heirloom...has finally fulfilled its purpose... Thank goodness!... So long as it was able to help you out in some way, I couldn't be happier!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Paya prays the protection of the [[Golden Goddesses|gods of old]] follows the hero wherever he goes.<ref>{{Cite|I pray that the protection of the gods of old follows you wherever you go...|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Later on, Paya will express some loneliness without the Heirloom, though she is still grateful that Link found it useful.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, it was always trouble taking care of the Shiekah heirloom. But... I've grown quite lonely now that it's gone...|Paya|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It's a little lonely here now that the Shiekah heirloom is gone... Still, I'm so happy it was of use to you.|Paya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nPaya keeps a [[Paya's Diary|Diary]] in her room. If Link tries to read it, she says he must not and that it is just a simple journal she writes her personal thoughts in.<ref>{{Cite|You m-m-musn't! It's nothing more than a s-single journal where I jot down my personal thoughts. Please don't trouble yourself over it.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> However, Paya's Diary can be read at night when she is not in the room. On the first page, Paya has written how her grandmother, her aunt [[Purah]], and [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]] put a lone swordsman into a long sleep a century before to prepare for a foretold event.<ref name=\"Paya's Diary\"/> For the sake of [[Hyrule]] and her grandmother, who has been waiting for the hero to reappear, Paya prays he comes soon.<ref>{{Cite|Since then, Grandmother has been waiting for him to reappear after all these years. I, too, pray that he comes soon. For the sake of Hyrule...and for Grandmother's sake as well.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> Deeper in the diary Paya wrote about Link and his memory loss, commenting how despite this her grandmother is much happier.<ref>{{Cite|After sleeping for ages, Master Link has finally awoken. It seems his memory is completely gone... But that hardly mattered to Grandmother. I believe this is the first time I've ever seen her quite so happy.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> Paya thinks Link looks gallant, the very picture of the hero she always imagined.<ref>{{Cite|Master Link himself looks so gallant... He is the very picture of the hero I always imagined.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> She poetically describes his features in admiration, writing how her heart won't stop beating a mile a minute.<ref>{{Cite|His blond sideburns flow like a golden waterfall over his dignified, pointy ears. And the way his hair is so perfectly parted to the side, wow! I don't know why, but my heart won't stop beating a mile a minute...|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> In her Diary she admits she is still not great at interacting with young men.<ref>{{Cite|I must admit, I'm still not great at interacting with young men.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> Although, Paya thinks she can finally speak to Link while looking in his eyes, and while she still gets a little embarrassed, her gaze always follows his.<ref>{{Cite|But I think I am finally able to speak to Master Link while looking him in the eyes! Those wonderful eyes... Naturally I still get embarrassed...but I can't help it! I always follow his gorgeous gaze with my own.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> Paya suspects Link maybe in love with Zelda, stating they suit each other and gives their pairing her full support, even though the thought makes her heart hurt.<ref>{{Cite|I wonder if Master Link is in love with Princess Zelda... If so, I think they suit each other quite splendidly. If they became a couple, I'd give that pairing my full support. Though just the thought of that makes my heart hurt...|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> Thinking she may be sick, Paya explains her troubles to Impa, who only smiles.<ref>{{Cite|When I asked Grandmother for some medicine, she just sat there with a grin on her face.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> She attempts to get answers from Cado and Dorian, but the result is the same.<ref>{{Cite|I went to Cado and Dorian to ask them what that meant, but they just grinned at me too.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> Eventually, Paya and Impa talk about her feelings and she realizes that she is in fact in love with Link.<ref>{{Cite|I spoke to Grandmother about what's been weighing on my mind lately. For the first time...my heart knows what it means to love.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref> Although she realizes it is likely to remain unrequited, Paya is happy just to know what it feels like to be in love and is grateful to Link for giving her this new emotion.<ref>{{Cite|Though it may be a love that is never shared or returned, just having it for myself is gift enough. Seeing him brings me great joy... I bet he has that effect on everyone. I have only gratitude toward him for showing me what it's like to feel this way about someone.|Paya's Diary|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Paya while she sits at the table her Diary is on, she tells him not to frighten her and asks if he needs something.<ref>{{Cite|P-please don't frighten me like that! Do you need something from me at this hour?|Paya|BotW}}</ref> If he asks what she is doing, Paya replies she is jotting down her boring thoughts.<ref>{{Cite|I'm just j-jotting down some thoughts... Just my boring daily affairs and such. Really! Th-that's all it is!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> When Link asks what is on her face, Paya panics before realizing he means the [[Sheikah Symbol]] on her forehead.<ref>{{Cite|Wh-wh-what?! There's something on my face? What are you speaking of... Oh! Are you perhaps refering to this crest?|Paya|BotW}}</ref> She explains the crest is a talisman for the Sheikah to ward off evil.<ref>{{Cite|This symbol is a sort of talisman for the Sheikah. It wards off evil.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> It is customary for those with a long Sheikah lineage to have it inked on their foreheads to honor their past.<ref>{{Cite|It is customary for those with a long Sheikah lineage to have this crest inked onto their skin to honor their past.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> After answering any of Link's questions, Paya asks if her answer is alright with him.<ref>{{Cite|Is that...OK with you?|Paya|BotW}}</ref> When Link says goodbye, Paya encourages him to get some sleep since staying up late cannot be great for his health.<ref>{{Cite|It's almost dawn. If you haven't slept yet, you really should... Staying up late can't be great for your health.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> Paya is very shy about her room and if spoken to standing in it rather than sitting at the table, she will ask Link to leave.<ref>{{Cite|M-Master Link! Th-this is my private bedroom! Kindly take your leave!|Paya|BotW}}</ref> If Link listens to her while she sleeps, Paya murmurs his name.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|Master Link...}}|Paya|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf at any time Link attempts to speak to her without any [[Armor]] covering his torso, Paya will become incredibly embarrassed and hide her face, asking him to clothe himself.<ref>{{Cite|M-Master Link! Th-that immodest outfit is quite unbecoming of a hero like you. P-please cover yourself up this instant!|Paya|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Initially, Paya was to be a very young girl, but due to a lack of girls around Link's age in the world, she was changed to be a young woman between 18 and 20 years old instead.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= CaC |publisher= |page= 107}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nPaya's name comes from the fruit \"Papaya\" because she has a papaya-shaped birthmark on her left buttock.<ref name=\"Birthmark\"/><ref name=\"Papaya\"/>\n\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Paya Concept Artwork.png|Concept artwork of {{Term|BotW|Paya}}\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hyruleans, Kakariko Villagers, Sheikah\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
