Raven works for [[Oberon]] and is one of the Tricksters in the animated series.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nRaven has at least three known forms: a large black raven, a gargoyle-like being with a raven\u2019s head, and a dark-haired, arrogant-looking man with \"elvish\" features.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[Heritage]]===\nRaven is known for being a hostile crow towards the Avalon World Tourists. He is also a misanthrope who goes on a prejudice against humans who destroyed his clan. Raven is very notorious for tricking Goliath and Angela into confronting [[Grandmother (Gargoyles)|Grandmother]] going on a search of [[Natsilane]]. He is also very despicable in summoning a bear to kill Eliza. Bronx was able to defeat the bear that was summoned by him.\n\nRaven has more despicable tricks, such as sending some illusions that are supposed to be the survivors of his clan. The illusions consist of a bear, a wolf, and an eagle. Raven finally made his last stop at the volcano of Queen Florence. Natsilane came up during a battle against him to stop ruling this land. Raven summoned the totemic beasts to stop his assistants. Natsilane defeated Raven and the illusions are smashed by the Manhattan Clan. Raven later fled the volcano in retreat.\n\n===[[The Gathering (Gargoyles episode)|The Gathering: Part One]]===\nSince Raven was defeated by Natsilane in his first appearance, he returns to Avalon for the Gathering in line with the other Children of Oberon. Raven did not speak in this episode.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nRaven as raven.jpg\nRaven as a gargoyle.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.gargwiki.net/Raven Raven] at [https://www.gargwiki.net/Main_Page GargWiki]\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Child of Oberon]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Ravens]]"
