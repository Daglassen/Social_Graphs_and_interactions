== Biography ==
Kachoo is a Gerudo who manages the Inn at the Kara Kara Bazaar. She is upset that the Inn has been losing business ever since the Divine Beast Vah Naboris showed up in the Gerudo Desert. Kachoo assures Link that while the Divine Beast may be loud, the beds at the Inn are still comfy. If Link speaks to Kachoo while wearing the Gerudo Set, she says that the clothes look nice on him. After Link calms Naboris, Kachoo says that people can sleep soundly at the Inn now without the constant stomping.
