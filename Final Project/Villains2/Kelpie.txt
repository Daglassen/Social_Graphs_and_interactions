When it was captured, it was in chains and it was muzzled.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n* '''Fangs/Canine-teeth''': The Kelpie has sharp teeth that can bite creatures.

It also finds a way to strike from the inside and make sure the target does not have a clue that it is being hunted.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Another Kelpie was seen in [[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]\n*The Kelpie was one of the Top 13 Threats to the Magical Community.\n*The real-life Kelpie was a malevolent shape shifting water monster from Scottish folklore that often took the form of a horse.\n*When [[Silver]] was demonstrating the Kelpie's escape<ref>[[Something Fishy This Way Comes]]</ref>, the Kelpie is shown\u00a0much larger than the guards, but when he was chasing the guards, he is now short as a human.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (19).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (32).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (33).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (35).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (36).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (37).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (38).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (40).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (41).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (42).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (43).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (45).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (50).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (51).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (53).jpg\nSomething Fishy This Way Comes (54).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
