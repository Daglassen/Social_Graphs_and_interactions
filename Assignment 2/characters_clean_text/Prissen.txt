Prissen is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Prissen can be found at the Dueling Peaks Stable with his twin brother, Domidak. When Link approaches them, he will overhear Prissen excitedly telling his brother about a hint toward the bandit Misko's treasure. Domidak is quick to quiet him when he notices Link listening in, but Prissen can't help boasting about how close they are to finding their latest target. His brother immediately chastises him and Prissen apologizes for his overzealousness. 
Domidak will try to throw Link off by saying Prissen is rambling to keep him off track of the treasure, but if Link is persistent, Prissen will recommend they just tell Link their information to get him to go away. His logic is that since the two of them are having such difficulty, Link is unlikely to find the treasure before them. Domidak agrees, but demands a fee of 100 Rupees out of Link, and Prissen praises him for his quick thinking.
Once Link agrees and pays the fee, Prissen will praise Domidak once again for netting them some Rupees. Domidak will share their information as promised and Prissen continues to gush over his older brother's accomplishment. Once the conversation is over, the Side Quest "Misko, the Great Bandit" begins.
Domidak will continue to ponder the riddle, thinking he's close to uncovering its meaning, and Prissen will naturally cheer him on. If Link tells them to keep up their work, Prissen rudely dismisses him and demands that his brother handle the issue.
Link can let them both know that he already solved the riddle, even if the Side Quest has not yet been completed, but they do not believe him. Prissen goes on to declare that Link could not have found the solution before his brother. He immediately tells Domidak to get rid of him.
