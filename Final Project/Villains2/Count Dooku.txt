Hundreds of senators are now under the influence of a Sith Lord called [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]].|Dooku to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]}}\n\n'''Count Dooku''', also known as '''Darth Tyranus''', is a major antagonist in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. Once the [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] and former apprentice of Jedi Master [[Yoda]] and Master of [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], Dooku fell to the Dark Side, becoming the second apprentice of [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] and head of State of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] after Qui-Gon's death at the hands of [[Maul]]. \n\nDooku secretly plotted to kill and overthrow his master, unaware that he had plans of his own to replace Dooku with [[Anakin Skywalker]]. As such, when the right time came, Palpatine had Dooku duel Anakin, who defeated and subsequently beheaded him at Palpatine's urgings.\n\nHe is the main antagonist in ''Attack of the Clones'' and in the ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film and television series, and a minor antagonist in ''Revenge of the Sith''.\n\n==Background==\n===Biography===\nDooku was born into a rich family on the planet Serenno, and was to become the future Count of his homeworld. However, he instead chose to become a [[Jedi]], training under Jedi Master [[Yoda]] before becoming a Jedi Master himself. According to Jocasta Nu, he was one of the finest Jedi that the Jedi Order has ever had. Eventually, he would take an apprentice, [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], who eventually obtained the rank of Jedi Master. At some point after Qui-Gon's death at the hands of [[Maul]], Dooku resigned from the Jedi Order. [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]], secretly known as \"Darth Sidious\", who had lost his apprentice, [[Maul]], offered Dooku the chance to join him. Tempted by the offer, Dooku became the Sith Lord known as \"Darth Tyranus\". Dooku then began to rally thousands of star systems to the Separatist cause.\n\n===Personality===\nDooku is high stoic, calm, relaxed, confident, cunning. Dooku is amoral and highly apathetic, but not incapable of emotional experiences. He was visibly shocked when Jango Fett was killed in the Geonosian Arena by [[Mace Windu]]. Dooku is an accomplished philosopher, orator, politician, and warrior.\n\nEven as a child, Dooku felt driven to succeed. He was fully devoted to the ideals of the Jedi Order and the ideal of service to the galaxy. He sought to become a great Jedi Master, and for the vast majority of his life, he did not even consider the possibility of a life outside the Jedi Order. He knew of his heritage as a nobleman and felt self-conscious about it on occasion in his younger days. Dooku chose Jedi padawans he thought had the potential to become great Jedi themselves and endeavored to teach them all he knew.\n\nDooku had very high expectations about the government as a Jedi, and was viewed by his peers as a \"political idealist\". He became increasingly disillusioned with the corruption within the [[Galactic Republic]] in the period before his defection from the Jedi Order, and eventually held the opinion that the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. In particular, he was highly critical of the Jedi Council's handling of the Battles of Galidraan and Baltizaar, as well as their refusal to become involved in the Battle of Naboo. The Council's perceived betrayal of the ideals of the Jedi Order greatly influenced Dooku in his fall to the dark side. Dooku also never forgives betrayal, appearing to have virtually no tolerance for it.\n\nAs Tyranus, Dooku became a Humanocentrist. While he remained a connoisseur of alien art and antiquities, he secretly despised most if not all of the aliens on the Separatist Council, though he reserved a measure of respect for the Geonosian Archduke and Separatist Council member Poggle the Lesser. He divided the entire galaxy into two categories: threats and assets. The threat category was for beings or institutions that interfered with his personal advancement and would have to be eliminated. The asset category being for those who could aid, or at least not hinder his advancement.  He also had a certain fondness for Obi-Wan Kenobi, partially because he was taught by Dooku's Padawan. This was shown when he asked Obi-Wan to join him in his quest of power and even telling him the truth that the Republic was governed by Darth Sidious, though the Jedi didn't believe him.\n\nBy the time of the Clone Wars, Dooku believed that the sorrow and injustice of the galaxy could only be responded to with anger and hate. He came to believe that the Jedi Order should embrace the dark side and rule the galaxy alone without the interference of the Senate. As Tyranus, he planned to transform the Jedi into a Sith Army and intended to forcibly recruit Force-users into its ranks. While often assuming a genteel and civilized manner, Dooku showed no qualms about torturing or ordering the deaths of hundreds of his former comrades, nor about committing any number of atrocities as leader of the Separatists. He was also willing to abandon or even kill his own allies and followers in order to achieve his goals or simply to prove his loyalty to his Sith Master, [[Palpatine]] but was secretly planning to betray his master just as Sidious had betrayed and murdered Darth Plagueis.\n\nLike most members of the Sith Order, Dooku is incapable of acknowledging or learning from his mistakes, at least for the most part. Every time he used Dun M\u00f6ch to taunt Anakin, it would backfire, causing him to doubt Dooku's abilities. This just encouraged Anakin to draw on his anger and nearly allowed him to kill Dooku. Eventually, this led to Dooku's death at the hands of Anakin on-board the Separatist flagship ''Invisible Hand'' during the Battle of Coruscant. However, at that point, he had been led to believe that Palpatine would come to his aid to turn Anakin to their side or dispose of him.\n\nDooku is very arrogant, as shown when he became annoyed every time his then-apprentice [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], tried to help creatures that he deemed inferior. However, despite his arrogance, he also showed respect to his enemies, having a certain level of respect for [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and considering him a worthy opponent. Moments before his death at the hands of [[Anakin Skywalker]], Dooku also silently acknowledged Anakin as the finest lightsaber duelist that he had ever seen.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''[[The Force|Power of the Force]]:''' Despite Dooku's old age, he has an extremely strong connection to the Force, being one of the most powerful Force-users in the history of the galaxy. He also arrogantly claimed himself to be more powerful than any individual [[Jedi]] of his time. However, despite this claim, Dooku's Force powers were not enough to surpass that of [[Yoda]], [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]], and [[Anakin Skywalker]], at their peaks.\n**'''Telekinesis:''' Dooku can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. His powers allow him to affect small structures, notably damaging parts of a ceiling to rain down debris on his former mentor, Yoda, who caught and discarded them with ease. Dooku was also able to collapse an entire cave entrance on Vanquor to trap [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and Anakin inside with several Gundarks.\n***'''Force Push:''' Dooku can telekinetically send his opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed.\n***'''Force Pull:''' Dooku can telekinetically pull his opponents or objects towards him.\n***'''Force Choke:''' Dooku can telekinetically choke his opponents to either weaken, kill or intimidate them. His proficiency with this power allows him to throttle his targets without looking at them, as he did to Queen Miraj Scintel, who he was still able to fatally injure despite releasing her.\n***'''Force Grip:''' Dooku can telekinetically lift his opponents off the ground and into the air, sometimes by the neck, to immobilize them. His powers also allow him to influence the movements of other individuals, as he was able to force the pirate Turk Falso to shoot his comrade while simultaneously choking him, while he performed a similar feat when he made Padme Amidala aim at and shoot Bec Lawise.\n***'''Force Levitation:''' Dooku can telekinetically levitate himself or slow down his fall to the ground.\n***'''Force Throw:''' Dooku can telekinetically cause objects and other individuals to be hurled toward a target at an astounding velocity.\n***'''Force Crush:''' Dooku can telekinetically crush objects or droids. He was able to destroy the base of a small tower in an attempt to have it fall on a defeated Obi-Wan and Anakin, all while simultaneously locking blades with Yoda, forcing his former master to end the duel while Dooku escaped on his ship.\n***'''Force Deflection:''' Dooku can telekinetically redirect incoming attacks such as blaster bolts or Force lightning, with or without his lightsaber, although it is difficult to do so. This allowed him to deflect his own Force lightning that had been redirected back at him by his former mentor, Yoda.\n**'''Mind Trick:''' Dooku can control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills.\n**'''Taming Beasts:''' Dooku can control the minds of animals.\n**'''Force Lightning:''' Dooku can create and project bright blue electricity from both his hands or fingers to torture or kill his opponents. He was notable able to levitate and repel targets using his lightning in a similar manner to telekinesis.\n**'''Force Valor:''' Dooku can temporarily push past physical limitations and renew his morale, stamina, accuracy and overall battle prowess through sheer concentration and willpower. He notably used this ability to overcome the disabilities caused by his advanced age, increasing his strength, speed, agility, and dexterity to unnatural levels.\n**'''Force Jump:''' Dooku can jump or leap at great distances.\n**'''Force Dash:''' Dooku can move at amazing speeds.\n\n====Abilities====\n*'''Master Lightsaber Duelist:''' Despite Dooku's old age, he is an extremely skilled lightsaber duelist, as he is one of the deadliest lightsaber duelists in the history of the galaxy. Dooku is one of the few known individuals proven to be able to fight on par against [[Yoda]].\n**'''Form II:''' Dooku is a master of Makashi, using it exclusively. He considered by many to be the most proficient practitioner of the style.\n**'''Dun M\u00f6ch:''' Dooku is extremely skilled in Dun M\u00f6ch.\n*'''Genius-Level Intellect/Master Tactician/Leader:''' Dooku is highly intelligent and wise. As a Sith General, Dooku is a highly skilled tactician and a very capable leader.\n\n===Weapons and Equipment===\n====Lightsaber====\nDooku's valued weapon and possession is his blue, later red-bladed lightsaber. Dooku's curved-hilt lightsaber was made out of Solid Heavy-Duty metal and Black alloy.\n*'''[[Lightsaber]]:''' Dooku had built his lightsaber shortly after becoming a Jedi Master and it had originally a blue colored blade. When Dooku left the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]], he took his lightsaber with him. Upon he joining the [[Sith|Sith Order]], Dooku converted his weapon into a Sith lightsaber by replacing the original blue crystal with a scarlet synthetic gem, improving the blade's cutting power at the expense of maneuverability, turning it into a red-bladed lightsaber. It would remain in Dooku's possession until his death. The Curved-hilt lightsaber was eventually destroyed when it entered the planet atmosphere of [[Coruscant]].\n\n==Film Appearances==\n===''Star Wars: Attack of the Clones''===\nAfter leaving the Jedi Order and becoming a Sith, Dooku began a Seperatist movement in the Galaxy under the command of his Master, Darth Sidious. When Obi-Wan Kenobi was tracking the bounty hunter, Jango Fett, to the planet of Geonosis, he found that Dooku was creating a new droid army and recruiting politicians, among them being Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who wanted revenge on the former Queen Padm\u00e8 Amidala for his defeat during the Invasion of Naboo. He reported to the Jedi Council, but was captured by Geonosians. While he was captured, Dooku attempted to turn him to the dark side. Obi-Wan talked to Dooku, who refused working with the Sith, to which Dooku reminded Kenobi that he trained his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, who had been killed by Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo. When Obi-Wan remained stubborn, Dooku revealed that [[Palpatine|a Sith Lord]] was controlling the Senate, but that the dark side of the Force had clouded the Jedi's vision.\n\nAfter Kenobi's apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm\u00e8 Amidala failed to rescue him, Dooku sentenced all three to death in the arena. He was overwhelmed when the trio broke free and killed the monsters that were supposed to kill them. However, he was prepared and brought out some [[Droidekas|destroyer droids]] to kill them instead. Master Windu came with a strike team of Jedi to rescue the three. They were all surrounded again by numerous battle droids, but were saved by Master Yoda and an army of clone troopers. Dooku fled the arena and returned to a command center, where he monitored the battle with Nute Gunray, Poggle the Lesser, and other Separatist leaders. When Gunray decides to escape with his ''Lucrehulk''-class Core Ships before they can be taken down by the Republic's clone army while still on the ground, Poggle hands Dooku the blueprints for what the Separatists dubbed the \"Ultimate Weapon\", that being the schematics for the future Galactic Empire's dreaded [[Death Star]], warning Dooku that if the Republic found out about it, the Confederacy would be doomed. Dooku assures Poggle that the blueprints will be safe with Sidious back on Coruscant.\n\nEventually, he left to return to Coruscant, but was spotted by Skywalker and Kenobi as he attempted to flee to a hangar. Both Jedi pursued him, but lost Padme on the way, who fell out of the ship (though the ship was hovering above ground, so she wasn't seriously hurt) when it took some damage from flak from the pursuing Geonosian fighters. In anger, Skywalker charged at the Sith Lord, allowing Dooku to zap him with Force lightning and briefly injure him. Obi-Wan was more calm, deflecting the lightning and engaging the Sith in combat, but Dooku wounded him with his lightsaber and Anakin returned with his and Obi-Wan's lightsabers. Dooku managed to disarm Anakin of one of the blades, but Anakin fought on with the second. Eventually, Dooku broke off briefly to assess Anakin's strength. Returning to the duel, Dooku cut off Anakin's right arm and prepared to kill them both, but Yoda arrived and confronted him. Despite Dooku's obvious power, Yoda quickly proved to be both stronger in the Force and more skilled with a lightsaber; he deflected all of Dooku's Force attacks with ease and quickly seized the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel. Unable to defeat Yoda, and worried of incoming Republic reinforcements, Dooku distracted the ancient Jedi Master by nearly causing a pillar to fall on Anakin and Obi-Wan, forcing Yoda to save them while Dooku fled, escaping in his personal solar sailer, even as it was fired on by Padme and several clone troopers who had arrived to reinforce the Jedi.\n\nDooku went to Coruscant to meet with his master, Darth Sidious, whom he gave the plans to their new weapon: the [[Death Star]]. He also informed him that the Clone Wars had begun, setting the Republic on a path to becoming a ruthless dictatorship.\n\n===''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith''===\nCount Dooku fought Obi-Wan and Anakin once more three years later on General Grievous' flagship, the ''Invisible Hand''. Grievous had captured Chancellor Palpatine and Dooku fought to make sure the Chancellor was not rescued. The Jedi used lesser styles to lull him into a false sense of confidence, before suddenly switching to more advanced styles to catch him off guard. Adjusting to this feint, Dooku took out Kenobi first and caused a balcony to fall on him and taunted Anakin as the battle continued between the two of them, as he had sensed Anakin was holding back, lest he give in to anger. An enraged Anakin eventually cut off both his hands and took his lightsaber as a souvenir. Palpatine, who was secretly Dooku's master Darth Sidious, ordered Anakin to kill him, shocking Dooku as this was never part of the plan as he knew it. After initial hesitation, Anakin brutally decapitated Dooku; Count Dooku's last thought was: \"the way of the Sith is treachery\".\n\nThis was Anakin's first cold-blooded murder, unknowingly paving the way for him to succeed Dooku as Palpatine's new apprentice as Darth Vader. Although Anakin expressed guilt for killing Dooku, stating that it was not the Jedi way, Palpatine assured and congratulated Anakin, stating that Dooku was too dangerous to be kept alive and saying Anakin's killing of Dooku was only natural in revenge for Dooku cutting off Anakin's arm, reminding Anakin of when he sought revenge on the Tusken Raiders for his mother's death.\n\n==Television Appearances==\n===''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''===\nCount Dooku is the main antagonist of the series and the master of other villains, Asajj Ventress and General Grievous, ordering them to carry out missions.  He is seen dueling Anakin and Obi-Wan on several occasions even beating anakin a few times.\n\nTowards the beginning of the war, Dooku sent Ventress to Toydaria in hopes of allying King Kantuunko with the Separatists. When Kantuunko decided to join the Republic, Dooku ordered Ventress to kill the king but was foiled by Yoda, and Ventress escaped Toydaria.\n\nLater, Dooku assisted his cyborg right-hand servant General Grevious on board his warship the ''Malevolence'', which possessed a powerful ion cannon that could destroy entire Republic fleets. As time went by, Grievous destroyed many Republic fleets and many warships, most notably the ''Triumphant'' during the battle of Abregado which had impressed Dooku. Later, Dooku ordered Grievous to attack a Republic medical station in the Kaliida Nebula. Grievous attacked, but during the battle, the ion cannon was badly damaged just as Republic reinforcements arrived to destroy the ''Malevolence''. Dooku informed Grievous via hologram that Senator Amidala was heading for the sector and if Grievous could capture her, the clones would have to retreat, giving enough time for the ''Malevolence'' to escape.\n\nGrievous captured the senator, but a Jedi invasion forced Grievous to flee. The ''Malevolence'' was destroyed when it crashed into a nearby moon, but Grievous escaped in his starfighter, and Amidala was rescued by Anakin, much to Dooku's frustration. Later, Dooku was informed of Viceroy Nute Gunray's capture on the planet Rodia. In response, Dooku sent Ventress to attack the ''Tranquility'', which was the ship Gunray was incarcerated on and was heading to Coruscant, and rescue Gunray.\n\nWhen Ventress and a group of battle droids infiltrated the ''Tranquility'' and fought the Jedi Luminara Unduli and Ahsoka Tano on board the ship, Dooku sent a signal to Senate commando Faro Argyus, whom he bribed, to liberate Gunray. Ventress was able to evade the Jedi and escaped with Gunray and Argyus.\n\nAfter their escape, Argyus was killed by Ventress when he tried to discredit her. Later, Dooku contacted Grievous, demanding more dead Jedi and clones. To set up a test for his second-in-command, Dooku used a Republic tracking beacon to trick the Jedi into thinking Gunray was on the third moon of Vassek and lure them into Grievous' fortress. Jedi Kit Fisto and Nadhar Vebb intercepted the signal and headed for Vassek with a small group of clones and made their way into the fortress. When they figured out Gunray wasn't there, Dooku appeared to the search team via hologram and offered them an \"alternative prize\".\n\nLater, Dooku contacted Grievous again and Grievous informed him that he killed all the clones and Vebb, but Fisto defeated him and escaped to Coruscant, to which Dooku replied that there was \"room for improvement\". Later, the Republic tracked Dooku down and Anakin and Obi-Wan infiltrated his frigate and cornered him as Republic troops arrived, but Dooku fell through an escape hatch before Anakin could capture him. Anakin went after him through the hatch, but Dooku delayed him with his force lightning. When Dooku reached the hangar, he boarded his solar sailor and escaped, but was pursued by Anakin and Obi-Wan using a stolen Separatist ship.\n\nThe Jedi opened fire on the Count and shot Dooku down, forcing him to crash-land on the planet Vanqor. Dooku attached a tracking beacon to his ship and escaped into the caves just as Anakin and Obi-Wan landed on the surface to capture him. Anakin destroyed the beacon and went with Obi-Wan into the caves. Dooku caused a cave-in with the force that trapped the Jedi and stole Anakin's lightsaber. After escaping the caves, Dooku came across a gang of Weequay pirates led by Hondo Ohnaka.\n\nDooku asked Hondo to take him to a civilized planet. Hondo and his gang took Dooku with them to their headquarters on the planet Florrum. Upon arrival, the pirates captured Dooku and disarmed him. Later, Hondo contacted Chancellor Palpatine and informed him of Dooku's capture and was holding him for ransom. He offered 1,000,000 credits in spice in exchange for Dooku. Palpatine sent Anakin and Obi-Wan to Florrum to confirm Dooku was indeed being held by the pirates. They found Dooku in a holding cell who warned them not to trust the pirates, but they did not listen and were captured by the pirates who were wanting to triple their pay. Meanwhile, Senator Kharrus, Representative Jar Jar Binks, and a group of clones led by Commander Stone arrived in Florrum to pay the pirates. Dooku, Anakin, and Obi-Wan escaped three times but were recaptured and imprisoned. Later, Anakin and Obi-Wan were taken to Hondo for electrical torture. Later, during a power outage caused by Jar Jar crashing a tank into a power field, Dooku killed the pirate guarding his cell and escaped.\n\nLater, Dooku gave General Lok Durd permission to construct the weapon called the Defoliator. Durd demonstrated the Defoliator's capabilities: it could incinerate organic life and leave battle droids unharmed. Dooku was impressed when the first test was successful but knew Durd only created the Defoliator to get a promotion. Dooku then instructed Durd to use the Defoliator on the Lurmen inhabitants of the isolated planet Maridun, so they could see how the Defoliator affected living creatures. Unfortunately, the attempt failed as a small group of clones and Jedi defended the Lurmen, and Anakin destroyed the Defoliator and captured Durd.\n\nLater, the Separatist leader Wat Tambor invaded and successfully took control of the planet Ryloth. Dooku gave Tambor strict orders to prevent the Republic from interfering with their control. However, the Republic arrived and broke through the Separatist blockade and proceeded to deploy clones and Jedi to the surface to liberate Ryloth from Tambor's control. Dooku ordered Tambor to steal every valuable resource from the capital city Lessu and escape Ryloth before the Republic arrives. TA-175, Tambor's tactical droid, kept in contact with Dooku against Tambor's orders. Later, clone troopers led by Jedi general Mace Windu and the Twi'lek freedom fighters led by Cham Syndulla attacked Lessu to capture Tambor.\n\nHowever, unknown to Tambor, Dooku planned to bomb Lessu whether Tambor had fled or not and TA-175 betrayed Tambor and fled in Tambor's vessel, leaving Tambor behind to be captured by Windu. Meanwhile, Dooku's plan to bomb Lessu ultimately failed as Anakin and Ahsoka shot down the bombers before they could drop the bombs. Later, Dooku allied with a Mandalorian terrorist organization known as Death Watch, led by Pre Vizsla, whose goal was to take over the planet Mandalore and defeat the pacifist government called the New Mandalorians, led by Duchess Satine Kryze. Dooku urged Vizsla to give the Republic a reason to send military presence to Mandalore, which Dooku believed would inspire a revolution. However, despite multiple assassination attempts, Satine proved her case to the senate and caused them to call off the occupation of Mandalore, despite the actions of an assassin sent by Dooku and Vizsla to kill her.\n\nWhen a frustrated Vizsla promised to attack Mandalore, Dooku told him to hold off his attack as he would likely end up ruling Mandalore for one day and that there were other ways to accomplish Death Watch's goal to conquer Mandalore. Later, the Galactic Senate refused to de-regulate the banks, and Techno Union officials contacted Dooku, suggesting he bring the war to Coruscant's doorstep. In response, Dooku ordered Grievous to send Demolition droids undercover to Coruscant to sabotage the capital. Meanwhile, on planet Raxus, Dooku publicly supported a peace treaty between the Republic and the Separatists. However, Dooku still planned to prolong the war. Grievous's successful sabotage of Coruscant prolonged Dooku's plans. After the attack, Dooku was informed that senator Mina Bonteri had been responsible for the peace treaty and ordered his agents to kill her, and Dooku later contacted the Republic and lied to them about a Republic attack on Raxus to cover up Bonteri's death, but was blown by spies.\n\nLater, Dooku hired two bounty hunters, Robonino and Chata Hyoki, to kill any senators voting against their new bill. The duo managed to injure or kill twenty senators but was arrested after an attempt on Amidala and Bail Organa's lives and the bill was vetoed. Later, in his lair on planet Serreno, he was informed by his Master of Ventress' growing power and Dooku decided to eliminate her. He ordered his droids to destroy their command ship, where Ventress was fighting Anakin and Obi-Wan. Anakin and Obi-Wan escaped while Ventress was seemingly killed. Unknown to Dooku, Ventress survived and escaped to the planet Dathomir where she enlisted aid from the Nightsisters. Later, Ventress and two Nightsisters turned invisible and used Jedi lightsabers to attempt to assassinate Dooku, who fought them. Dooku eventually defeated the Nightsisters and used Force lightning to send them off a cliff, which they survived. Dooku believed the Jedi were responsible for the attack and contacted Mother Talzin who informed him that she would find a replacement for Ventress. Later, Dooku traveled to Dathomir to discuss with Talzin the plans.\n\nShe mentioned Darth Maul, who Dooku knew had died on Naboo at the hands of Obi-Wan. Later, the Nightsisters presented a Nightbrother with enhanced dark Force abilities named Savage Opress to Dooku and he took Opress to Serenno to be his new apprentice. On Serreno, Dooku gave Opress his first task: attack a sanctuary on planet Devaron, which he carried out successfully. After informing Dooku of his success, Dooku congratulated him and promised one day they will rule the galaxy together. After training, Dooku sent Opress to Toydaria to capture King Kantuunko. Despite resistance from Anakin and Obi-Wan, Opress successfully captured the king but killed him in an escape attempt. When Opress returned to Dooku with the deceased king, Dooku got very angry and shocked Opress with lightning, causing Opress to beg for forgiveness. Dooku said that forgiveness is not the way of the dark side and continued electrocuting him.\n\nDuring the punishment, Ventress revealed herself to Dooku and reminded Opress that he is her servant. Despite his best efforts, Opress was no match for Dooku's Force lightning. Ventress angrily ordered Opress to continue, but he refused and attacked Ventress, giving Dooku time to flee. He soon confronted Ventress again, but she failed to defeat him and escaped in an escape pod, but not before blinding Dooku for the time being.\n\nLater, Dooku was informed of Jedi general Even Piell's capture and imprisonment in a Separatist prison called the Citadel on the planet Lola Sayu and figured out he had information on the Nexus Routes which could change the tide of the war. Because of this, Dooku pressured the sadistic warden of the Citadel and Separatist operative, Osi Sobeck, to interrogate Piell and his men about the Nexus Routes. Later, a group of Jedi and clones led by Anakin, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan infiltrated the Citadel frozen in carbonite, but their cover was blown when one of the clones accidentally triggered an electro-mine and was killed.\n\nDespite his best efforts, the Jedi evaded Sobeck's traps and successfully rescued Piell and his head naval officer Wilhuff Tarkin and many others. Dooku was furious and contacted Sobeck and ordered him to recapture Piell and his naval officers and capture the rescue squad, but Sobeck assured him that everything was under control and ended the transmission and proceeded to prevent the Jedi from escaping with Piell by destroying a Separatist ship and killed a clone named Echo, ho sacrificed himself to destroy the droids, but the Jedi and the surviving clones and naval officers fled to the caves below to contact the Republic for assistance. At the same time, Dooku attempted to contact Sobeck again, but Sobeck ignored him to cut off the Jedi's escape.\n\nEventually, Dooku was able to contact Sobeck, who informed the warden of the significance of the Jedi's capture, to which Sobeck swore to accomplish, but Dooku reminded him that Sobeck's promises to capture the Jedi were the only things that were keeping him alive. Although Sobeck sent Anoobas to track the Jedi and successfully killed Piell, Sobck ultimately failed to stop the Jedi from escaping the Citadel with the Nexus Route information and was killed by Ahsoka and the Jedi, clones, and the naval officers escaped. Later, Dooku sent Separatist operative Riff Tamson to assassinate Yos Kolina, the king of planet Dac, to disrupt tensions between the planet's two native species: the Mon Calamari and the Quarren, which Tamson carried out successfully and relations between the two races declined and the Quarren allied with the Separatists, while the Republic backed the Mon Calamari and sent an army of clones and Jedi to quell the tensions, but Tamson attacked the Mon Calamari on Dooku's orders and attempted to kill Prince Lee-Char, son of the deceased Yos Kolina, but the Republic forces drove him back and retreated.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''===\nCount Dooku is a playable character in ''Star Wars: Force Arena'' as a Legendary squad leader card.\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Relationshipslink}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original drafts for ''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith'', Dooku was to have been revealed by Palpatine to have orchestrated the Tusken Raiders' abduction and murder of Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother. However, this was written out because of the way it interfered with the dynamic of the duel.\n*George Lucas has stated that Palpatine tricked Dooku by telling him that if Anakin could defeat Dooku, Palpatine would intervene to stop the duel, and have Anakin join them. However, in truth, this was only a ruse for Palpatine to gain Anakin as his true apprentice.\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Dooku|Dooku}}\n*{{SW|url=/databank/count-dooku|text=Count Dooku}}\n**{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/p__/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|villains|Count Dooku|Villains Wiki}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dooku}}\n[[pl:Hrabia Dooku]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:Sith]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
