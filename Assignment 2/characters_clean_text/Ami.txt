Ami is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ami is a child who lives at the Wetland Stable on the edge of the Lanayru Wetlands. His brother Izra will direct Link to him for direction, stating it's great to have a little brother who pulls his weight. During the day, he can be found watching Yolero practice with the "Master Torch", where he'll proclaim his life is a joke before asking Link what he wants to know about the surrounding area.
When asked what's to the east, Ami will explain that Zora's Domain is about the only thing in that direct. If Link asks about the west, he'll mock Link and explain Hyrule Castle is that way. He'll also share that he's heard about a hidden escape route from the castle called the East Passage, which was supposedly made for the old Royal Family of Hyrule. To the north, he'll explain that there's Death Mountain and other things. When Link tries to leave, he'll ask if he wants to know what's to the south. If Link agrees, Ami reveals that he wishes he knew, and says to ask the people at Riverside Stable.
