Oh... Are you interested in taking my class \"Voe and You\"? I'm Ashai.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} explains that she teaches a relationship class during the day and a [[Cooking]] class at night.<ref>{{Cite|During the day I teach a class on the voe of the world, and at night I teach cooking classes.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} encourages {{Term|BotW|Link}} to attend the Cooking class at her home during the night and her relationship class in the barracks during the day.<ref>{{Cite|I teach a cooking class at my house at night. If you want, please stop by!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|My \"Voe and You\" class is in the barracks. If you'd like, please stop by.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking to Ashai in the classroom in the barracks before her relationship class begins, she asks if {{Term|BotW|Link}} is interested in sitting in.<ref>{{Cite|Oh... Are you interested in sitting in on my class \"Voe and You\"? It may even teach you a thing or two!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> She then assures {{Term|BotW|Link}} that there is no hurry and that class does not begin until everyone arrives.<ref>{{Cite|There's no hurry\u2014we won't be starting until everyone has arrived.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf {{Term|BotW|Link}} speaks to {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} during her relationship class, she invites {{Term|BotW|Link}} to observe if he is interested.<ref>{{Cite|Oh... Would you be interested in my class on interacting with voe in the world outside this town?|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> If {{Term|BotW|Link}} rejects her offer, {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} asks if {{Term|BotW|Link}} already has a loved one,<ref>{{Cite|Do you already care deeply for someone?|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> to which {{Term|BotW|Link}} scratches the back of his head in embarrassment. {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} then explains that the young girls in her class have never even met a man before and that it is her duty to prepare them for the world outside of {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Town}}.<ref>{{Cite|These young vai have never even met a voe before.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It's my duty to help prepare them for what they'll encounter in the world beyond Gerudo Town, good and bad.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nShould {{Term|BotW|Link}} agree to observe the class, {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} instructs everyone to demonstrate what they have been learning.<ref>{{Cite|OK, everyone! Let's show our cute observer what we've been learning in class!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} then asks the class what to do when a \"handsome voe\" approaches them on the street.<ref>{{Cite|Now then... You're walking down the street on your way somewhere, and a handsome voe you've never met approaches...|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Pasha|link}} stands up and answers that she would wave casually yet remain prepared in case he is a distraction for a bandit ambush.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would wave casually to him but also keep myself prepared in case he's a distraction for a bandit ambush!|Pasha|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} praises {{Term|BotW|Pasha}} for her solution and then reminds the class that sometimes men only look suspicious from being intimidated by a {{Term|BotW|Gerudo}}.<ref>{{Cite|Excellent thinking, Pasha! That's a prudent approach to a new situation.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Remember that sometimes voe may look suspicious but are just being wary due to the sight of a daunting Gerudo.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Dina|link}} then stands up to share her solution, saying that she would enthusiastically greet the man and approach with her hands empty.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would enthusiastically greet him, approaching with a smile and with my hands clearly empty!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} praises {{Term|BotW|Dina}} for her optimistic approach,<ref>{{Cite|Wow, Dina, that's a very optimistic approach to take!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> adding that friendliness is a great way to relax others.<ref>{{Cite|Being overtly friendly is an excellent way to put the stranger's mind at ease!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Lastly, {{Term|BotW|Risa|link}} stands to share her solution, saying that she would attack the man when he least suspects it.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would walk casually toward him and then strike a fierce blow when he least suspected it!|Risa|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} dismisses {{Term|BotW|Risa}}'s solution and tells her that it is a crime.<ref>{{Cite|Risa... That would be a crime...|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAshai also asks her students what they would do if they encountered an injured voe lying on the ground.<ref>{{Cite|In your travels, you come upon an injured voe lying on the ground. What do you do?|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Pasha responds that she will lift him over her shoulder and take him to the nearest person who can treat him.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I immediately lift him up over my shoulder and carry him to the nearest person who can treat him!|Pasha|BotW}}</ref> Ashai will praise this answer, but she'll remind Pasha to check for non-visible injuries before she moves someone.<ref>{{Cite|That's a very proactive answer, Pasha! Always be aware that an injured person may have non-visible injuries before you move them, though!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Next, Dina says she would figure out what's wrong with him and then make a medicine to treat him.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would determine what was the matter and make a medicine on the spot to treat him!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Once again, Ashai will say Dina has a great answer, but tells her to make sure he doesn't have any allergies to the ingredients she uses.<ref>{{Cite|Great answer, Dina! Just be careful that the voe doesn't have some sort of allergy to the ingredients in your medicine!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Finally, Rina will say that she would secretly take the voe back to her home, where she would help him recover.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would secretly bring him back to my home, where I could help him gradually recover!|Risa|BotW}}</ref> Ashai will say that while Risa's sentiment is sweet, her plan is basically kidnapping.<ref>{{Cite|Risa...<br>A sweet sentiment...<br>But also basically kidnapping.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nFor her third question, Ashai asks her students what they will do when they're approached and spoken to by a voe whose attention they've sought.<ref>{{Cite|You are suddenly approached by a voe whose attention you've sought, and he abruptly engages you in conversation.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Pasha says she would pretend not to speak his language.<ref>{{Cite|Hrm... I would pretend that I don't know how to speak his language.|Pasha|BotW}}</ref> Ashai comments that her approach is interesting since it could inspire curiosity, and she explains it's unrealistic that he'll know the language she pretends to.<ref>{{Cite|That's an interesting approach, Pasha! You could inspire some curiousity in the voe by doing that... Remember: it isn't unrealistic that the voe may actually speak the language you pretend to know, too!|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Dina claims she'll take the opportunity to examine his clothes to determine his social status.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would take the up-close oppurtunity to determine his social standing based on the clothes he's wearing!|Dina|BotW}}</ref> Ashai commends Dina on her good thinking, but reminds her that sometimes, if someone's nice clothes are dirty, they may wear something more casual.<ref>{{Cite|Ah, good thinking, Dina. Just remember that sometimes all of someone's good clothes are dirty, so they might wear something more casual.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> Lastly, Risa says she would grab his hand and twist his wrist until he'd agree to marry her.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I would grab his hand and twist his wrist until he agreed to marry me!|Risa|BotW}}</ref> Ashai is left without words, and she tells Risa to speak to her after class.<ref>{{Cite|Wha... You'd... Risa... Let's talk after class.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref>\n\nBefore her Cooking class begins, she tells {{Term|BotW|Link}} one might as well learn if there is more to learn.<ref>{{Cite|People around me say it's a bit much, but I say as long as there is something to learn, why not keep learning?|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> If {{Term|BotW|Link}} agrees with her, she comments on {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s innocent expression.<ref>{{Cite|Heehee... You're wearing such an innocent expression, but you understand, yeah?|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} also explains to {{Term|BotW|Link}} that she was planning a lesson on [[Creamy Heart Soup]], but she forgot the name of the {{Term|BotW|Hearty Radish|display=heart-shaped vegetable|link}} in the [[Recipe]].<ref>{{Cite|Hmm... I was planning on {{Color|BotW Red|creamy heart soup}} for the lesson today, but I'm being a bit forgetful, it seems.|Ashai|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I know that I need some {{Color|BotW Blue|fresh milk}}, one {{Color|BotW Blue|voltfruit}}, one {{Color|BotW Blue|hydromelon}}, and two heart-shaped vegetables...|Ashai|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I just can't recall what the heart-shaped vegetable was...|Ashai|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Ashai}} assures herself that she will remember eventually.<ref>{{Cite|Well, I'm sure it'll come back to me eventually...
