He was one of [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]'s henchmen.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearance===\nChunk is a rock-like toy from [[Sunnyside Daycare]]. He has protective shoulder spikes, poseable oversized limbs, and fists ready to smash anyone who gets in his way. He also has a hidden head spike which when pressed down switches his facial expression from friendly to fierce.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===\nChunk is first seen shaking hands with [[Jessie]] and welcoming [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys to [[Sunnyside Daycare|Sunnyside]]. He is later seen gambling with Lotso's gang inside a vending machine (their secret hideout) and helps Lotso and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] (after he is switched to \"Demo\" mode) imprison Andy's toys. When he and [[Sparks]] are putting Jessie in a cell later in the film, she kicks them both in the face. Chunk is eventually convinced of Lotso's evil by [[Woody]] and [[Ken Carson|Ken]], and reforms.\n\nIn the ending credits, when Sunnyside is turned from a prison into a paradise by [[Barbie]] and [[Ken Carson|Ken]] (who are now the new leaders of Sunnyside after Lotso's defeat), Chunk is shown handling a rough playtime with the toddlers in the [[Caterpillar Room]] as a tag-team with [[Twitch (Toy Story)|Twitch]], later switching places with Twitch so Chunk can rest.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Chunk appears to be based on the short-lived Rock Lords toyline from the 1980s.\n*[[Jack Angel]], who provided the voice of Chunk, also voiced Rocky Gibraltar and\u00a0Mr. Shark\u00a0in the [[Toy Story|first film]].\n*Although one of the strongest toys on Lotso's team, he's also the stupidest. When commenting on [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]]'s gullibility during the gambling scene, he tries to say, \"He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer,\" but either he doesn't know what a drawer is or he forgot, instead of saying, \"the place where they keep the knives,\" causing [[Sparks]] to reply, \"Neither are you, Chunk!\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nChunk Toy.jpg\nChunkangry.png|Chunk's angry face\nChunkhapp.png|Chunk's happy face\nToy-story-3-picture-8-lotso and gang.jpg\nLots-O-Huggin-Bear-disney-males-26226827-1920-1080.jpg\nChunk-sparks-stretch.jpg\nLotso-big -baby-chunk.jpg\nLotso-mr-and mrs-potato head.jpg\nToy story 3-ken-sparks-chunk.jpg\nChunk.jpg|The real-life toy version of Chunk by Thinkway Toys\nChunk of 7789.png\nChunk straight.png\nChunk Plush.jpeg\nChunk Action Figure.jpeg\nTurbo Chunk.JPG.jpg\nChunk7.jpg\nDSA Chunk.png|In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nDSA portrait chunk.png\nDSA Toy Story 3 Baddies.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{PixarWiki}}\n{{Toy Story}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[ar:\u062a\u0634\u0646\u0643]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
