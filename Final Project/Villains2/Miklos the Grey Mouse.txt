"{{Infobox character \n|image = Miklos_Mouse.jpg\n|appearance = Short and slender grey mouse\n|personality = Sly, manipulative, antagonistic\n|alignment = Bad\n|enemies = [[Mickey Mouse]]\n}}\n'''Miklos Mouse''' is a doppelg\u00e4nger of [[Mickey Mouse]] who often tries to take Mickey's place, convincing others he is the real Mickey Mouse. He has also attempted to frame Mickey on several occasions.\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nHe is deceptive and manipulative, taking advantage of looking like Mickey to take Mickey's house, friends, etc.\u00a0Miklos is a master of disguise, and has even tricked Mickey Mouse himself into thinking Miklos was the real Mickey, while convincing Mickey he was the fake.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHe is identical to Mickey Mouse in every way except one: he is grey instead of black. This has not stopped him from coloring his fur and fooling others into thinking him to be the real Mickey.\n==Appearances==\nMiklos appeared in ''Mickey's Dangerous Double,'' in which Miklos planned on killing Mickey and stealing his life in order to retire from his crimes. He\u00a0later returned in ''Mickey and the Grey Scourge'' where he teamed up with [[Pete]], and then ''Mickey and the 7 Boglins'' where he colored Mickey red and convince Mickey that he was the fake, but was foiled when [[Minnie]] realized Miklos wasn't Mickey and tricked him into getting a tattoo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nmickey_mouse_miklos.png\n98e0797bfe7a942c4edfea42dc783766.jpg\nd67688bb7b7c213bd3d15b4e4a88667a.jpg\nMickey11.png\nTopolino_contro_Topolino.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External Links==\n*[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse TVtropes]\n*[http://it.paperpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Miklos Paperpedia (Italian)]\n*[http://it.paperpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Topolino_contro_Topolino Paperpedia ''Against Mickey Mouse'']\n*[https://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Miklos INDUCKS]\n\n{{stub}}\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
