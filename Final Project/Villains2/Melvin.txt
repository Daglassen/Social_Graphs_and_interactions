He even threatened to kill Chicken Little and his father for child theft to which the two did not intentionally harm him. However, when his wife Tina arrives, she tells him that Chicken Little and his father Buck Cluck are not harming him.\n\n==Role in the film==\nWhen his son goes missing, he and his wife start looking for him, causing a massive invasion on [[Oakey Oaks]] and creating chaos. When Chicken Little and his father Buck are abducted, Melvin prepares to obliterate them in which his wife Tina with her being reunited with Kirby tells her husband to cancel his obliteration plan as well as turning off his big voice. Later when Oakey Oaks is being restored, he apologizes to the inhabitants of Oakey Oaks for the invasion.\n\n==Trivia==\n*At one point, Melvin wears a [[Mickey Mouse]] watch; however, Mickey shown on his watch has three eyes.\n\n{{Chicken Little}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Chicken Little characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
