He is a combat ship who works for a criminal organization called the [[Lemons]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearance===\nTony is modeled after the USS Independence (LCS-2), a trimaran Littoral Combat Ship in service with the U.S. Navy, jointly manufactured by Australian-based global ship building company and defense prime contractor Austal and American aerospace and defense corporation General Dynamics. Tony Trihull also somewhat resembles a shark in appearance with his grayish texture, pointy nose, gill-shaped side vents and his shape of teeth.\n\n===Personality===\nTony Trihull is loyal to his employers, the Lemons and is willing to help them with their evil plans and give them transportation when needed. Like his bosses [[Miles Axlerod]] and [[Professor Z\u00fcndapp]], Tony was willing to commit murder. For example, Tony threatened a crab boat to leave when he came near the Lemons' secret untapped oil reserves. Also, Tony tried to kill [[Finn McMissile]] when he discovered the Lemons' oil reserves and again when he tried to capture Z\u00fcndapp in [[London]].\n\n===Weapons and Gadgets===\n*'''Magnet''': Attached to a cable, this magnet helps Tony attract any metallic object.\n*'''Minigun Turret''': Located at Tony's sides, these guns are controlled independently by another vehicle in the cabin.\n*'''Missile Launcher''': Located at Tony's front, these missiles are for standard situations. It comes with a laser guidance system.\n*'''Torpedo Launcher''': Located at Tony's sides, these torpedoes are more deadly and are used at desperate times. Throughout the entire film, only one torpedo was fired and Finn McMissile distracted it with an unknown countermeasure, causing it to explode and fooling Tony.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cars 2]]''===\nTony is first seen confronting a crab boat when he is near the territory of where the Lemons' untapped oil reserves are located. Tony orders the boat to leave and threatens him with his missile launcher until the boat complies. Tony then returns to the Lemons' oil reserves where he is hauled up onto an oil platform with another combat ship. When the Lemons discovered that British secret agent [[Finn McMissile]] to be on the platform, Tony and the other combat ship aid the Lemons in pursuing McMissile when he starts to flee onto the ocean. Tony fires his missiles at McMissile, but the British spy dodges his attacks until Tony fires a torpedo at him, seemingly hitting McMissile. However, unknown to Tony and the Lemons, McMissile escaped unharmed and faked his death.\n\nTony is not seen again until in London where [[Professor Z\u00fcndapp]] attempts to board on Tony and escape after failing to kill [[Lightning McQueen]] and [[Mater]] during the third race of the [[World Grand Prix]]. However, McMissile stopped the Professor from trying to escape and proceeded to capture Z\u00fcndapp. Seeing this, Tony uses his magnet to stop McMissile and protect Z\u00fcndapp. McMissile tried to use his machine guns and missiles to disable the magnet, but fails when they all get sucked onto the magnet. Tony attempts to kill McMissile again with his missile launcher, but McMissile manages to dodge the missiles every time. Then, McMissile quickly decides to use the magnet to his advantage by releasing several mini-bombs out of his axels which cling on to Tony's magnet, resulting in a huge explosion resulting in Tony's ultimate demise.\n\n===''[[Cars 2: The Video Game]]''===\nTony appeared in the intro scene riding around the oil rig. Then, he appeared in one of the Oil Rig tracks, where if the player gets caught in a spot light, he says \"You don't belong here.\" Then a weapon will be aimed at the character, and the weapon would destroy the character.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-142.jpg|Tony Trihull's first appearance.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-148.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-158.jpg|Tony threatening a crab boat to leave.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-181.jpg|[[Finn McMissile]] clinging onto Tony.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-234.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-247.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-258.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-299.jpg|Tony being pulled up to an oil platform.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-665.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-669.jpg|Tony and another ship being dropped into the ocean.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-680.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-692.jpg|Tony firing his missiles at McMissile to stop him from escaping.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-717.jpg|(Acer: \"He's getting away!\") \"Not for long!\"\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-736.jpg|Tony searching for McMissile who manages to escape.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-9965.jpg|Tony in London as Z\u00fcndapp attempts to flee.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-10011.jpg|Tony using his magnet to stop McMissile from capturing Z\u00fcndapp.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-10044.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-10078.jpg|Tony attempting to kill McMissile.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-10099.jpg\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-10106.jpg|Tony's last moments before exploding.\ncars2-disneyscreencaps.com-10109.jpg|Tony's death.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* His missile turret is based on the General Dynamics/Diehl BGT Defence RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile.\n\n*The explosion that destroyed him would have also been large enough to kill Finn and Z\u00fcndapp. However, they were not affected, suggesting that Finn pulled them back fast enough as soon as his explosives were triggered.\n*During the end credits, Tony is credited as \"Combat ship.\"\n*Tony's voice actor, Lloyd Sherr is shared with [[Fillmore (Cars)|Fillmore]] in ''Cars 2''.\n*His body and overall appearance resembles that of a shark, by his grey color scheme, gill-like vents on his sides, and the shape of his teeth. \n\n==Navigation==\n{{Cars}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Cars characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Ships]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]"
