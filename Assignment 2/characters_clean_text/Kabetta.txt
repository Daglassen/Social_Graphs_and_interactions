Kabetta is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Kabetta is the youngest of the Goron Blood Brothers, consisting of him and his brothers Bayge and Heehl. Kabetta, along with his brothers, is passionate about training in difficult feats of strength and endurance. However, he is more docile and meek than his brothers. He lives with the rest of his brothers in a house in southern Goron City, which is now abandoned and left with a sign saying they have gone to the Gut Check Rock to train.
Kabetta is involved in the "Test of Will" Shrine Quest at Mount Nabooru in the Gerudo Highlands. Kabetta and the other Goron Blood Brothers have traveled  to their ancestral training ground to train themselves to withstand the heat in Goron City. Kabetta and the others challenge Link to join them by sitting in a ring of fire to see who can withstand the longest. Kabetta is the first Goron to collapse before Link is declared the winner. The brothers then challenge him to a harder contest by standing on an even hotter platform. Beating both of their contests reveals the Joloo Nah Shrine.
Kabetta also appears at the base of the Gut Check Rock in northern Eldin Canyon, laying on the ground in exhaustion after falling his Gut Check Challenge training. He encourages Link to take the Challenge.
