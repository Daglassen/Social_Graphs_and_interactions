He stays at {{Term|BotW|The Great Ton Pu Inn|link}} when visiting {{Term|BotW|Hateno Village}}, and can be found sitting on a chair inside.\n\nTeli is familiar with [[Robbie]] and the [[Akkala Ancient Tech Lab]] and reveals he has sold parts to him. He even wonders if Robbie is planning to rebuild a Guardian, indicating he is unaware that Robbie is using the parts to develop [[Ancient Soldier Gear]] to combat Guardians and Ancient weaponry to oppose [[Calamity Ganon]].\n\n====Wares and Pricing====\n{{Tab2\n|format= top\n|align= \n|default= 1\n|tabwidth= 12em\n|tab1= Normal Weather\n|content1=\n{{ShopItem/h|desc=yes}}\n{{ShopItem|BotW|Ancient Screw|48|typeimg=Icon|desc=A screw used in ancient machinery.
