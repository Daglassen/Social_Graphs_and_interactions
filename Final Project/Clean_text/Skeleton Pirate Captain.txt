possible that Barbossa and Blackbeard were replaced new captain following during the events the attraction off screen This could through mutiny crew election historically pirates democratically decided captains and quartermasters some events leaving the typical captain the Wench unable take charge Most members the crew could considered though should noted that the captain the attraction has hands meaning wouldn the Hook Hand Pirate Treasure Keeper and likely wouldn Redd not just due the pronouns regarding the captain removed scripts being him but also because Redd makes appearances New Orleans Square which she likely wouldn able she were cursed the grotto Treasure Raid Leader Prior the 2006 refurbishments the attraction another pirate leader different both Blackbeard and Barbossa

shop known Coffre Capitaine French The Captain Chest and the abode unidentified pirate captain who has pet parrot however unknown the shop was located Isla Tesoro would presumed for the captain being the proprietor and there are visible references the crew the Wicked Wench within Auctioneer The Auctioneer The Auctioneer was prominent member the Wicked Wench crew who made considerable profit during the raid Puerto Dorado off auctioning off stolen goods from the townsfolk his fellow crew mates dressed extravagant clothings and expensive jewellery fitting with the characterization the skeleton captain and modelled after artwork made for Captain Gore Bartholomew Roberts historic pirate captain who was once planned appear Disneyland undead pirate However the evidence for this theory considerably conjectural but would make sense for notable character seen guests the attraction the who assumed the role captain and the Auctioneer probably fits best into that role unused script for Pirates the Caribbean the captain undead parrot would have spoken and repeated lines from when the pirates were planning their raid Puerto Dorado such Morgan says the streets are paved with gold addition the parrot the captain would have had three chained pet crocodiles unused script for the attraction which would have been used keep the crew treasure safe"
