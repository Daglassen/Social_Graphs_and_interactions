"[[File:Sinister Sisters.jpg|thumb|250px|Sapphire, Sage and Scarlett Sinister]]\n'''Scarlett, Sapphire, and Sage Sinister''' are all evil witches attending [[Witch University]] and the daughters of [[Silas Sinister]]. While Sapphire and Sage act as the twin-followers, Scarlett acts as the ring-leader. They secretly defy the \"No Magic\" rule by using their powers whenever there is no teacher watching. They work with a few professors and their father to make [[Marnie Piper|Marnie]] open a box with the Cromwell family's ultimate magic in it. In the end, their plan backfires and they lose their family's magic and become humans as punishment for their father's crimes.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Halloweentown}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sinister Sisters, The}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Halloweentown characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
