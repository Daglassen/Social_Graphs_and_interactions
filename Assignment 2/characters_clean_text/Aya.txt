Aya is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Aya is a worker at the East Akkala Stable. She sits on a stool under the tree next to the Blue Flame Pedestal at all hours of the day. When spoken to, she will seem depressed. Upon questioning, she'll explain that her life has been dull since she married, and she previously used to pass the time by staring at the Blue Flame. However, she notes the director of the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab hasn't lit the fire in a while.
Link can offer to relight the Blue Flame, which triggers the Blue Flame Mini-Game. She will charge Link 20 Rupees as a horse-handling fee, since she doesn't see how else Link could complete the challenge that fast. She also makes a joke before sending Link out, pretending to count down and then telling Link this is what she'll say before he leaves. If Link returns the Blue Flame, Aya will be excited and give Link a Purple Rupee as a reward.
The next time the Blue Flame goes out, Aya will ask Link to bring it back in one minute. After this is done, Aya will reward Link with a Silver Rupee.
When the Blue Flame goes out a third time, Aya asks Link to relight the lantern in less than twenty seconds. The reward for doing this is a Gold Rupee. On subsequent visits, however, she will only be able to give Link twenty Rupees.
If the Blue Flame is out while it's raining, Aya will remark that Link shouldn't retrieve it due to the poor weather.
Aya is happier while the Blue Flame is lit. She asks Link if there's anything as pretty as the Blue Flame, but she doesn't think there is. She also finds the Blue Flame to be soothing, and wants to know if Link thinks the same. In addition, she will warn Link against putting it out, grumbling angrily if he does so.
