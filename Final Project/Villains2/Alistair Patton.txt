Patton}}\n\n'''Alistair Patton''' is the main antagonist of the [[1988]] Australian film, ''[[Return to Snowy River]]'', the sequel to the [[1982]] film, ''The Man from Snowy River''.\n\n== Role in the Film ==\nJessica is admonished for training a racing colt, and then told to put on \u201csomething more feminine.\u201d They are headed to a business meeting/horse race with a man named Patton and his son, Alistair. It becomes clear that Patton and his son have more on their minds than business that day. Alistair awkwardly presents Jessica with an engagement ring. Jessica disappears quickly into the crowd without giving any formal answer to Alistair, just as Jim shows up. The horse race begins and the Harrison colt wins with Jessica as the jockey.\n\nHarrison and Alistair swarm Jessica protectively and attempt to shoo Jim away, but he will not be so easily deterred. Only when Jessica tearfully rejects him and he is outnumbered 4 to 1, does Jim finally leave. On his way out, he manages to perfectly run through Alistair\u2019s series of cavalry tests using nothing but his bullwhip, his stirrup leather, and a wooden stake. With his son\u2019s ego on the line, Alistair seeks revenge. He vows to run off the mountain riff-raff and secure the grazing for the people of the valley. Back at home, Jessica starts to make vows of her own. One, she never wants to see or speak to Alistair again. Two, Jim is the man for her. Harrison has a lot to deal with, seeing as how Alistair is threatening to withhold a loan from him if the two families don\u2019t form a \u201cmerger.\u201d After her father tells her the Pattons'\u00a0dastardly plan, Jessica realizes she must stay away from Jim. She tells Jim they can not be together because the Pattons\u00a0would destroy her father and then they would destroy them.\n\nJessica moves into Jim\u2019s house and immediately takes the reins of his horse breeding business. She and Jim propose a contract with Harry Hawker, to provide 100 quality mountain horses to the military every year. Not only would it provide much-needed income for themselves, but it would drive business away from the nefarious Patton family. Alistair begins to formulate a revenge plan, but the mountains hold a little surprise for Alistair: a black horse named Stalker Brumby. Stalker Brumby kills one of Alistair\u2019s mob and the locals blame Jim and Jessica for the death. They give Jim a final ultimatum: kill Stalker Brumby and send Jessica home, or else. Meanwhile, Alistair hires a group of thugs to steal Jim\u2019s horses. Jim immediately saddles up Denny and heads out to rescue his herd. He jumps fallen trees and soars over ditches. He dives under fallen limbs. He makes the infamous leap until Alistair fatally shoots Denny.\n\nHarrison\u00a0has relented during this time, and he eventually joins with Jim and his friends to hunt down Alistair and his gang. Jim Craig gets and wins his man-on-man duel with Alistair, and Harrison gives his final approval for Jessica and Jim to marry.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Patton, Alistair}}\n[[Category:Return to Snowy River characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]"
