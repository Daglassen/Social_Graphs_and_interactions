She makes her only appearance in the episode \"[[Adventures in Mommy-Sitting]]\", where a series of events leads her to becoming enemies with [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] and [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]]. She is portrayed by Nina Millin.\n\n==History==\nWhile at a The Vault - a new club, she is bumped into by [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] who backs into her while dancing. Raven apologises, stating she didn't see her, but Brenda's tall height makes her doubt Raven's claim, and she mistakenly thinks she is being mocked. She warns Raven to watch herself next time. Raven bumps into Brenda again, this time while she holds a drink, causing to spill over her outfit. Raven panics and tries to clean the mess, but accidentally ends up tearing it. To stop Brenda from hurting Raven, [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]] intervenes, stating that Raven is a fashion designer, having made dresses for dogs for a living. Brenda assumes Chelsea called her a dog and threatens both of them, and the pair try to calm her down so they can escape, but the two end up running into a vault which Brenda locks them in.\u00a0She however notices the two escape and prepares to fight, but before she can, Chelsea snaps at her, having just wanted one night where to have fun, which was ruined by Brenda. When their conflict brings the attention of the bouncer, Brenda backs off and leaves them be.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nRaven's Home - 1x06 - Adventures in Mommy-Sitting - Bumping In.jpg\nRaven's Home - 1x06 - Adventures in Mommy-Sitting - Spilling Drink.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{That's So Raven}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Brenda}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Brenda}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Raven's Home characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
