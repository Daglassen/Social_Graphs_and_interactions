"[[File:Swampmonster.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''The Predator''' is a large monster with horns and fangs who frequently appeared as the secondary antagonist\u00a0of ''[[Dinosaurs]]''.\n\nThe creature first appeared in the second season episode \"[[I Never Ate for My Father]]\", where it was referred to as a swamp monster and consumed [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] and [[Robbie Sinclair|Robbie]]. The swamp monster is a hand puppet, matted to look like a giant creature. Every swamp monster seen on ''Dinosaurs'' looks identical. It takes a few days for the monster to digest his meals.\n\nIn its second appearance, in \"[[Slave to Fashion]],\" the puppet was used as the title character for the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Dinosaur_TV TV series] ''Totally Hidden Predator''. This was the first reference to it as \"The Predator\" and no other official name is known. The monster would continue to be seen both on television and encountering the Sinclairs in the wild.\n\nThis puppet originally appeared in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Maker Monster Maker]''. A photo caption in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/No_Strings_Attached No Strings Attached]'' refers to this creature as a demon.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dinosaurs]]''\n** [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_203:_I_Never_Ate_for_My_Father Episode 203: I Never Ate for My Father]\n** [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_222:_Slave_to_Fashion Episode 222: Slave to Fashion]\n** [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_310:_Wilderness_Weekend Episode 310: Wilderness Weekend]\n** [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_406:_Terrible_Twos Episode 406: Terrible Twos]\n** [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_413:_Into_the_Woods Episode 413: Into the Woods]\n\n==Trivia==\n*With Disney's adquisition of [[20th Century Fox]], Disney now owns the rights to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(fictional_species) the more familiar monster named \"the Predator\"].\n\n{{MuppetsWiki}}\n{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Predator, The}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Reptiles]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]"
