He is an egotistical Swedish champion who is [[Will Stoneman]]'s archenemy.\n\n== Role in the Film ==\nIn Winnipeg, Will is reluctant to let a 17-year-old race, but Henry Kingsley, seeing Will as good copy, supports him, and reminds everyone that Will may be fighting in a war soon. Will joins the other ten racers. Borg\u00a0tries to intimidate him from the start, but Joe Macpherson befriends him. In their luxury train, the sponsors of the race are betting on how long Will will survive, while Kingsley tries to find new angles for his story.\n\nThe race through the snowy wilderness is tough and gets tougher when the blizzard starts. Borg's dirty tricks put Joe and one of the Canadians out of the race, and later he sets his fierce wolfdog on Gus, Will's lead dog, injuring him badly. Will uses Ned's medicines to save his life, but Gus has to ride on the sled for the rest of the race.\n\nOn the last day of the race, Kingsley becomes genuinely concerned when he sees how bad Will's condition is, as he can barely move, and advises him to drop out of the race and see a doctor, but Will insists on finishing the race to the end. Will finds himself following Borg on a dangerous shortcut to the finish line, as it runs near a turbulent river. Will had been taking great lengths all through the race to dodge water obstacles because of what happened to his father, but he finds the courage to face this one, as Borg's dogs turn against him for using a whip.\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Iron Will]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
