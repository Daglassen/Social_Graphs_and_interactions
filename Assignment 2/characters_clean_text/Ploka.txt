Ploka is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ploka is a Gerudo soldier who guards the front entrance to the palace in Gerudo Town with Reeza. Before Link first speaks to Riju in the palace, the Hylian reporter, Traysi, is seen speaking to Ploka. If Link speaks to Ploka, she mentions that between him and Traysi, many Hylians have come by the palace. Ploka then explains that she guards the palace and that it is the home of Riju, Chief of the Gerudo. She also warns Link not to distract her from her duty. If Link says that he is a Gerudo, Ploka finds the notion ridiculous and yells that he is too short, his hair is not red and he does not have abs. If Link asks for entry to the palace, Ploka yells that they are busy with an emergency, but quickly explains that Riju is in fact allowing visitors. Ploka warns Link that if he says anything rude to Riju, she will attack him with her Spear. If Link speaks to Ploka after speaking to Riju for the first time, she comments that the stolen Thunder Helm is a failure shared by every Gerudo soldier. She feels that only Gerudo should be allowed into the palace at the moment.
After Link calms Naboris, Ploka comments that the Gerudo Desert is back to normal now. She also says that she thought Hylians were weak people, but admits that Link is not so bad.
