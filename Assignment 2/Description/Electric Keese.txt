They inhabit the [[Lanayru Desert]] area, and like other electrified enemies in that region, they produce small bursts of electricity that will stun and harm {{Term|SS|Link|link}} if he strikes one while it is shrouded in electricity. Though {{Term|SS|Thunder Keese}} are weak, they can be dangerous in large groups as they may constantly electrocute {{Term|SS|Link}}, giving him little opportunity to defend himself. A safe and effective way to eliminate them is to use the [[Shield Bash]] technique, knocking them to the ground, then finishing them with the [[Fatal Blow]].\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\n{{Compendium/Extract|Electric Keese}}\n{{Term|BotW|Electric Keese}} appear in {{BotW}}. They can be found in a variety of places such as [[East Necluda]], [[Lanayru Great Spring]] and the [[Gerudo Desert]]. When attacking {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}, they have the ability to shock him, which will stun him and cause him to drop any metal weapons he may be holding. Upon their defeat, Electric Keese may drop [[Keese Eyeball]]s or [[Electric Keese Wing]]s.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Ambig|Start}}\n==={{CoH|-}}===\n{{Stub|CoH}}\n[[File:CoH Electric Keese Sprite.png|left|100px]]\n{{Plural|CoH|Electric Keese}} appear as enemies in {{CoH}}.\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n==={{HWAoC|-}}===\n{{Stub|HWAoC}}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:HWAoC Electric Keese Model.png|{{Term|HWAoC|Electric Keese}} as it appears in {{HWAoC}}\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Ice Keese|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Keese|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Fire Keese|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Bat-Like Enemies, Electricity-Related Enemies, Flying Enemies, Keese\n |enemies= SS, BotW, CoH, HWAoC\n}}"
