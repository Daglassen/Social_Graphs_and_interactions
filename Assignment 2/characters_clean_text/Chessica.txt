Chessica is the proprietor of the Fishing Resort, an Inn in Lurelin Village. She welcomes Link as he arrives and, figuring he's tired, asks if he wants to stay. She offers a regular bed for 20 Rupees and a fluffy bed for 40 Rupees.
If Link declines to stay at the Inn, Chessica is disappointed but reminds him to stay another time. When Link does decide to stay, she asks him how long he wants to sleep. She encourages him to get to bed quickly.
