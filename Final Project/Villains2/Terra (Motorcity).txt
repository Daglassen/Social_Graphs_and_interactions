They are led by [[Kaia]].\n\n==Description==\nThe Terra fight to take revenge on [[Abraham Kane]] as well as the Deluxian. As a side effect of the dumping from KaneCo, the Terra themselves have been mutated. They conceal their appearances behind gas masks and headbands.\n\n==History==\nThe Terra were once a peaceful, eco friendly group of Motorcitizens until KaneCo ravaged their land with toxic waste dumped by the Toxo Tanks. While allied at first with the Burners, the Terra's ruthless tactics quickly ended the alliance.\n\nThe Terra tried to blow up\u00a0[[Detroit Deluxe]], and later bring down the plates Detroit Deluxe rests on, both which would have hurt innocent people, or have crushed [[Motorcity]], but the Burners managed to stop them each time.\n\n==Village==\nThe members live in a village on the outskirts of Motorcity, in an area that was decimated by KaneCo's waste dumping with his Toxo tank.\n\n==Weaponry==\nThe Terra use rapidly-growing plants that have been mutated by KaneCo pollutants into crossbow like weapons. The \nTerra Dwellers also Have Vine Bullwhips & Spears.\n\n==Appearances==\n#105. \"Texas-ify It\"\n#118. \"Mayhem Night\"\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nTerra Concepts 1 by Mark Ingram.jpg\nTerra Concepts 2 by Mark Ingram.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Motorcity}}\n[[Category:Motorcity characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
