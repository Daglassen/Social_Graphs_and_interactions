He is an evil version of [[Julian (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|Julian]] created as a result of him coming into contact with one of the [[Chaos Pearls]].\n\n==Appearance==\n===Everyday Form===\nEvil Julian resembles Julian, but the dark purple colors in regular Julian turn white, and Evil Julian has bright blue eyes. The lightning-shaped necklace also becomes a skull-shaped necklace, and the skull in front of his hat gains a hat itself.\n\n===Monster Form===\nWhen Evil Julian transforms into a monster, the tails in his tailcoat act as legs with oversized arms. His face slightly resembles a skull and is less spidery, and there are three lines underneath each eye. When the Norrisville Ninja tries to stab Shadow Julian's hat, the hat does not break. The tails in his tailcoat can regenerate from an attack. From \"[[Mastermind of Disastermind]]\" onward, Randy calls him \"Evil Cyborg Julian,\" as Evil Julian encases himself in machinery to give himself an advantage.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n''For more information of his powers see [[Julian (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|Regular Julian]]. After being separated from regular Julian, Evil Julian possess a variety of abilities when he is in contact with a [[Chaos Pearls]]. This makes him a formidable opponent that Randy had to face as antagonist and for Randy to defeat alone.''\n\n*'''[[Dark Magic]]:''' Even without a Chaos Pearl Evil Julian had some form of dark magic which were communicating from/to the Land of Shadows through mirrors, switching places with his real counterpart, and also absorbing light when he is walked on the streets. With a Chaos Pearl, Evil Julian possess even more supernatural abilities, which were Levitation as he floated off the ground, summon flames and make them appear from the ground, or use Telekinesis to summon nearby objects/technology and assemble them to create a battlesuit that is powered by his Chaos Pearl. He can also manipulate and generate green electricity or fire energy blast which sometimes look similar to a lighting bolt in either his normal form or battlesuit. He also opened portals to the [[Land of Shadows]] to summoned his own monster out of the dark realm. After he absorb all four of the lost Chaos Pearls he also gained newer abilities like Teleportation and control over the weather when he created a green colored storm that was forming over Norrisville until his defeat. \n**'''Mind Control:''' In one episode, when everyone in Norrisville drank the infected water, Evil Julian was able to use his orb to mind control everyone to find the other Chaos Pearls (Randy was able to counter Evil Julian\u2019s control with his own Chaos Pearl). Near the end of that episode after he got Randy's and Howard's orb and destroyed theirs to gain their powers, he orders the remaining one (which was inside everyone in Norrisville) to come to him, giving him the power of all four lost orbs.\n**'''Power Absorption:''' Evil Julian can drain the dark magical powers of the other Chaos Pearls and put it in his own power ball to become more powerful. He first used this after he destroyed both Howard's and Randy's ball with his bare hands and he then drained the Chaos Pearl energy from everyone who drank the infected water to return him, giving him the power of all four orbs. Later in the series final episode he absorbs all The Sorcerer's dark magic by using his own power ball to become more powerful, forcing Randy to team up with The Ninja's archenemy The Sorcerer in order to beat him.\n*'''Super Strength''': In his human form, Evil Julian appears to gained a few superpowers as he is also stronger physically than normal Julian, as stated by Randy, and might even possess inhuman strength and other inhuman attributes. This was demonstrated while trading blows and being capable of utterly defeating/manhandling Randy (while wearing the [[Ninja Suit]]) in their first fight in his human form. In his battlesuit he is more stronger and durable to easily lift and throw Randy into a wall and survive inhuman things like explosions. Originally it was unknown if this was with the aid of the Chaos Pearl since it boosted his powers or if it was part of his enhanced physiology, but it was later seen during one battle he broke solid concrete (which takes 4000 newtons 899.24 pounds) with a punch while fighting Randy, it proved Ghoulian has inhuman strength.\n*'''Transformation''': Even before he had a Chaos Pearl, Evil Julian can change himself into a monster at will and back again (with no needing of [[stank]]). This made it nearly impossible for Randy to destank him. But Evil Julian willingly switches/changes himself back to human form later on to fool Randy. While in his monster form he possess a variety of enhanced attributes like superhuman strength, speed, and durability.\n*'''Hand-to-hand combat''': Evil Julian is shown to be skilled in basic hand-to-hand combat but isn't properly skilled in martial arts and has no formal knowledge of experienced hand-to-hand combat. His superhuman strength enable him to execute fighting moves with superhuman force at an opponent. Even in his human form he easily outmatch and threw Randy around like a rag doll in almost all of his appearances and interaction with him. Along with the aid of his superpowers and dark magic, Evil Julian is much more powerful to throw Randy around and cause him serious injury in one blow. In the final he was able to lure both Howard and Randy into a portal to the [[Land of Shadows]] with the aid of his monster minion. In the final battle he held for a brief time until he was defeated by both Randy (who finally stopped holding back) and The Sorcerer.\n\n==History==\nEvil Julian first appeared in the episode \"[[Julian's Birthday Surprise]]\", when [[Randy Cunningham]] brought along a Chaos Pearl to Julian's magic-themed birthday party at the Magic Funporium. Believing it to be a birthday gift, Julian got a hold of the pearl and ended up unleashing its power. Going crazy, Julian opened a portal to the [[Land of Shadows]], and the unearthly creatures residing within emerged from it. Randy used his scarf to knock the pearl from Julian's hand, but the creatures grabbed a hold of him and started dragging him into the vortex. Randy told [[Howard Weinerman|Howard]] to get the pearl but to use the bag to avoid touching it. Howard used the Ninja-for-the-Chaos Pearl trading deal, and the creatures released Randy at Julian's command. Howard threw the bag, and the creatures went after it. Julian went after the bag when Randy tossed it into the vortex. Randy wrapped his scarf around Julian's leg as Julian and the creatures grasped the bag. During the tug-of-war, an alternate version of Julian appeared, still clutching the bag. Evil Julian ended up trapped in the Land of Shadows while the real Julian was pulled to safety. When Evil Julian opened the bag, he found that Howard had swapped the pearl with a gargoyle's head, and let out an anguished scream of agony.\n\nEvil Julian later returned in the episode \"[[Snow-Klahoma!]]\" He managed to swap places with the real Julian, trapping him in the Land of Shadows.\n\nEvil Julian reappears in \"[[Mastermind of Disastermind]]\", speaking to the real Julian through a bathroom mirror and asking him where he may find the power ball. When the real Julian can't provide any help he tries to flag down Randy, eventually turning to Howard to find out where Randy is. Randy's subsequent prank war with Howard leads to him trying to do the unexpected by giving Evil Julian the power ball. Evil Julian later attacks Randy and reveals that he's really Julian's evil counterpart. Evil Julian tries to fight off Randy, eventually combining himself with one of Viceroy's robots and the power ball. Randy seemingly defeats him by tossing him in the air and exploding him, but the end of the episode reveals that he's crash-landed, still alive, and in a new cyborg form.\n\nLater, Evil Cyborg Julian reappears, disguised in a cloak. He harasses a shop keeper who sold Howard a \"Wishing idol\" (actually a regular porcelain cat statue with a power ball inside) and then goes after Howard. He steps in front of the school bus Randy and Howard are in, still disguised until Randy masks himself and asks who he's fighting. Evil cyborg Julian tries to attack Howard and steal the idol as Howard keeps wishing on it to try and keep Randy from losing the fight. Howard and Randy run and hide in the shop Howard bought the idol at, at which point Howard drops the idol and they discover it's a power ball. Randy goes out to fight Julian and nearly loses before Howard keeps Evil Julian at bay by using up the power ball's wish magic, which results in several dozen crates and a truck ramming into Evil Julian. He escapes at the end of the fight after being inadvertently injured by nearly all of Howard's wishes.\n\nIn part one of the finale episode, its been discovered that the empty power ball Randy and Howard discarded still had a drop of evil juice in it, which falls into the sewer and contaminates the city's water supply. Nearly everyone in the city (save for Randy and Howard) becomes a controlled puppet, which Evil Julian uses to try and dig for the other power balls. Randy and Howard gather the other two they've found, only to be surrounded by the rest of the city's possessed residents and Evil Julian. Evil Julian tries to get the possessed crowd to take Howard's power ball, at which point Randy discovers he can also use the ball he's holding to control the crowd as well as fight back. Evil Julian decides to go for Randy instead, resulting in both of them falling down a pit and trying to keep each other at bay. Randy gains the upper hand and gets Evil Julian pinned to the wall, but becomes obsessed with the orb's power in the process. Evil Julian gets blasted out of the pit, and when Randy emerges he attempts to deal a finishing blow to Evil Julian, accidentally hitting Howard. Randy snaps out of his power craze, and while Howard recovers quickly he becomes possessed when he drinks from a canteen of contaminated water. Evil Julian tries to fight off Randy, meanwhile controlling Howard to get him to walk off the edge and into the pit to fall to his death. Randy saves Howard instead of protecting the orbs, enabling Evil Julian to fuse with the other two orbs, officially giving him the power of three orbs. After getting three he calls the final orb energy (which was in everyone in Norrisville) to him, giving him the power of all four balls. He brags about being able to destroy their world before escaping to gather more power still.\n\nRandy later finds Evil Julian inside Mt. Chuck, gathering energy and releasing monsters from the Land of Shadows. Randy makes an entrance and waits for Howard to show up while he fights with Evil Julian. Evil Julian sicks a monster from the Land of Shadows at Randy, still trying to gather power. When Howard shows up Evil Julian attempts to blast them with evil energy, though they eventually get sucked into the portal, at which point Evil Julian assumes they've led themselves to their own doom.\n\nEvil Julian goes to the [[Norrisville High|school]] and absorbs the power [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]] had released to cause chaos and create stanked students, draining The Sorcerer of all his power. He imprisons [[Willem Viceroy]] and [[Hannibal McFist]] (along with several students) after they show up to try and catch the ninja, apparently having told McFist he didn't need his help. Randy shows up to the demolished school and starts to fight Evil Julian, but is losing by a considerable amount. He releases The Sorcerer due to the [[NinjaNomicon]]'s instructions. Evil Julian insists that the Sorcerer is far too weak to fight him, though when he attacks The Sorcerer, the latter absorbs his energy into the empty balls around his waist and defeats Evil Julian. Evil Julian's cyborg parts fall off and he returns to his human-like and more Julian-like form. He stays off to the side while Randy fights The Sorcerer. Howard and the real Julian fall from a portal and once The Sorcerer is defeated Julian and Evil Julian slide towards each other involuntarily, causing Evil Julian to tell real Julian to stay away as they reform into the same being, obviously very displeased.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Evil Julian appears on the season 2 poster, holding a pearl with Randy and Howard inside while grinning maliciously.\n*Evil Julian and the Sorcerer are similar, both losing their normal selves to the Land of Shadows due to weak will and becoming evil, chaotic beings.\n*Some fans refer to him as \"Ghoulian\".\n*He might be an alternate personality or subconsciousness of Julian.\n*Like [[NomiRandy]], His voice actor [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as an evil counterparts of Julian, [[Ben Schwartz]] as an evil counterparts of [[Randy Cunningham]].\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
