He is the evil scientist but rather refined madman responsible for all of the bizarre robots attacking [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]]. As McFist's chief mad scientist, Viceroy doesn\u2019t really care about money or power; he just wants everyone to appreciate his genius.\n\n==Personality==\nVery dry-humored and sarcastic, as well as refined and somewhat effeminate, Viceroy works hard to create deadly robots and monsters to destroy the Ninja. He gets frustrated that McFist usually claims the creations or schemes were his idea or blames him for something that was actually McFist's fault. When Viceroy attended Mad Scientist University, he managed to get fellow rival [[Jerry Driscoll]] caught for making a doomsday device in order to become valedictorian and get attention.\n\nIn the episode, \"[[Monster Dump]]\", it's revealed that Viceroy has a pet amoeba named \"Nicholas\". He went down into the volcano to get him, showing that he cares very much about his pet. When falling into the volcano, he activated an inflatable lab coat which he was wearing on his regular one, saving him from injury. When Randy rescued Nicholas, Viceroy promised to take a vacation from helping McFist destroy the Norrisville Ninja. He was seen at the end of the episode in Provence, riding his scooter with Nicholas.\n\n==Appearance==\nViceroy is tall and thin, having dark brown hair with a gray streak, a beard, and gray eyes. He wears a lavender lab coat over a purple shirt and lavender ascot, purple pants, glasses with purple rims, and black shoes.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Hannibal McFist]]===\nMcFist is Viceroy's boss, but he usually takes Viceroy's plans and successes as his own, while blaming Viceroy for the failures of both. Although Hannibal McFist upsets him continually, Viceroy is surprisingly loyal to his boss and their mission.\nViceroy dislikes when McFist is yelling constantly or in a rage, often taking it smoothly but not afraid to leave or ask him to calm down. When Viceroy proved to have an able robot in \"[[Viva El Nomicon]]\", he asked for an apology, but McFist had one of his robots do it In \"[[Weinerman Up]]\", once the Ninja was consumed, both hugged each other, then hopped around in excitement, laughing happily. When McFist is disappointed that they didn't get to use the doomsday machine on anything, Viceroy suggests to blow up the McBoomYum Factory in \"[[Night of the Living McFizzles]]\". He sometimes sees McFist as a friend, and vice versa, but in general they don't get along much. In \"Grave Puncher: The Movie!,\" upon preparing to watch the movie, Viceroy placed his leg next to Hannibal's touching it, and Hannibal moved his leg away quickly, stating that he does not like it.\n\n===[[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|The Sorcerer]]===\nAlong with McFist, Viceroy is scared of the Sorcerer, freaking out from the sound of the phone ringing after a meeting with him in \"Last Stall on the Left.\" During \"[[Bash Johnson: 11th Grade Ninja]]\", he isn't able to see the Ninja's identity because of the Robo-Apes in front. He also likes seeing the Sorcerer fail for once when the stanked robot is destroyed in \"[[The Ninja Supremacy]]\".\n\n===[[Randy Cunningham]]/Norrisville Ninja===\nViceroy has never met Randy except as the Ninja, and the closest thing to their interactiing is in \"[[Weinerman Tested, Cunningham Approved]]\", when Randy and Viceroy briefly talk about Howard breaking McPeepers, and later when Randy returns to find Howard.\nHowever, Viceroy has dealt with the Ninja many times, sending out many robots to destroy him. No matter how hard he tries, whether to defeat him or find his identity, Viceroy can't beat the Ninja, although he comes close to success many times. On some occasions, the two have actually helped each other. In \"Monster Dump,\" Randy saves Nicholas, much to Viceroy's relief, and in return, Viceroy takes a two-week vacation to take a break from trying to kill him. Once Jerry Driscoll is brought back to like in \"[[Dawn of the Driscoll]]\", Randy seeks out Viceroy's help to find Jerry's location and stop the doomsday device.\n\n===[[Howard Weinerman]]===\nCapturing Howard for saying he knew the Ninja's identity in \"[[Gossip Boy]]\", McFist at first plans to torture him until Viceroy says he has a mind reader that no one ever asked him about. However, once Howard proved to know nothing, they returned him. In \"Dawn of the Driscoll,\" Howard dressed up like him, remarking, \"Viceroy has style,\" much to Randy's chagrin. Mistaking Howard for his old rival, Mr. Driscoll kidnapped Howard and took him to where his doomsday device was hidden. When he spotted Howard's costume while about to stop the machine, Viceroy was very impressed and pleased, though he is less so when Howard suggests merely unplugging the nuclear-powered doomsday device. In \"[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]\", he and Howard interact throughout the entire episode as they try to fix the roller coaster. He considers Howard the most destructive force he's ever seen in \"Weinerman Tested, Cunningham Approved\".\n\n===[[Jerry Driscoll]]===\nViceroy got Jerry arrested for building the doomsday device so that he could be valedictorian at Evil Scientist University. Years later, Jerry mistook Howard as Viceroy and kidnapped him, wanting him to have a front row seat at his plan. Viceroy knows where Jerry would be, so he helps the Ninja and Mrs. Driscoll find him in \"Dawn of the Driscoll\".\n\n===[[Nicholas (Randy Cunningham)|Nicholas]]===\nFinding one of the blobs he made on his shoes, Viceroy quickly came to care about it and named it \"Nicholas\" in \"[[Monster Dump]]\". When Gene Levine comes back and takes Nicholas to Mt. Chuck, Viceroy is horrified and tries to save him, even going into the volcano to find him. He asks Randy to rescue him from the lava, and in turn, takes a vacation from destroying the Ninja with Nicholas.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original pilot, Viceroy was much more intimidated by the Judge (the first concept for the show's antagonist, preceding Hannibal McFist), rather than sarcastically undercutting the villain.\n*An original design of Otto can be seen drawn one of the blackboards of The Gifted and Talented Classroom of Norrisville High, implying that Viceroy attended the high school.\n*In [[Jhonen Vasquez]]'s concept for him, he stated he was based off Richerd Ayoade's moss from the IT crowd.\n*Viceroy's signature design is giving his inventions secret arms, as McFist states in \"[[Last Stall on the Left]]\".\n*He apparently understands his creations because he had a conversation with Krackenstein in \"Last Stall on the Left\" as well as with Stewart the Robo-Lizard in \"[[House of 1,000 Boogers]]\".\n*He enjoys going to Whoopee World, as seen in \"[[Viva El Nomicon]]\".\n*He has only one day off granted throughout the year, as stated in \"[[Monster Drill]]\". This may or may not include the company trip to Whoopee World, as seen in \"Viva El Nomicon\".\n*He has a pet (giant) amoeba named Nicholas in \"Monster Dump\", to whom he is very protective and fatherly.\n*He is considered by Howard to have style, as stated in \"Dawn of the Driscoll.\"\n*He is acquainted with Mrs. Driscoll and turned in her husband Jerry Driscoll for planning to destroy the world.\n*He has an unnamed mother whom he mentions in \"Gossip Boy,\" and it is possible that her picture is the one seen in the background in his home in \"Dawn of the Driscoll\".\n*He watches the classic television Halloween special episode of Peanuts in \"Dawn of the Driscoll\". When he is eating popcorn, he said \"Stupid kid sitting in a pumpkin patch all night. Everyone knows there's no such thing as the Great...[Pumpkin].\"\n*He was wearing reindeer antlers and a red nose for McFist's Christmas party in \"[[Silent Punch, Deadly Punch]]\". This is an obvious reference to Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\n*Willem is voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, who also voiced [[Antauri]] from \"[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]\".\n*He is banned from Whoopee World, due to Randy's neutralizing the Mexican Death Bear.\n**However in \"[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]\", he is able to go to Whoopee World.\n*He befriends Howard in \"Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes.\"\n**However, he appears to not remember who Howard is after every episode.\n*Viceroy's biggest fear is his childhood nemesis, Stevie Miller.\n*In \"[[Monster Drill]],\" he was reading a book with a title parodying ''Love Never Dies''.\n*He had never met or interacted with Randy outside the suit until \"[[Weinerman Tested, Cunningham Approved]]\".\n*According to the show's official Tumblr, Viceroy has his own apartment, but also a room at McFist's mansion for when they're working on long projects.\n*Psycho-Bot learned smugness from Viceroy.\n*Viceroy says that he hates the outdoors in \"[[Best Buds]]\".\n*In \"[[Otto Know Better]]\", Viceroy explains that the one thing that keeps him rational is his robot pet, Otto.\n*Despite being one of the three main villains of the series, Viceroy has only appeared in 64 of the 100 episodes, only appearing without McFist once.\n*It's confirmed by the show's Tumblr that Viceroy's father is no longer alive.\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Viceroy, Willem}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
