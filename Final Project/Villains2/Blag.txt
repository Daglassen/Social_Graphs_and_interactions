Under\u00a0Kazar's orders, Blag manages to capture [[Ryan]], while the other wildebeests push [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]]\u00a0off a cliff (but he survives). Near the end of the film, when Kazar\u00a0orders his henchmen to finish Samson and Ryan off, Blag\u00a0defies Kazar by saying that he and the other wildebeests are tired of pretending to be something they're not. Kazar is then left to\u00a0perish inside the volcano while\u00a0Blag, the other wildebeests, and the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]] animals escape. Blag is last seen on the boat\u00a0where he begins a dance off, to which all the animals join in.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\">\nWildebeest-is-falling-down-coloring-page.jpg\nLarryandbridgetmeetblagandkazar wkeyr.jpg\nKazar-and-blag-are-running-coloring-page.jpg\nBlag-kazar-and-nigel-coloring-page.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Wild}}\n[[Category:The Wild characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Wildebeests]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]"
