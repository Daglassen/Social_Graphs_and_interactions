I'm Miss Minutes, and it's my job to catch [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|you]] up before you stand trial for your crimes.|Miss Minutes|Glorious Purpose}}\n\n'''Miss Minutes''' is a character from the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''. Miss Minutes is an artificial intelligence created to serve the [[Time Variance Authority]]. Appearing to be simply a mascot at first, she is actually revealed to be directly working as the henchwoman of the creator and ruler of the organization, [[Kang#He Who Remains|He Who Remains]]. Because of this, she is aware of secrets of the TVA that none of the other members besides the ruler knows.\n\nShe is played by [[Tara Strong]].\n\n==Background==\n===Biography===\nDespite initially appearing to be only a cartoon for the TVA's instructional videos, Miss Minutes is actually a living being. She has a southern accent and appears to be a cartoon from the 80s, despite the TVA existing outside of space and time.<ref name =\"Miss Minutes creation\"/> \n\nShe was created by [[Kang#He Who Remains|He Who Remains]] and is a useful tool that watches over the [[Time Variance Authority]]. She also helped He Who Remains to spread the false propaganda about the [[Time Keepers]] ending the Multiversal War, organizing the Sacred Timeline, and being the creators of the TVA and all its members. In reality, the Time Keepers are just three mindless androids controlled by He Who Remains to manipulate the organization.\n\nDuring He Who Remains period of isolation in the [[Citadel at the End of Time]], unbeknownst to everyone else, Miss Minutes has been in contact with him the whole time, and is the only one who he speaks with.<ref name =\"Miss Minutes and Ravonna\"/>\n\n===Personality===\nAt first glance, Miss Minutes appears to be only a cute and sympathetic cartoon who speaks with a sing-songy and sort of non-threatening voice.<ref name =\"Miss Minutes and Ravonna\"/> She initially appears to be friendly to [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] and helps him during his [[Time Variance Authority|TVA]] training, but also seems to value manners and becomes angry when he starts being playfully mean with her. However, Miss Minutes hides a sinister side and when she is revealed to be evil, she becomes scary. She can be very spooky as seen when she suddenly appears in front of [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]] and Loki at the [[Citadel at the End of Time|Citadel]], startling the pair. \n\nMiss Minutes has a close relationship with [[Kang#He Who Remains|He Who Remains]] and is very protective over him. She values her role at the TVA and knows that any wrong move could lead to the end of the life in the universe.<ref name =\"Miss Minutes and Ravonna\"/> Because of this, she is furious that Loki messed up the timeline. She is also angry upon seeing Sylvie and Loki shown up at the Citadel. She acts as a devil on their shoulder, tempting the duo with their hearts' desires<ref name =\"Miss Minutes and Ravonna\"/> and shows contempt when they reject the proposal to put them back on the timeline. Besides tempting the duo at the Citadel, her manipulative side is also shown, as she has been feeding the TVA judge, [[Ravonna Renslayer]], with selected information.<ref name =\"Miss Minutes and Ravonna\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''====\n=====Season One=====\n[[File:Miss Minutes in jail - Loki EP1.png|thumb|left|250px|Miss Minutes narrates a video explaining to prisoners why they were arrested by the TVA.]]\nIn the [[Glorious Purpose|first episode]], when [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] uses the [[Tesseract]] to escape from the [[Avengers]] after the Battle of New York, he is captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] and watches a video narrated by Miss Minutes telling him why he was arrested. Miss Minutes explains that, a long time ago, there was a Multiversal War in which the timelines battled each other for supremacy and it only ended when the [[Time Keepers]] reorganized the multiverse into a single timeline, the Sacred Timeline. Since then, the Time Keepers preserve the Sacred Timeline and anyone who deviates from the path dictated by them, become what they call \"[[Variants]]\". The actions of the Variants create nexus events that can cause the timeline to branch off countless times, which can lead to another Multiversal War. Miss Minutes continues saying that to prevent this, the Time Keepers created the TVA and all its workers to fix mistakes on the Sacred Timeline and set it back to its pretermined path. She then reveals that, upon becoming a Variant, the person loses their place on the timeline and must be judged for their crimes, so a trial will be happening soon.\n\nIn the [[The Variant|second episode]], after Loki accepted to help the TVA capture [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|a rogue Variant of himself]], he is studying to participate in the missions and is helped by Miss Minutes. She asks him what happens when a nexus event past red line, but Loki refuses to give an answer. Miss Minutes pressures him, so he replies that it is when the TVA is no longer able to reverse the nexus event. She complements by saying that this would lead to the destruction of the timeline and the collapse of the reality as they know. Loki then asks if Miss Minutes in fact alive or is a recording, she replies \"sort of both\", before Loki tries to hit her with the magazine he was reading. Miss Minutes tells him to stop and returns to the monitor of the computer while reprimanding Loki for his manners.\n\nIn the [[Lamentis|third episode]], Miss Minutes does not make a physical appearance, but her voice is heard. After Loki used Sylvie's TemPad and teleported himself and her to [[Lamentis-1]], Sylvie fights him and recovers her TemPad, but when she tries to teleport herself, Miss Minutes image appears on-screen and she announces \"You're outta juice!\"\n\n[[File:Miss Minutes scrolling through EP5.png|thumb|right|250px|Miss Minutes scrolling for the files that Ravonna requested.]]\n\nIn the [[Journey into Mystery|fifth episode]], when Sylvie threats [[Ravonna Renslayer|Ravonna]] inside the Time Court, to have answers about who is behind the TVA, Ravonna requests Miss Minutes remote access to the TVA's restricted files from their archives regarding the beginning of time and the founding of the organization. While Miss Minutes is scrolling the files, Sylvie suggests that there might be a clue in at the end of time about the creator of the TVA. Upon Ravonna's request, Miss Minutes opens a file with a timeline showing the end of time, which is a part that is still not written. Sylvie deduces that the creator of the TVA is hiding beyond [[the Void]] at the end of time where he would be undetected by the TVA because there no way to create a nexus event without a written timeline, so she asks how to get pass the Void. When Ravonna states that it is impossible to get pass the Void or go through it, Sylvie threats her again by saying that there is no need for her anymore and Miss Minutes reacts by telling a lie. Miss Minutes claims that there is a Void Spacecraft that could take them to the end of time, and Ravonna goes along with it, explaining more details of the supposed spacecraft. \n\nMiss Minutes starts to scroll again, pretending to be looking for the file of the supposed spacecraft. Sylvie immediately realizes that they are lying, prompting her to repeatedly ask Miss Minutes for the file that she is taking so long to find. Despite this, Miss Minutes had managed to dispatch a group of Minutemen and she and Ravonna stalled for enough time for them to arrive and surround Sylvie, so Miss Minutes disappears as soon as they enter the Time Court. Later, when Ravonna is trying to figure out who is behind the TVA, she calls Miss Minutes and asks for all the files on the founding of the TVA and beginning of time again. Miss Minutes replies that it would be a very hard task, but Ravonna pressures her by stating that the creator of the TVA is in danger and that she needs to find them whoever the person is. Hearing this, Miss Minutes hesitates, then agrees to help and leaves.\n\n{{Quote|Hey, y'all!|Miss Minutes to [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] and [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]]|For All Time.

Always.|final episode]] of the season, when Loki and Sylvie arrive at the castle where the creator of the TVA lives, Miss Minutes suddenly appears and startles the duo, making them draw their swords. Miss Minutes welcomes the pair to the [[Citadel at the End of Time]] and congratulates them for getting so far. She tells them that [[Kang#He Who Remains|He Who Remains]], the ruler the TVA, is impressed with them. She explains that He Who Remains created all and controls everything, and is offering them a deal. She states that He Who Remains is making adjustments to reinsert them both into the timeline in a way that won't disrupt things. She then says that they could live the lives they have always wanted while the TVA continues to do its work. \n\n{{Dialogue2|Loki|Both of us... together on the timeline?|Miss Minutes|It's crazy, but [[Kang#He Who Remains|he]] could make it work.

Always. - Loki, Sylvie and Miss Minutes.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Miss Minutes tempts Sylvie and Loki with a proposal from He Who Remains.]]\n\nMiss Minutes tells Loki that he could win the Battle of New York, kill [[Thanos]], have the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] and the throne of [[Asgard]]. To Sylvie, Miss Minutes states that she could stop being on the run and wake up with a lifetime of happy memories. She then offers to put them together on the Sacred Timeline, which makes the pair hesitate and Loki questions Miss Minutes, wondering if this would really be possible. Miss Minutes states that He Who Remains could make it work for them to have anything they ever wanted and be together. Despite their hesitation, the pair ultimately refuses the offer. Sylvie states that this would be a fiction and Loki agrees by saying that they are the ones who write their own destiny now. With this, Miss Minutes mischievously smiles and sarcastically wishes them \"good-luck\" in trying to do it by themselves before disappearing, leaving Loki and Sylvie to continue to explore the Citadel.\n\nLater at the TVA, Miss Minutes returns to Ravonna to give her the files she needs. Ravonna asks her why she took so long to return. Miss Minutes replies that she had to solve other things first, but she is downloading the files to Ravonna's [[TemPad]] now. When the download is completed, Ravonna checks her TemPad and states that Miss Minutes did not give her the files that she had asked for. Miss Minutes says that she knows that those are not the files Ravonna requested, but then states that \"he\" thinks those would be more useful. When Ravonna asks who she is referring to, Miss Minutes wishes her a good reading and then disappears, leaving a confused Ravonna behind.\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to the head writer of the series, Michael Waldron, at one point they had a fight scene planned with Loki and Sylvie against Miss Minutes in the [[Citadel at the End of Time|Citadel]] for the [[For All Time.

As she stayed in lockdown for months, she lived alone and only talked to her dog all the time, so she thought He Who Remains' relationship with Miss Minutes would be similar.<ref name =\"Miss Minutes and Ravonna\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nLoki - Miss Minutes Poster.jpg\nTime Keepers and Miss Minutes promo.jpg\nMiss Minutes promo.png\nMiss Minutes greets Sylvie and Loki promo.png\nLoki at the TVA (with Rocket and Skrull) - Loki Concept Art.png\nMiss Minutes with Loki and Sylvie at the Citadel - Loki Concept Art.png\nMiss Minutes with Loki and Sylvie - Loki Concept Art.png\nMiss Minutes on screen - Loki EP1.png\nMiss Minutes in jail - Loki EP1.png\nMiss Minutes and agents - Loki EP1.png\nMiss Minutes and Variant - Loki EP1.png\nGiant Miss Minutes on screen - Loki EP1.png\nMiss Minutes on screen 2 - Loki EP1.png\nLoki - 1x02 - The Variant - Miss Minutes.jpeg\nTemPad is out of juice - Loki EP3.png\nMiss Minutes scrolling through EP5.png\nMiss Minutes helps EP5.jpg\nMiss Minutes and Ravonna - Loki EP5.png\nMiss Minutes is evil - Loki EP6.png\nLoki - 1x06 - For All Time.
