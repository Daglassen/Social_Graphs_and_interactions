She was cut after the rewrite because [[Linda Woolverton]] wanted to place more focus on Gaston as the main antagonist, especially his strained relationship with [[Belle]].\n\n==Background==\nMarguerite is the snobbish sister of [[Maurice]] from the [[Beauty and the Beast Original Screenplay|1989 screenplay for ''Beauty and the Beast'']]. She moves in with Maurice to help him out with taking care of Belle and [[Clarice (Beauty and the Beast)|Clarice]] (or at least, that's what she says). When Maurice loses his ships at sea, thereby losing his fortune, she along with the rest of the family have to move to [[Belle's Cottage|a small cottage]] in the country which she doesn't like one bit.\n\n==Role in the film==\nMarguerite is first seen in the alternate beginning pulling up to Maurice's mansion in a carriage laden with luggage as her family is playing in the yard. After telling her footman to unload her belongings around the back of the house, prodding the horse with her parasol to get it going and remarking \"idiot\" as the footman trips when the carriage starts moving, she saunters up to her brother and explains why she has come. A few days later, after the family has moved into the cottage, Maurice receives notice from two soldiers that his taxes are overdue and he will lose the house if he doesn't pay them. Marguerite remarks that she knew this would happen and suggests that to get money, Maurice should either sell his [[Belle's mother|late wife]]'s music box that Belle has just received for her birthday, or marry Belle off to someone rich. After Maurice leaves to do the former, Marguerite invites Gaston to come to tea so that he may attempt to persuade Belle to accept his previously rejected marriage proposal. Later, when Belle states to Gaston that she will need time to think about whether or not she will become his wife, she attempts to flatter him by complimenting him on his new wig and states that Belle is just shy and needs more time to think about it. As Gaston leaves, Marguerite asks him if he will back the next day, although he makes it seem as though it's unlikely. Marguerite is last shown telling her nieces that Maurice is getting what he deserves by being lost in the storm because he ran off and left them alone with her.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMargurite Final Sketch.JPG|Sketch of Marguerite's final character design\nMargurite Concept 2.JPG|Concept art of Marguerite by [[Andreas Deja]]\nMargurite Concept 1.JPG|Concept art of Marguerite by Andreas Deja]]\nMargurite Doodle (1).jpeg|A rough sketch of Marguerite by [[Mel Shaw]]\nMargurite Doodle (2).jpeg\nMargurite Concept 5.jpg|Concepts of various outfits for Marguerite\nMarguriteFinalConcept.jpg|Sketch of Marguerite's final character design by Andreas Deja\nMargurite Carriage.JPG|Marguerite arriving at Maurice's mansion\nClarice Marguerite (2).jpg|Marguerite surveying Clarice\nMaurice with Marguerite (1).jpg|Marguerite with Maurice\nClarice Marguerite.jpg|Marguerite attempting to butter up Gaston\nMarguerite Gaston (1).jpg|Complimenting Gaston on his wig\nMarguerite Arrives.jpg|Marguerite walks into Maurice's yard\nMarguerite Maurice Belle.jpg|Marguerite greeting Maurice and Belle\nMaurice with Marguerite (2).jpg|Being greeted by Maurice\nMarguerite's Disdain.jpg|Marguerite is shocked that she now has to live in a cottage\nMaurice with Marguerite (3).jpg|Marguerite tells Maurice he should sell the music box\nMarguerite Orson.jpg|Marguerite giving [[Philippe|Orson]] some water\nMaurice with Marguerite (4).jpg|As Maurice leaves to sell the music box, Marguerite asks him where he's going\nMarguerite Belle Clarice.jpg|Telling Belle that she should fix her hair in preparation for Gaston's visit\nMarguerite Gaston (3).jpg|Marguerite is upset that Gaston is leaving the cottage so soon\nMarguerite Nightgown.jpg|Marguerite in her nightgown\nClarice Marguerite (3).jpg|Marguerite is shocked when Charley gets caught under her dress\nMargueriteWithGaston (2).jpg|Watching [[Gaston]] check his complexion before going in to meet Belle\nMargueriteCrossingFingers.jpg|Marguerite crosses her fingers, hoping that Gaston's proposal will be successful\nMarguerite Smiling.jpg|Marguerite reminisces about how rich Gaston is\nMarguerite Spinning Belle.jpg|Spinning [[Belle]] into a chair in order to get her ready for Gaston's visit\nMarguerite Brushing Belle's Hair (1).jpg|\"Think about your father and Clarice...\"\nMarguerite Brushing Belle's Hair (2).jpg|\"...aren't they entitled to a better life?\"\nMarguerite Brushing Belle's Hair (3).jpg|\"And me...after all I've sacrificed for this family!\"\nMarguerite Brushing Belle's Hair (4).jpg\nMarguerite Fixing Belle's Hair.jpg\nMarguerite Gaston (4).jpg|\"May I have a word?\"\nMarguerite Gaston (5).jpg|\"My, but you look handsome today!\"\nMarguerite Talking to Gaston.jpg|\"Is that a new wig?\"\nMarguerite Gaston (6).jpg|\"The color suits you]!\"\nMarguerite Gaston (8).jpg|\"Has my niece given you an answer?\"\nMarguerite Gaston (7).jpg|\"She needs more time!\"\nMarguerite Gaston (9).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Marguerite was the closest characterization to [[Belle's Sisters|Belle's wicked sisters]] in the original tale. Incidentally, the [[1988]] draft actually featured them, but when it was rewritten for the [[1989]] on, they were replaced with and condensed into Marguerite.\n**Ironically, the name \"Marguerite\" was used for one of the wicked sisters in the ''Faerie Tale Theatre'' version of the story.\n*Had she been kept, she would have predated [[Scar]] as being the first [[Disney Villains|Disney Villain]] or at least antagonist to be a blood relative to the main protagonist, being Belle's aunt. She is also the second villain/antagonist to actually be considered to have blood ties to the main protagonist during development, after [[Ursula]] (who was initially considered to be [[King Triton]]'s sister and thus [[Ariel]]'s aunt), although unlike Ursula, Marguerite was cut from the film altogether.\n\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
