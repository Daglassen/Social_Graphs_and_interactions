Unfortunately for him, the second test not only failed barring moving the moon a few feet, but also caused the beam to completely shut down to the extent that the dish remained locked in place. This caused Benedict to turn on him in a fury, making very clear to Rosenthal that whatever he told him before, he did not care. Benedict then, when Rosenthal pleaded that he'll do better next time, relayed that he's going to have him detained for the failure by giving an analogy to a \"repeated troublemaker\", also having [[Kojak]] and an [[Secret Service Look-Alike Agents|Agent]] drag him off as he's begging for mercy, with Benedict promptly replacing him with his assistant.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Recess}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rosenthal}}\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Recess: School's Out]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Stub]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
