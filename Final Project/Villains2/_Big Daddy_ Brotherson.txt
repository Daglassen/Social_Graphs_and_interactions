He gave information to [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] on [[Duff Killigan]] in the episode \"Number One\" and [[Dr. Drakken]] on cybertronic technology in ''[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama]]''.\n\n==Personality==\nThough he can be very serious, \"Big Daddy\" Brotherson is best known for his childish side, which delights in playing silly games and basically teasing his clients until he is finally ready to make a deal. Anyone who refuses to play along is swiftly and roughly dismissed by his bodyguard.\n\n==Biography==\n\"Big Daddy\" Brotherson first encountered Team Possible at the black market, where they were searching for a lead in Professor Sylvan Green's kidnapping. Global Justice agent Will Du tried to force the information out of Brotherson and was immediately tossed through a window. Kim Possible was able to persuade Brotherson to give up the information with a chocolate bar.\n\nDr. Drakken approached Brotherson in an attempt to buy information on the cybertronic technology he needed for his latest plot. After several tries, Brotherson finally gave Drakken some very ironic news: that the only genuis to crack the secrets of cybertronics was Dr. James Possible, Drakken's former college friend and Kim's father\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Number One]]\"\n*\"[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama|So the Drama, Part 1]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBig-Daddy-Brotherson-Mugshot.png\nbdb.PNG\nbdb-guard.PNG\nbdb-kim.PNG\nbdb-std.PNG\nbdb-std3.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brotherson, Big Daddy}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]"
