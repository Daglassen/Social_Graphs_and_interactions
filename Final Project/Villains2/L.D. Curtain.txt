Curtain''' is the primary antagonist in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. He is the twin brother of the titular Benedict whose goal is to subliminally spread chaos and destruction among the populace.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nDr. Curtain is a very calm and studious person. He is easily impressed with the intelligence of children and seems fully supportive of the endeavors of the youth. However, he hides a sinister undertone that furthers his needs and wants. He does not anger easily, but still shows disappointment that borderlines on curiosity. He is also a very secretive person, even among those whom he trusts.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDr. Curtain resembles a much cleaned up version of his brother with straight short hair and neatly trimmed beard. He is usually dressed in a neat blue suit and vest.\n\n==Role in the [[The Mysterious Benedict Society|series]]==\nDr. L.D. Curtain was born as Nathaniel Benedict. As opposed to his more withdrawn brother, Nathaniel was very outgoing, optimistic and overachieving. He had a set of rules and plans for when he and Nicholas got adopted and held high aspirations. However, when a kindly couple came to adopt just one of them, they chose Nicholas over himself. Nevertheless, Nicholas promised Nathaniel that when he was settled, he would try to convince them to come back for him. This moment never came and Nathaniel grew up into a bitter adult; changing his name to L.D. Curtain.\n\nCurtain managed to achieve wealth and some slight fame; enough to create the Learning Institute for Veritas and Enlightenment, or the L.I.V.E. Institute. Locating his base on Harbor Island, he hired numerous loyal and willing employees to help with his goal of total unity, via the Whisperer, a machine capable of sending subliminal thought patterns into people's  heads. During this time, he had become aware of his brother's current status and attempted to kidnap him, but this failed and he had been trying to keep an eye on where he may have gone. He had also adopted a young boy by the name of Shepard Quaid, or S.Q. for short, from his deceased father, another scientist who was presumably under his employ.\n\nDr. Curtain later had acquired new students into the institute, Reynie Muldoon, Sticky Washington, Kate Wetherall and Constance Contraire. He suspected something about them was off and while he knew they were there for a purpose, kept his suspicions to a minimum. He had taken particular interest in Reynie and Sticky due to the two of them getting advancing grades faster than any other student at his school. He had them act as the transmitters to the Whisperer. While both were applicable, he found Sticky to be more accepting towards it and had favored him. Dr. Curtain began to enact his plan of universal thought, only to suspect the children of conspiring against him and made sure that nothing could impede what he called \"The Improvement\".\n\nEventually, things began to fall out of control and Dr. Curtain desperately tried to keep everything in order. Learning that his brother was nearby, he did everything he could to prevent him from foiling his plans. The children quickly arrived to stop him and discovered that just like Nicholas, he too had narcolepsy, but it affected him when angered, or as Reynie put it when he was \"vulnerable\". Dr. Curtain's machine was destroyed and he found himself confronted by Nicholas after all these years. The two of them had a bittersweet reunion, but Dr. Curtain was not interested in making amends and escaped with his assistant, Dr. Garrison and S.Q. feeling defeated, he perks up when Garrison hands him plans for another invention that was sure to be better than the Whisperer.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*In the original book series, '''Ledroptha Curtain''' (pronounced Le-drop-the) was prone to angry fits that would cause him to fall asleep. He also traveled in a wheelchair and wore shades to hide this.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMr. Curtain poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:Ledroptha Curtain|L.D.
