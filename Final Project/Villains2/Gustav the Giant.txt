He has brown sandals on his feet. He also has rotten teeth and a scraggly beard. He\u2019s obese and gigantic. \n\n\n==Appearances==\nGustav constantly terrorized a kingdom, unopposed. When Mickey Mouse, the tailor of the film's title, was ordered to slay him by the King ([[Minnie Mouse|Minnie Mouse's]] father), who mistakenly thought he killed seven giants in one blow, Mickey used his tailoring skills to defeat Gustav. He was last seen sleeping, his snoring powering the merry-go-round, which Mickey and Minnie were riding.\n\nOriginally unnamed in both the short and its comic adaptation in the ''Mickey Mouse'' newspaper comic strip, Gustav was given that name in the comic book story \"Thumper Meets the Seven Dwarfs\", originally printed as ''Four Color Comic'' #19. In the comic, when [[Doc]] is reading the story of \"The Giant and the Tailor\" to [[Thumper]], he suddenly shows up outside the [[Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs|cottage]] and abducts Thumper. He takes him to his castle, where he and his wife decide to keep him for a pet. He places him in his pet canary Klaus' birdcage as a new playmate for him. Fortunately, Doc and [[Dopey]] suddenly show up to save him and help him escape.<ref>[http://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2010/11/thumper-meets-seven-dwarfs-18-35.html Scans of Gustav's appearance in \"Thumper Meets the Seven Dwarfs\" at the Filmic Light blog's Snow White archive]</ref>\n\nGustav later appeared in one of the [[Walt Disney Fun-to-Read Library]] books, ''[[Mickey Meets the Giant]]''. He was attacking the village of Cedar Grove and Mickey has to use his wits to take him out like in the film. In the book, Mickey manages to defeat him by, in a test of strength, crushing a rock and have water come out of it (it was actually a meal sponge) causing the giant to flee in terror.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Several of Gustav's actions were reused for [[Willie the Giant]]'s movements.\n*Gustav makes a guest appearance in the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode \"[[Close Encounters of the Gummi Kind]]\", albeit as a woodsman at regular human size.\n*In the comics, his teeth look even more rotten than before. He probably doesn\u2019t brush his teeth.\n*His favourite food is blueberry pie, especially his wife\u2019s recipe.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGustav Giant.jpg\nGustav.jpg\nBrave little tailor 14large.png\nBrave little tailor 15large.png\nBrave little tailor 10large.jpg\nBrave little tailor 11large.jpg\nMickey threatening giant with scissors.jpg\n12large-2.jpg\nGiantdefeat.jpg|Gustav's defeat\nGiant.jpg\nCskid83.jpg\nOaioxde88.jpg\nGustavcameoingummiebears.jpg|Gustav's cameo in ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.\nBRAVE LITTLE TAILOR.png\nTumblr nd9gybc6DG1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nThmdwrfs34 35.jpg\nThmdwrfs33.jpg\nThmdwrfs20.jpg\nThmdwrfs19.jpg\nThmdwrfs18.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
