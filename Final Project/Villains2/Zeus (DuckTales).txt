He is the Greek god of lightning with a vendetta against [[Scrooge McDuck]].\n==Background==\nZeus was the ruler of [[Ithaquack]] and the Greek pantheon. He cherished the praise he was given to by the mortals. One day, Ithaquack was visited by the McDucks years ago, and Zeus invited them to the island's festivities. However, Scrooge McDuck was good at almost every game he was challenged against, and beat Zeus every time. When the mortals started praising the McDucks for their entertainment, Zeus banished the McDucks. He also brought forth thunderstorms to cast out the other gods and mortals of the island when they complained against Zeus for banishing Scrooge.\n\n==Role in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|series]]==\nIn the episode \"[[The Spear of Selene!]],\" when the McDucks crashland onto Ithaquack once again, Zeus confronts Scrooge; not wanting any trouble, Scrooge convinces him to let the McDucks stay for a while to enjoy the island. Zeus agrees at first, but later proposes a competition to liven up the place, trapping the McDucks in to force them to play. Choosing his son Storkules to represent the Greek Gods, Zeus challenges the McDucks to a series of trials. In a twist of irony however, [[Donald Duck]] and Scrooge's grand-nephews [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Louie]] still win every round, increasing Zeus' anger.\n\nIn the final round, Zeus challenges them to get the Golden fleece off a little girl names Ligeia. Storkules' nobility impedes him from doing so, prompting Zeus to have Ligeia (who is a siren) sing a song to control Storkules and has him target Scrooge's nephews. During the fight, Louie convinces Ligeia to give him the fleece, and Storkules rejoices in getting freed from the mind control. Seeing the impact their feud has on their relatives, Scrooge asks Zeus to let bygones be bygones; however, Zeus still demands one victory. To Scrooge's disgruntlement, he agrees to have one more round with Zeus - a ball-throwing competition- which he purposefully loses. Zeus is thrilled and boasts about his victory until Dewey accidentally drops a sphere that knocks Zeus' ball out, incurring Zeus' wrath. The McDucks quickly leave as the thunder god summons a storm after them.\n\nZeus is mentioned in \"[[Storkules in Duckburg!]]\", having grown weary of his son's lute playing and thus unleashed a hail of harpies on Storkcules, causing chaos in Maceduckia. Furthermore, as punishment for Storkcules' childish behavior, he banished his son from Ithaquack until he could mature, prompting Storkcules to journey to Duckburg to seek the counsel of Donald Duck.\n\nZeus returns in \"[[The Golden Spear!]]\", angered at Dewey for gaining divine status by possessing Hermes' winged sandals and travels to [[Duckburg]] to declare war on him. They fight each other to as stalemate before an exhausted Zeus departs, pridefully declaring himself the victor.\n\nIn \"[[Moonvasion!]]\", Zeus closes off Ithaquack and refuses to get involved in the battle against the Moonlanders as he doesn't want to help Scrooge, which also includes zapping Storkules when he pleaded to his father to let him help. Eventually, this causes for Selene and Storkules to turn against him, and he is last seen tied-up, enabling the two to assist Scrooge and his family at the very end in thwarting [[General Lunaris]]' plot, defeating Lunaris once and for all.\n\nIn \"[[New Gods on the Block!]]\", he has his God-like powers removed (via his headpiece) at the behest of the other Greek Gods because they've had enough of his bad attitude. Unwilling to give it up, Zeus spends the whole episode trying to reclaim the headpiece. After an attempt at getting help from his brother [[Hades]] fails, he has Storkules release a Titan (under the pretense to help out Donald and his girlfriend [[Daisy Duck]] when Storkules unintentionally caused a rift between them) so that he can vanquish it and be seen as worthy of regaining his power, only to fail miserably. Despite that ,Zeus does get his headpiece back, but as he's bragging, he falls into the rift that was caused by the Titan's release and ends up in the Underworld, where Hades mocks him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Zeus was initially proposed to be a swan for the show as a reference to the myth {{WikipediaLink|Leda and the Swan}} but the idea was turned down for being deemed 'gross'.<ref>{{Cite web|website=Tumblr|url=https://suspendersofdisbelief.tumblr.com/post/173628402146/so-glad-ducktales-is-finally-back-on-tv-the-spear|date=May 5, 2018|title=Frank Angones post}}</ref>\n*Zeus has elements based on the Disney versions of the same god - Jupiter from ''[[Trombone Trouble]]'' and [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] from ''[[Hercules]]''.\n*Zeus can be known as a foil to [[Scrooge McDuck]] as they both are good at everything and can be very stubborn and prideful. Zeus seems to be a representation of what Scrooge would become if he'd never get over his jealousy.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAdventures in Duckburg (2).png|Zeus\nThe Spear of Selene! 2.png\nDuckburg_map.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Zeus}}\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
