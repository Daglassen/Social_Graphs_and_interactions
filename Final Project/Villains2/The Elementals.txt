"[[File:Elementals.png|thumb]]\n'''The Elementals''' are [[Marvel Comics]] characters who appear in\u00a0''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''. They are based on the [[Marvel Comics]] characters of the same name. They are cybernetic monsters created by the evil genius [[Mysterio]] to help him further his schemes, each embodying one of the four elements of nature, hence their name. The four are created to appear as if they have complete control over fire, lava and magma, water,\u00a0sand, air and wind, respectively.\n\nThe Elementals were created by Tony Isabella & Val Mayerik.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''====\n\n[[Sandman]] appears in the opening of the film, when [[Nick Fury]] ([[Talos]] in disguise) and [[Maria Hill]] ([[Soren]] in disguise) come across it in Mexico. Mysterio then appears and \"defeats\" it.  All four appear in a hologram in a hologram when Nick Fury/Talos, Maria Hill/Soren, Spider-Man and Mysterio are discussing the threat (fake threat for the latter), Spider-Man and Mysterio fight [[Molten Man]] at a street fair, and [[Hydro-Man]] ambushes Peter Parker and [[Ned Leeds|his]] [[MJ|class]][[Betty Brant|mates]] at Venice\u2019s Grand Canal. All four are used by Mysterio to attack London Bridge at the end of the film, before disintegrating (or dispersing into the canal in the Water Elemental\u2019s case) when Peter Parker destroys the glasses Mysterio was using to control them\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Elementals are modelled after the [[Marvel Comics]] villains, Cyclone, [[Sandman]], [[Molten Man]], and [[Hydro-Man]], but are named after an obscure group composed of four interdimensional beings who claim to be the originators of said elements. While the advertisements names the Elementals as the listed villains, they are not named so in the film and are simply referred to as Air, Earth, Fire and Water by Mysterio himself. As a matter of fact, they have more in common with the [[Fantastic Four (team)|Fantastic Four]] villains the Elementals of Doom, who were constructs created by Diablo and even formed into a giant amalgamated being at one point.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSpider-Man Far From Home (30).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elementals}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
