He later tries to kill Sherlock, but ultimately fails.\n\n===Personality===\nToynbee is incompetent, blurting out [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] name when [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald]] wondered who would be behind stealing the Tower's key. However, he is also sly, being able to enter Sir Reginald's home without anyone, other than [[Sparky (Goof Troop)|Sparky]], noticing; nonetheless, he is quite daft when it comes to larger tasks, such as asassinating [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]].\n\n===Physical appearance===\nToynbee is a short, overweight anthropomorphic dog with black hair. He wears a blue jacket, a light blue collared shirt, gray pants, black shoes, and a dark blue newsboy cap. When burglaring, he also wears a black mask around his eyes.\n\n===Role in the series===\nHis only appearance is in the episode, \"[[Sherlock Goof]]\". He initally is tasked with stealing the Tower of London's key by [[Pete|Professor Inferiority]], but after he fails to do so, he is then helped by another of the Professor's henchmen to kill [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]], and also fails.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jim Cummings voices Toynbee with an impression of [[Andy Devine]], just as he does for [[Herb and Binkie Muddlefoot|Herb Muddlefoot]] in ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]] \n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"
