He appears to be very smart because he helped Jessie and Zuri find\u00a0Christina Ross's tiara. It appears that Zeus does not like Mrs. Chesterfield like everyone else.\n\nZeus is extremely devoted to his owner mainly because she practically forces him to, for example he watches television shows such as \"''The Real Housewives of New York''\" with her. Initially, Zeus was hostile toward\u00a0Ravi's pet monitor lizard,\u00a0Mr. Kipling. However, when a hawk tried to carry Zeus away to eat him, Mrs Kipling saved his life by swatting the bird away with his tail.\n\nThough he is loyal to Chesterfield, he switched her hair gel with super stick glue. This caused many problems including, Rhoda's hands getting stuck to her head, Jessie's arm getting stuck to Chesterfield's, and Jessie not trusting the kids. When it was revealed that Zeus was the real culprit, Rhoda said it was a mere mishap, since Zeus always gets her beauty products for her.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Jessie characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
