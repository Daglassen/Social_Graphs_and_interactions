He first appeared as the secondary antagonist of ''Star Wars: Attack of the Clones''.\n\nJango is a [[Mandalorian]] assassin and mercenary who was hailed far and wide as the galaxy's most ruthless and efficient bounty hunter. Coming under the employment of [[Count Dooku]], actually the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, Jango relocated himself to distant world of Kamino where his DNA was used in the production of the [[Clone Troopers]]. During the Battle of [[Geonosis]], Jango met his end at the hands of the Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]]. Jango's son, [[Boba Fett|Boba]] would go on to carry on his legacy by succeeding his father as the galaxy's greatest bounty hunter.\n\n==Background==\nJango Fett was born on Concord Dawn, a planet in the Outer Rim that was settled upon by Mandalorian colonists. Orphaned at a young age, who was eventually discovered by a group of Mandalorian warriors. Obeying the creed of Mandalore, which states that orphaned or lost children found by Mandalorians must be taken in and trained as foundlings, the warriors took Jango in and raised him as one of their own. After coming of age and swearing the creed, Jango was officially excepted as a Mandalorian warrior. He would eventually journey to Mandalore itself, in order to fight in the Mandalorian Civil Wars, a series of conflicts on the planet waged between the rival Mandalorian houses and clans. After the wars however, the New Mandalorians came to power, led by the new Ducthess Satine Kryze. Seeking to reform Mandalore into a pacifist society, the New Mandalorians exiled the planet\u2019s warriors, Jango being among them. This caused Jango to become a member of the Old Mandalorians, Mandalorian warriors who excepted their exile (unlike Death Watch who sought revenge against the New Mandalorians) and preserved their militaristic heritage by traveling the galaxy as bounty hunters and mercenaries. Though Jango was one of the Old Mandalorians, he did not associate himself with any of their different factions.\n\nBecoming a gun for hire, Jango Fett built himself a fearsome reputation throughout the galaxy as the best bounty hunter in the universe, due to the sheer level of his ruthlessness, cunning, and effectiveness. This eventually caught the attention of the Sith Order who considered him to be a fine specimen for their plans to build a clone army for the upcoming Clone Wars. After being contacted and hired by Darth Tyrannus, the Sith identity of the former Jedi Count Dooku, Jango agreed to being the Clone Army\u2019s donor. Beside his payment however, Jango also wanted one unaltered clone for himself, intending to raise it as a son. His request was granted and he named his \u201cson\u201d Boba Fett. Not only did he raise Boba but also taught him the combat skills he learned from the Mandalorians, though with no intention of making his son a Mandalorian.\n\n==Personality==\nOwning up to his reputation as the galaxy's most lethal bounty hunter, Jango Fett was a ruthless, cold, determined, cunning, amoral, and calculating mercenary. Befitting of a soldier and assassin for hire, his loyalty often lied with those who offered the greatest reward, staying in their service so long as they played his demanded fee. Known and feared throughout space for his efficiency in hunting down targets, Fett was a cunning and extremely calculating hunter. Rather than simply rushing into battle, Jango would gather sufficient intel on his targets, studying them in order to ascertain their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the perfect time to make his move. When on assignments, Jango would maintain and calm and cool demeanor, preferring to eliminate or capture his targets as quickly and effectively as possible. Due to his profession, Jango was loner, possessing few civil associations with others and next to no friendships. Though he was a member of the Old Mandalorians, Jango never affiliated himself with any of their clans or houses, preferring to work alone as a mercenary, further showing his independence. Despite this loner life-style, Jango was willing to work with other bounty hunters when he felt he needed too. Despite showing some camaraderie and concern for the safety of these partners however, Jango was not above turning on them, as he executed his partner Zam Wesell in order to ensure that she wouldn\u2019t sell him out to the Jedi. This further shows Jango\u2019s ruthless form of pragmatism and caution when on assignments. He did however, feel some remorse for having to go to such lengths, showing that he was not completely devoid of emotion or empathy.\n\nContrary of his loner attitude, deep down Jango longed for a familial connection, possibly implying a hidden sense of loneliness in his life. When providing his DNA to the Kaminoans for their clone army, Jango saw this as a chance to finally obtain the family bond he sought. This is what caused him to demand the production of an unaltered clone, as he wanted to raise the clone as his son. As Boba\u2019s father, Jango was kind and loving but also strict parent. He held high expectations for Boba, teaching him martial arts, how to use a blaster, various alien languages, and Mandalorian fighting techniques, all in order to toughen his son and instill in him a sense of ruthlessness as well, seeing the universe as a dangerous place that he had to be ready for. Despite his parental feelings towards Boba, Jango held no affections for his other, genetically modified, clones, seeing their production as no different from any other job he had been given. This caused him to be somewhat uncaring to his other clones, not truly caring of what would happen to them or what they would be truly used for.\n\nDespite his ruthlessness and accepting jobs that offered the greatest rewards, Jango was not devoid of ethics. Possessing his own code of honor, he usually accepted jobs that he felt were morally acceptable; justifying his work for crime syndicates and gangsters as most of the targets they assigned him to assassinate were criminals from rival gangs. He also felt justified in his attempts to assassinate Padme Amidala, feeling that she and most politicians were merely corrupt officials who were only interested in furthering their own interests rather than helping the people they swore to represent. He also preferred working for the Separatists, not only because of Count Dooku\u2019s substantial payments, but also because he saw them as the more legitimate faction; seeing the Galactic Republic as a decadent, ineffective, and overly corrupt government. Despite being ruthless mercenary, Jango never took pleasure in hurting or killing, preferring to kill his targets as quickly often so that they would not have to suffer unnecessary. In addition to his lack of sadism, Jango was not a believer in vengeance. Typical of an Old Mandalorian, Jango bore no grudge against the New Mandalorians for exiling from Mandalore instead accepting it and making the best of exile through his bounty hunting career. It is also implied by [[Hondo Ohnaka]], a former associate of Jango\u2019s, that Jango would have disappointed in Boba for the actions he took in trying to avenge him; disapproving of Boba hurting others who had nothing to do with his death. This shows that overall, Jango Fett was a highly amoral but very honorable man.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Attack of the Clones''===\nJango was a bounty hunter who worked for Separatist leader [[Count Dooku]], who had hired him to kill Senator [[Padme Amidala|Padm\u00e8 Amidala]]. He hired another bounty hunter, Zam Wesell, to kill her. After failed attempts on [[Coruscant]], Jango reluctantly shot her with a poison dart, killing her and preventing her from selling him out. Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] tracked him to [[Kamino]], where he found that he had a son named [[Boba Fett]] and was a genetic template for a clone army. After trying to arrest Jango, Obi-Wan was knocked down by Boba, who was piloting their ship the ''[[Slave I]]''. They were followed by Kenobi through an asteroid field, where Boba realized the two were being tracked. After a fight, Obi-Wan faked his death and eventually landed on [[Geonosis]], where Count Dooku was. Kenobi was captured and a failed rescue attempt by his padawan, [[Anakin Skywalker]], and Amidala, resulted in all three being sentenced to death.\n\nAt the execution arena, the three broke free and killed the beasts that were supposed to kill them. A Jedi strike team, led by [[Mace Windu]], arrived to rescue them. Eventually, Jango rocketed down and attacked the Jedi, resulting in Windu decapitating him, leaving Boba Fett orphaned.\n\n===Star Wars Weekends===\nJango is an occasional character at the [[Jedi Training Academy]] show. He was also a seeable and meetable character during [[Star Wars Weekends]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[2003]], [[2006]], and [[2010]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional Images===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nJango Fett render.png\nJango_Fett.jpg\nBobaJango.png\njangofett.png|Jango Fett Unmasked\njangofett123.png\nJangofullarmor.jpg\nJango And Boba.jpg\nDisneyplus - May 4th - Attack of the Clones Art.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFettInterrogatesGloom-SWBH.jpg\nJangoRecruited.png\nFettKenobiMeeting.png\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-6134.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-7090.jpg\nJango Fett Fly.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-7202.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-7275.jpg\nJango Boba.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-12087.jpg\nJango-Count.jpg\nJango Mace.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-13272.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-13284.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-13352.jpg\nStarwars2-movie-screencaps.com-13384.jpg|Jango's death\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nJango Fett Meetable Character.jpg|Jango Fett Meetable Character\nJango Fett Parade.png|Jango Fett Parade\nThe Clone Army Attacketh cover.jpg|Jango Fett on the cover of ''William Shakespeare's The Clone Army Attacketh: Star Wars Part the Second''.\nStar Wars - Jango Fett.jpeg\nJango Fett Die Cast Disney Racer - Star Wars.jpg|Jango Fett Die Cast Disney Racer\nLego Jango Fett.png|[[LEGO]] Jango Fett Minifigure\nJANGO FETT L-B.jpeg|Lego Jango Fett Buildable Figure\nJango Fett Hot Wheels.jpeg|Jango Fett Hot Wheels Car\njangofett.jpg|Jango Fett Bobblehead\nCount Dooku and Jango Fett Pin.jpg\nJango Fett Sideshow.png\nMR Ronin Jango Fett.jpg\nJango Fett Tsum Tsum.jpg\nStar-wars-weekends-2015-pete-as-jango-fett.jpg|[[Pete]] as Jango Fett\nStar Wars Collectible Figures - Prequel Set.jpg\nStar Wars Weenends Pin.jpg|Star Wars Weekends Pin\nJango Fett Racers.jpg|Jango Fett Racers\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWW|Jango Fett}}\n*{{SW|url=/databank/jango-fett|text=Jango Fett}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fett, Jango}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]"
