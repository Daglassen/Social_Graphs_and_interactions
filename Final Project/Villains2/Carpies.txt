They don't really seem to bother anyone unless their King forces them to.\n\nThe King of the Carpies is the meanest and toughest of their kind, and desperately wants a song bird and a beak warmer. It is under his reign and direct orders, that the Carpies kidnap [[Sunni Gummi]] \u2014 twice!\n\nBobo, in contrast, is the nicest Carpy introduced on the show; a trait that ultimately gets him crowned their new leader.\n\nCarpies are among the numerous foes of the [[Gummi Bears]], and notably one of the few species featured in the show's opening throughout its run.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[A Gummi in a Gilded Cage]]\"\n*\"[[Queen of the Carpies]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nE32 85.jpg|The Carpies as they appear in the [[Great Book of Gummi]]\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AGummiInAGildedCage-CarpieKing.png|The Carpy King\nE32 194.jpg\nE32 200.jpg\nE32 211.jpg\nE32 214.jpg\nCarpyking.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-08-10h22m32s701.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-08-10h22m55s107.png|Bobo\nVlcsnap-2015-08-08-10h27m25s360.png\nGrossedoutsunni.jpg\nVlcsnap-2015-08-08-10h28m33s585.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-08-10h26m38s155.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-QueenOfTheCarpies-NakedKing.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-08-10h29m17s211.png|Bobo, crowned as the Carpies' new leader\n</gallery>\n\n===Production Art===\n<gallery widths=\"180\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCarpy Mountain.jpg|Carpy Mountain storyboard\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
