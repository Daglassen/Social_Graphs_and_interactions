publication The Resurrection Doom many fans speculated that Doom real Toon form was the Pistol Packin Possum Toon seen the posters Maroon office This mainly because the Possum has red eyes just like the Toon that killed Teddy Valiant well the exact same gun that Judge Doom had the scene where shot Maroon Additionally the first scene where Valiant talks Maroon about taking the snoop job behind Maroon are posters cartoons rotating wall The the right poster the Pistol Packin Possum When Valiant and Maroon walk over the desk discuss more business the rotating wall closed and the poster along with the gun the possum holding always pointed towards Maroon with his back turned Even after the release The Resurrection Doom this theory could still somewhat valid Baron Von Rotten was known the toon with thousand faces and played many disguised roles which might have been Pistol Packin Possum There are many subtle clues throughout the film that give away the fact that Doom Toon Doom behavior

nature have lack common sense naivety how the world actually works and are over the top everything they When Doom run over the steamroller the Acme Factory merely compressed and flattened were human would have been lot messier Toontown when Jessica shoots Doom save Eddie moments seen running seemingly unaffected the gunshot During few moments prior his reveal his lens shined with completely white light that obscured his eyes done way similar how certain bespectacled cartoon and comic book villains shine with bright light when talking about their evil ambitions was slightly justified the day during the initial investigation Marvin Acme murder due the light from the windows above refracting his glasses give off more natural shine and earlier when similarly bespectacled cop glowed brightly due the sunlight However when talking about his freeway plan and during his fight with Eddie was night and there wasn enough light justify his lens sudden white obscured refraction hiding his eyes
