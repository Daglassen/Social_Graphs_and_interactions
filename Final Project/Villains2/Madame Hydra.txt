She first appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', while also appearing in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' as [[Aida|A.I.D.A.]], a programme, and the X-Men Cinematic Universe, as a [[Mutants|mutant]].\n\nMadame Hydra was created by Jim Steranko, Bob Harras and Paul Neary.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Animation]]===\n====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====\nThe Viper incarnation of the character appears in the show. She first appears as one of Baron Strucker's right hand lieutenants. At some unknown point, Viper was captured and supplanted by a Skrull who infiltrated into the HYDRA ranks. The Skrull's capture was [[Nick Fury]]'s first hint of an upcoming Skrull invasion.\n\nThe actual Viper was the first of the Skrulls' prisoners [[Captain America]] found when he was escaping himself. They freed the other prisoners (one of them her second-in-command King Cobra) and escaped together, with Viper even taking Cap on board the escape ship when it seemed he was going to be left behind.\n\nAfter the Skrull invasion was over, Viper and King Cobra were transported as prisoners by armored truck, but the rest of the Serpent Society arrived to break them out, which resulted on them trapped in the subway alongside Captain America, [[Spider-Man]] and civilian bystanders. Cap and Spidey managed to protect the bystanders from the Serpent Society.\n\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''====\n{{Main|Aida}}\n\nThe [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] iteration is an artificial intelligence entity, who takes on the alias of Madame Hydra, after transferring her consciousness into the Framework. She is well aware of her alternate identity, referring to the real world as 'The Other Place'.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nSerpent_Society1.PNG\nMadame_Hydra_AEMH_001.png|Viper being held prisoner\nViper and Cap EMH.jpg|Viper helps Captain America to escape\nSerpent_Society2.PNG|Viper along with the rest of the Serpent Society\nMadame_Hydra.png|Madame Viper\nViperCobra.png|Viper and [[King Cobra]] captive\nSerpent Society 3.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno1_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno2_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno3_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno4_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno5_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno6_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno7_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno8_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno9_1280.png\ntumblr_mrrxcrAMhS1rl14rno10_1280.png\n</gallery>\n\n===''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 4x17 - What If... - EW First Look - Madame Hydra.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===X-Men Cinematic Universe===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMadame Hydra X-Men Cinematic Universe.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Video Games===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nViper Avengers Alliance.jpg|Viper in [[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:X-Men Cinematic Universe]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:HYDRA agents]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
