Toren is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Toren can be found at the Tabantha Bridge Stable, either sitting down at the table inside or standing near the stable outside. When approached, he will be lost in thought, thinking of the Great Fairy. When Link talks to him, he will snap out of it and tell Link of the Great Fairy Kaysa. He explains that he is on a journey to find her. Toren tells Link that beyond the Tabantha Great Bridge, there is a tower, that at the right time of day, will cast a shadow pointing to the Great Fairy's location. He tells Link that he's stuck at the stable, as he cannot climb the tower. 
Afterwards, he asks Link if he would be willing to make an offering of rupees to the Great Fairy for him, starting the side quest, "A Gift for the Great Fairy". Additionally, he gives Link 500 Rupees to offer to the Great Fairy Kaysa.
