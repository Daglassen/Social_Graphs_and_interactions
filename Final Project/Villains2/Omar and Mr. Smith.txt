He often served him tea, and when they were outside the lair, he served as Olympus' personal chauffeur, driving his Cadillac limousine and his Gazelle helicopter.\n\nMr. Smith is a tall, blond man in a suit. Despite his imposing size and apparent role as Olympus' muscle, he was actually quite bright and loyal, often serving as an adviser to his employer. He seemed to be Olympus' right-hand man.\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Mr. Stallwood]] showed the footage to [[Charlie Olympus]], they went to Dr. Wilson's apartment only to find him dressing as the general to bring Jake back to his ship. With things getting complicated, they send Dr. Link to deliver a message to them saying they have Liz and Lucybelle.\n\nAt an airfield, Wilson, Link, and Jake arrived with General Stilton and the police hot on their heels, Smith sensed a trap. In reality, Stilton was unaware of Olympus' involvement and was after Wilson because he suspected him of collaborating with Jake, who he mistook for a hostile alien -- that, and Wilson had taken Stilton's uniform and command car. However, Olympus and his crew didn't know this, and so when Smith announced that he thought it was a trap, the power-made businessman did not question his henchman's instincts, and they escaped in the copter with Omar piloting.\n\nAn aerial chase ensued when Jake used his collar's power to make an old biplane fly again, allowing him and Wilson to pursue them. However, they couldn't bring it down knowing Liz and Lucybelle are still in it. Olympus, realizing Wilson wouldn't do anything to endanger them, told Omar to become more aggressive, and so Omar turned around and started doing the chasing himself. He attempted to use the Gazelle's runners to force the plane down.\n\nDuring the aerial game of cat and mouse, Smith drew a revolver and fired repeatedly at the plane after Omar failed to bring it down by banging into it with the helicopter's runners. An overeager Stallwood tried to emulate Smith using a flare gun, but fired it off too soon and hit the copter's controls. Omar told his boss that now the helicopter would only fly ahead in a straight line, unable to ascend or descend, until its fuel ran out and it crashed.\n\nOn the advice of Smith, they donned parachutes and bailed out, Smith was the first to don his chute and jump out, followed by Omar. Olympus followed a few moments later with Stallwood clinging to his suit lapels because he didn't have a parachute.\n\nBoth of them, along with Mr. Olympus and Stallwood, wound up with their parachutes caught in a tree.\n\n{{The Cat from Outer Space}}\n[[Category:The Cat from Outer Space characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
