The team was founded by Romeo. The Bad Guys United motif is to steal the mega moonstone from the museum to recharge their weapons and then capture the PJ masks to keep them from interfering with the villain's main motives.\n\n<br />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Bad Guys 1.jpg\nFile:Bad Guys 2.jpg\nFile:Bad Guys 3.jpg\nFile:Bad Guys 4.jpg\nFile:Bad Guys 5.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:PJ Masks characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
