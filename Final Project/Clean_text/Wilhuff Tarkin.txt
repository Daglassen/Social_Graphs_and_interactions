annihilation Tarkin uses the Death Star u2019s awesome power destroy the planet Alderann before reading his plans finish the Rebel Alliance restore the Republic Thankfully however not long after destroying Alderann Tarkin would meet his end the Battle Yavin Yavin when the Death Star was destroyed the young Rebel pilot and Jedi Padawan Luke Skywalker During the Clone Wars Tarkin served captain admiral the Galactic Republic Grand Army the Republic Tarkin was intelligent cunning manipulative ambitious arrogant had strong sense duty and dignity and was well known for his sharp memory never forgot favor slight and was capable recalling individuals from meetings that took place over decade before was the few people know Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader were the same person although this was because used his strong perception figure out his own rather than being told outright Unlike some other imperial officers who were simply doing their jobs Tarkin the imperials genuinely evil took great pleasure killing innocent people for little reason whether make examples them assert his authority Although Tarkin seemingly cared about the welfare the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire was quite selfish everything did was always for his own ambitions Even after Palpatine Sheev Palpatine was revealed Darth Sidious the traitor and enemy the Galactic Republic still remained loyal the latter whom had long been major supporter This may have been partly out spite towards the Jedi while Tarkin thought poorly the Force general hated the Jedi more than the Sith Tarkin had intention overthrowing Palpatine although dreamed some day being the position fulfill his ambitions Tarkin was the who ordered the replacement Clone Troopers clones with stormtroopers the few days after the Clone Wars ended Tarkin visited Kamino assess the clones and was eager have them decommissioned having disliked them from the beginning due them being artificially created and his eyes not truly human Thus contrast the Jedi Tarkin viewed the Clone Troopers expendable tools rather than comrades arms tried kill Clone Force The Bad Batch during their training session Kamino switching the function the training droids live fire hoping that this would prove how u201cuseless u201d the clones were despite him deliberately rigging the odds against them Among the Batch u2019s members was Echo the clones that rescued Tarkin from the Citadel who was also captured doing after losing most his body parts explosion during the operation This demonstrated Tarkin u2019s ungrateful nature and how strong his bigotry against the clones truly was Furthermore despite witnessing firsthand the effectiveness and skillset the clones cited normal human recruits more effective independent and cheaper than the expensive cloning process especially because the galaxy was longer open warfare Tarkin had little respect for the Jedi and the Force dismissing ancient religion During the Clone Wars Tarkin made secret his distrust for the Jedi and his belief that they were ill suited lead the Republic war effort due their traditional role peacekeepers although this view did not apply all members the order developed grudging respect for the hardened warrior Even Piell and admiration for Anakin Skywalker Even after being saved less than half dozen occasions the Jedi continued disdainful towards them and made numerous attempts diminish their authority the Republic When addressing the Jedi Council the apparent treason Ahsoka Tano disrespectfully dismissed their opinions the matter irrelevant Despite his distrust the Force general willingly served the Sith because believed they did the galaxy favor killing nearly all the Jedi also considered the Sith far more effective for the governance the galaxy due their lack morality and restraint opposed the Jedi who valued the lives innocents and adhered the morality and rules Jedi Code Tarkin dismissed the Order u2019s desire try Ahsoka accordance with Jedi tradition and insisted having her transferred military custody claiming that internal Jedi trial would seem biased During Ahsoka military tribunal before the Senate Tarkin served the prosecutor and vowed ensure both her conviction and execution whether not she was actually guilty despite the fact that she had once saved his life further demonstrating his ungrateful nature Tarkin ultimately failed achieve his goal due the confession Barriss Offee the bombing listened with great interest the Dark Jedi publicly denounced the corruption the Jedi and the Republic While annoyed having lost the opportunity kill Jedi did set Ahsoka free though refused apologize her Tarkin dismissive attitude persisted even after the Jedi Purge where believed them all have died and initially refused believe that Kanan Jarrus could Much like Palpatine Tarkin was immoral greedy power hungry cunning misanthropic hateful cruel and sadistic Like Darth Vader had qualms with killing his own men coldly ordering the The Grand Inquisitor Grand Inquisitor execute Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint for their constant failures capture the Lothal rebels addition was also unafraid killing off fellow Imperials for the sake his advancement ordered the Death Star fire the Imperial base Scarif and kill thousands surviving Imperial soldiers just eliminate Director Orson Krennic his rival for control the Death Star Tarkin further showed his petty side refusing take the blame for his own failures would often shift the blame onto others did with Minister Maketh Tua Tua when attempted punish her for the destruction his personal Star Destroyer the Lothal Rebels despite being because his own mistakes Tarkin was also humocentrist believing the inherent superiority humans all other races was the architects the Empire u2019s Human High Culture being responsible for the legalization slavery well the enslavement and genocide number intelligent species deemed inferior and unfit for the Empire u2019s needs Despite this racism Tarkin was capable showing respect and working alongside certain nonhuman individuals such Even Piell and the Grand Inquisitor though always made sure that humans were control over them While respected the Chiss Imperial Thrawn for his tactical skill and effectiveness secretly despised him and disapproved Thrawn u2019s promotion the rank Grand Admiral since made Thrawn nonhuman outrank Tarkin Tarkin also hypocritically looked down upon humans who showed compassion demonstrated cooperation with other species However unlike Palpatine Tarkin always had ulterior motive mind with his actions Whereas Palpatine was psychotic sadistic and oppressed people partly for his own enjoyment Tarkin was more level headed and always had reason for his actions explained Leia that destroyed Alderaan only because was more effective demonstration the Death Star than remote planet like Dantooine where she had claimed the Rebel base was Tarkin had regard for innocent lives was perfectly willing murder innocent individuals just make example out what happens anyone who challenged the Empire However rarely ever directly killed people himself preferring hide behind his troops lacks any form honor was perfectly willing break his word suited him like when promised that would not destroy the planet Alderaan Leia Organa told him where the rebel base was and after she apparently did went back his word and destroyed the planet anyway expressed guilt shame even remorse for this vile act his seeming find almost humorous Tarkin also held love nor loyalty towards his homeworld Eriadu callously stated was more than willing destroy with the Death Star had too showing that was willing annihilate his own people for the sake personal power Tarkin arrogance was also the point underestimating his allies enemies and former allies alike like when heard the rumors that the Lothal rebels Jedi did not believe believed they were all killed the Jedi Purge including Obi Wan Kenobi despite the fact fought alongside them the Clone Wars When his subordinates insisted that Jarrus was indeed Jedi Tarkin instead jumped the opportunity insult the Lothal Imperial garrison and sarcastically remarked that was shame they didn u2019t have someone who specialized killing Jedi eyeing the Inquisitor said this These negative traits Tarkin especially his arrogance were what eventually led his death the hands Luke Skywalker the Battle Yavin Despite the Death Star u2019s defenses being breached refused abandon the station being utterly confident its powers and severely underestimating his Rebel adversaries This arrogance and overconfidence caused him ignore the advice and warnings his subordinates resulting his death Tarkin was present with Emperor Palpatine and his

Star and determined use its destructive power destroy the Rebellion However order find their secret base would need Leia Organa Princess Leia Organa give the location the Rebel base but she refused

home planet Alderaan When reveals his intent her when she brought the bridge Darth Vader she tried talk Tarkin down begging him spare her home planet but would have none asked for final time for the

time Even though she gave Tarkin still went ahead destroying her home world and gave the order fire killing millions lives including that her adoptive father and the founders the Rebellion Bail Organa while Leia watches helplessly she held back Vader When the crew and passengers the Millennium Falcon were captured and attempted rescue the princess Tarkin ordered all sections the alert and have Darth Vader assure they not escape especially when Vader tells him that senses Obi Wan Kenobi board even when Tarkin casts doubt that could true reminding Vader that the Jedi are dead and all that remains their former Order However they did escape except Obi Wan Kenobi who was killed his former apprentice Little did they know the Imperials placed homing beacon their ship Tarkin felt uneasy about letting them because they were taking extreme risk but knew was the only way they could find the Rebel base situated the moon Yavin having discoverd Leia had lied them about Dantooine the Rebels opened attack the Death Star began orbit Yavin get into firing position Yavin Tarkin had the station prepared for firing Despite being warned dangerous chance that the Rebels may succeed denied any arrangements for evacuations and proceeded with the mission hand Unfortunately for him his overconfidence would the death him when Luke Skywalker fired proton torpedoes down the Death Star ventilation shafts which led the reactor system Then just moments before firing was killed along with the Death Star destruction Tarkin was unaware that the main gunner charge the superlaser Master Chief Gunnery Officer Tenn Graneet guilty over destroying Alderaan and slaughtering many innocent lives had tried stall for time the hopes the Death Star would destroyed first before had destroy Yavin and wipe out
