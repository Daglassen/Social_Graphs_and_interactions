It is a raccoon seen stealing food from the Parr's trash can, leading to [[Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] using his powers to stop it.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nRocky is seen as a mischievous animal. When it is first seen it is trying to get itself some food from a trash can, however, it is soon interrupted by [[Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]]. Due to this, Rocky is also shown to have a temper as it tried to fight Jack-Jack after Jack-Jack tossed it's food away. It is proven to be fearless and persistent as shown when it continues fighting Jack-Jack even after seeing his powers. It is also shown to be intelligent as shown when it knocks over a grill to put out Jack-Jack's fire powers.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nRocky looks like your standard raccoon. It has gray fur with a light/dark gray-striped tail. It has black hands, feet, and claws. Her stomach is light gray along with its face. It has brown eyes with black fur surrounding it's eyes, which prompted Jack-Jack to think it was a bad guy. Around the black fur is white fur above the eyes, with its ears being white as well.\n\n==Role in the film==\nRocky is seen in the Parr's backyard rummaging through their trash. Since Rocky is a raccoon, it has a black \"mask\" prompting [[Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] to thinking it was a burglar. Jack-Jack goes outside to go stop Rocky from \"stealing\". The raccoon gets angry after Jack-Jack takes away its food so they fight. Jack-Jack then throws the raccoon to a chair, trapping it. Jack-Jack uses his fire powers to burn the other chairs, making the raccoon scared and making it try to escape. It successfully escapes from the chair when Jack-Jack tries to burn it using the burning table. The raccoon knocks over a grill to put out Jack-Jack's fire powers. Jack-Jack then uses his laser eyes to zap the raccoon, who dodges it until it climbs in an umbrella. While the raccoon is in the umbrella, Jack-Jack tries to zap it again but it continues dodging his lasers so Jack-Jack zaps the shaft of the umbrella, making it close on the raccoon. The raccoon escapes by tearing the umbrella and tries to attack Jack-Jack once more but Jack-Jack transforms into a sticky jelly-like form, which makes the raccoon stick on him. [[Mr. Incredible|Bob]] wakes up and sees Jack-Jack fighting the raccoon so he stops the fight by carrying Jack-Jack. However, Jack-Jack, still wanting to fight, creates clones of himself to attack the raccoon. The raccoon then escapes and Bob is happy upon learning that Jack-Jack has powers.\n\nWhile Bob talks with [[Helen Parr|Helen]] on the phone, the raccoon and Jack-Jack are seen on opposite sides of the screen door, Jack-Jack indoors/Rocky outdoors, glaring at each other face-to-face, possibly wanting to fight again.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[LEGO The Incredibles]]''===\nIn the game, the raccoon is a fight for Jack-Jack, but it has two other raccoons to help it and cheer for as it fights the super baby. Rocky's boss title in the game is \"Raccoon\", which might be due to the game being released before the [[Incredibles 2 (soundtrack)|''Incredibles 2'' album]] was, where its actual name was revealed by then.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nI2 - Jack-Jack vs Racoon (3).png\nI2 Jack-Jack and the Racoon.jpg\nI2 - Jack-Jack vs Racoon (5).png\nIncredibles 2 128.png\nIncredibles 2 175.png\nIncredibles 2 141.png\nI2 - Jack-Jack vs Racoon (10).png\nIncredibles 2 poster .jpg\nJack-Jack doll.png\nFunko Incredibles 2 1.png\nIncredibles 2 - German poster.png|German poster\nFandango Incredibles 2.jpg\nCinemark_Incredibles_2.jpg\nIncredibles_2_IMAX_Poster.jpg\nIncredibles-2-poster-dolby-cinema.jpg\njack-jack-racoon.png|Rocky Clip art\njack-jack-racoon2.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The idea of having Jack-Jack fighting with a raccoon and showing the raccoon his superpowers was originally pitched by [[Teddy Newton]] for the original film. It was dropped as there wasn't room for it, but director [[Brad Bird]] loved the idea so much that he resolved to use it in the second film.\n*Rocky's name goes unmentioned in the film itself, but its name was revealed in the [[Incredibles 2 (soundtrack)|''Incredibles 2'' soundtrack]] by [[Michael Giacchino]], which states that the score used in the fighting sequence between Jack-Jack and the raccoon is named ''Rocky vs. Jack-Jack''.\n*So far, aside from the Incredible family and [[Rick Dicker]], Rocky is one of the only characters who knows that Jack-Jack has superpowers (her being the only animal who knows this). Though [[Kari McKeen]] and [[Syndrome]] learned about this during the events of the original movie, Kari got her memories wiped out by Dicker while Syndrome got killed, thus dying with the secret.\n*It is unknown if the stylized credits sequence can be considered canon, and if it is indeed, it is unknown if Jack-Jack got Rocky burned to death, but it is likely that Bob appeared to save Rocky from Jack-Jack's roguery since he did the first time.\n*Though their enmity in the film is clear, Rocky and Jack-Jack are paired as if they are friends in some merchandise.\n*Rocky is inspired by, but not to be confused with, [[wikipedia:Rocky Raccoon|The Beatles song]] of the same name.\n\n{{The Incredibles}}\n[[Category:The Incredibles characters]]\n[[Category:Raccoons]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar Popcorn characters]]"
