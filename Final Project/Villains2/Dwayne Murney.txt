He has an extreme displeasure towards Seth and Zoe, calling them the worst students in the school; they turned up late several times and Seth was on the wrestling team and Zoe was taking Drivers Ed which they kept skipping. When they are being taken care off by Shane, he calls the Plummer residence to inform the kids to arrive at school on time unless they want to face punishment.\n\nOnce Shane and the kids get to the school, Murney introduces himself and states his disdain for Zoe and Seth before being interrupted by the principal, [[Claire Fletcher]]. He then leaves to deal with a case of baloney slices that had been continuously appearing on the cafeteria ceiling.\n\nSeth is later picked on by the other members of the wrestling team, but Murney only sees it as an opportunity to get Seth to toughen up and encourages it. After Zoe accidentally crashes her car while she is taking Drivers Ed, he has her, Shane and Seth called into Claire's office. When Shane attempts to state that the damage done to the car would already be paid for by the insurance company, Murney states that his main focus is on Seth; when he shows up for wrestling practice, he has dyed his hair blonde. Murney later starts doing some recon on Seth and finds a Nazi armband in his locker.\n\nMurney later orders that Seth be strictly punished after finding him dancing under the bleachers to no music, but Seth ends up gaining encouragement from Shane and quits himself. After Murney accuses him of being a quitter, he then laughs at Seth and accuses him of not being a man after he reveals himself to be in a production of ''The Sound of Music''. This ends up leading to Murney and Shane having a wrestling match after school later that day, which Shane bests him in.\n\nAfter the match, Murney ends up in a neck brace. He himself later gets involved in the production of ''The Sound of Music'' Seth entered himself in, playing a nun. He ends up enjoying it, as Claire says that he'd finally found his true calling, and is even replaced by Shane as the wrestling team's coach.\n\n{{The Pacifier}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Pacifier characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Principals]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
