The second cub act obediently their parents Kion The Lion Guard Return the Roar Kion was reluctant enter the Outlands hinting that was informed Simba the dangers there Vitani has slightly shifting design throughout the film cub Vitani was shown without dark earmarks and pointier cheeks Similar Kovu adolescent her cheeks became rounded Similarly Kiara and Nala and was sometimes drawn with dark earmarks and sometimes without One error right Zira was leading the Outsiders war had her drawn with pointed cheeks This inconsistency was rectified The Lion Guard Her name was originally named Shetani but since the word means Devil Swahili her name was changed Vitani Vita means War Swahili and Life Latin suggested that her name portmanteau meaning Demon War However during the fight scene the film Nala appears say Vitelleni rather than Vitani pointing out the potential that the name was changed after production had already begun and they had mixed old take her saying Shetani with new take after the name change The actual name Vitani means Flax Linens Swahili but the comparison was logical because the makers thought that Shetani sounded rude and was insulting the character Vitani the second three lionesses The Lion King franchise The Lion King franchise have blue eyes The first being Nala though her eyes are teal The Lion King and green The Lion King u00bd and the third Zuri Vitani bears resemblance Tama female lion cub who was friend Nala The Lion King comic Trouble Paradise Though unlike Vitani Tama had brown eyes instead blue She the first lioness leader the Lion Guard and Vitani Lion Guard the first Lion Guard all whose members are female However she technically the second female Fuli repeatedly took command the Guard when Kion illness got especially bad Despite being the older sibling the future king Vitani still second born child possible Vitani not only inherited Kion role and power but also his catchphrase Heyvi Kabisa well This can implied since she was the only member her Guard not have her own catchphrase and her final line Kion favorite phrase Vitani Vitani Vitani Vitani Vitani Vitani Vitani u0412 u0438 u0442 u0430 u043d u0438"
