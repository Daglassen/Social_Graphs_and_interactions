=== Breath of the Wild ===

Guardian Skywatchers are a flying type of Guardian. They scan their environment with a red searchlight, and will begin charging their laser upon locating Link. Many Guardian Skywatchers patrol around Hyrule Castle. In all locations, they're corrupted by the Malice of Calamity Ganon. However, three uncorrupted Guardian Skywatchers appear in The Champions' Ballad DLC Pack, as part of the Main Quest "EX Champion Mipha's Song". Another two can also be found within the Final Trial.
Link must use aerial tactics to defeat Guardian Skywatchers, either by getting close with the Paraglider, or shooting Arrows. They fly with the use of propellers, which can be damaged to ground them. When firing their lasers, they will sometimes fire in rapid succession if their health is low enough and Link has not moved too far from when they fired their last laser. These rapid lasers will stop if Link gets hit too far from their last firing point, if Link is no longer within their range, or at a random stopping point.
If Link hits a Guardian Skywatcher in its eye using a Bow, it will temporarily be stunned. Sometimes when doing this, the Guardian Skywatcher will retract its head in order to mess up Link's aim. If Link is aiming at its eye while it has already retracted, its head may extend. Using Stasis + on a charging up Guardian Skywatcher will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during Stasis. On death, Guardian Skywatchers lose their propellers and fall to the ground before exploding. Guardian Skywatchers may be immobilized by shooting at its propellers with a Bow. All three propellers must be destroyed before the Guardian Skywatcher falls to the ground.
In Master Mode, Guardian Skywatchers will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge-up phase before firing their laser, in order to throw off Link's timing.
