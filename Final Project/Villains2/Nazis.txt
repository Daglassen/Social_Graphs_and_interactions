In [[1933]], the Nazis took over Germany's parliament via the Nazi Adolph Hitler who had been appointed as chancellor and later dictator of the nation.\n\nIn [[1939]], the Nazi party invaded [[Poland]] for resources and territory. As a result, Germany was declared an enemy of [[Britain]] and [[France]] which resulted in what would become World War II. This war would be split between two major factions spanning the globe, the Axis (which were supporters of Hitler's dictatorship and included [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]), and the Allies which opposed the Nazis.\n\nIn [[1941]] Hitler and the Nazis began the Holocaust in-which they began arresting Jewish people, Romani people, people of color, the disabled, and people of the LGBTQ+ community such as gay people. They subsequently began forcing them into prison-camps and death camps where they would be kept in inhumane conditions and executed.\n\nBy the end of the war in [[1945]], the allies defeated the Axis and the Nazis but the damage which they left were immeasurable with millions having been killed by the Holocaust alone. Hitler is recorded to have died in 1945 by an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound due to the fear of Russian allies invading Germany. Horrifically, while the original Nazis of Germany were dealt with, large amounts of their supporters persisted into modern day across the world due to hatred and fear mongering.\n\n==Film Appearances==\n===''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''===\nThey stage an amphibious landing near [[Pepperinge Eye]] under the command of [[Colonel Heller]] in the Wehrmacht, who lies that \"This is no invasion, this is just exercise.\" [[Miss Eglantine Price]] first attempts to show her witchcraft by transforming the commanding officer into a \"nice, white rabbit\", but can't remember the spell and her claim to be a witch is taken as nonsense.\n\nLater, however, she casts a powerful [[Substitutiary Locomotion|spell]] which causes old British military uniforms and suits of armor to be [[Knights|occupied]] by their ghosts, a slew of soldiers from history such as Redcoats and Highlanders rise up, causing the Nazis embarrassment as well as defeat. However, when the Nazis blow up her workshop, the spell is broken when Miss Price (who was flying nearby) is caught at the edge of the explosion and is blown into nearby bushes, thus losing her concentration on the spell.\n\nAs the mortified Nazis are leaving the land, the Home Guard appear at the coast and fire shots as the Nazis retreat back to the Kriegsmarine submarine that brought them to [[England]]. Presumably, they return to their native country of Germany or another Nazi-occupied area.\n\n===''Indiana Jones''===\n====''Raiders of the Lost Ark''====\nThe Nazis are the main-antagonists of this film set in [[1936]], attempting to get their hands on the Arc of the Covenant from Jewish faith to try and weaponize it to use in the war. They travel to Egypt to try and find the ark and kill both Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood in their own search for the ark. After Jones' finds the Ark, the Nazis make the mistake of opening it and are horrifically but cathartically killed by the Jewish God for their crimes against the Jewish people.\n\n====''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''====\nThis film in [[1938]] has Indiana Jones racing against the Nazis to try and find the Holy Grail after they kidnap his father to try and extract information from him. By the end of the film, the Nazis are defeated thanks to the Grail's temple collapsing on them.\n\n===''[[The Rocketeer]]''===\nThe Nazis are the primary antagonists in this film set in 1938. In it they attempt to smuggle a jet-pack only for it to wind up in the ownership of an American stuntman named [[Cliff Secord]] who quickly becomes an enemy of the Nazis. This leads up to a battle over the skies of [[Hollywood]] where the Rocketeer manages to kill the Nazis in a fiery explosion.\n\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\nThe MCU features a branch of the Nazis called [[HYDRA]].\n\n==Shorts and television==\n===''[[Education for Death]]''===\nThis was a [[1943]] short-film made to inform western audiences on how Nazis conditioned soldiers from a young age such as the film's protagonist [[Little Hans]].\n\n===''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]''===\nThis 1943 short was made to mock the Nazis and other members of the Axis. Much of the short revolves around [[Donald Duck]] stuck in a nightmare where he is a Nazi weapons-manufacturer. It should be noted that while this short was noble in its effort against the Nazi party, it also contains a racist caricature of Japanese general [[wikipedia:Hideki Tojo|Hideki Tojo]], however, it should also be noted that Hideki and his Japanese forces were principal members of the Axis and that every villain in the short is exaggeratedly caricatured, in addition to the fact that this is a World War II propaganda cartoon.\n\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n[[HYDRA]], the MCU's branch of the Nazis, appears in ''[[Agent Carter]]'' and ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\n\n===Marvel animated shows===\n[[HYDRA]], Marvel's branch of the Nazis, appears in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', ''[[Avengers Assemble]]'', ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''.\n\n==[[Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!]]===\nDisney cast-members portray Nazi officers in this live-show where they try to fight Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood only to be defeated by the heroes.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Bedknobs and Broomsticks}}\n{{Indiana Jones}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{The Rocketeer}}\n{{Peter Pan}}\n{{The Chronicles of Narnia}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Bedknobs and Broomsticks characters]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Indiana Jones characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Captain America characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:The Rocketeer characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Agent Carter characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Ant-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Iron Man characters]]\n[[Category:Thor characters]]\n[[Category:The Incredible Hulk characters]]\n[[Category:Captain Marvel characters]]\n[[Category:Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:What If...? characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]\n[[Category:Peter Pan characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]"
