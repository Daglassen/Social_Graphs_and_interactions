It is hidden at the end of the [[Karusa Valley]] in the [[Gerudo Desert]]. [[Link]] must go there in order to recover [[Riju]]'s stolen [[Thunder Helm]] as part of the \"{{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Naboris (Quest)|link}}\" {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}}. Before entering, Link will find himself in a circular chamber full of [[Torch]]es. From here he will see several sets of stairs and cloth banners around him. He can burn the banners to reveal the objects and enemies behind them. Behind one of the banners is the entrance to the Yiga Clan Hideout.\n\nOnce inside, Link will meet an imprisoned [[Gerudo]] soldier named [[Barta]] who gives Link a hint about the Yiga Clan's affinity for [[Mighty Bananas]].<ref>{{Cite|All I ever see them do is patrol and eat {{Color|BotW Red|bananas}}. I haven't seen anything else that you could exploit as a weakness.|Barta|BotW}}</ref> Link must sneak past all of the patrolling [[Yiga Blademaster]]s in the hideout to reach the end, who carry out torches as well armed with their signature [[Windcleaver]]. Should a Blademaster spot Link, he will whistle, shutting the doors, alerting all other Blademasters in the room and summoning two [[Yiga Footsoldier]]s with [[Duplex Bow]]s. When this happens, all Blademasters drop their torches, which can Link can pick up if he is in desperate need of a weapon. This can happen in both rooms, meaning Link may fight up to seven Blademasters and four Footsoldiers inside the hideout as there are two Blademasters in the first room and five in the second. The Blademaster ranged Windcleaver attacks and Footsoldier arrows function normally, but should Link be struck directly with the [[Windcleaver|blade]] of a Blademaster he will instantly die regardless of the number of hearts he has and whether he has fairies in his inventory or posses the blessing [[Mipha's Grace]]. He will be warned of the [[Yiga]] for underestimating them, given a [[Game Over]], then sent to the start of the Yiga Clan Hideout.<ref>{{Cite|Beware, fool, the eye of the Yiga.|Yiga|BotW}}</ref>. Link can use Mighty Bananas to lure the Blademasters and sneak past them when they are not looking. After sneaking past the first Blademaster, Link will encounter another one in the next room guarding an open doorway. There is a treasure chest in this room containing a sapphire. Two Mighty Bananas can be found sitting on wooden platforms on the walls, which can be shot with arrows to make the bananas drop down and lure the Blademaster.\n\nThrough the doorway, if Link continues forward he will find a ladder that leads up to an upper walkway to the side a large room with several Blademasters guarding the area. At the end of the walkway, he will find a small room with a treasure chest containing a topaz and a table with 18 Mighty Bananas, serving as plenty of stock for luring Blademasters. In the large room, Link will find more wooden platforms that he can burn to cause Mighty Bananas to drop. There is also a ladder which leads another set of central upper walkways in the room which gives Link a wider variety of sneaking strategies. Link may also hide under the {{Term|BotW|Barrel|link}} present in the room to sneak by. There is a treasure chest containing a [[Silver Rupee]] on the central platform with a Yiga Clan symbol on it. There are also three large cloth banners hanging on the eastern wall. Link can burn them with Fire Arrows and will find two treasure chests each containing a [[Gold Rupee]] in a secret room behind the middle banner. Link can also find a ladder in this secret room which leads to a back entrance to the central upper walkways, with another chest containing a topaz above the doorway. Once Link successfully sneaks past the Blademasters and through the open doorway to the east, he will find himself in a small room with a treasure chest in the center which contains [[Mighty Bananas]]. Link will also find three treasure chests buried in the ground nearby which requires him to use [[Magnesis]] to retrieve each one of them. Two of the chests contain a topaz with the other one containing a ruby. To proceed, Link must use Magnesis on the wall to the east to reveal a secret exit.\n\nThrough the secret exit, Link will find himself outside of the Yiga Clan Hideout in an open area with a large pit in the center. He is then face-to-face with the Leader of the Yiga Clan, Master Kohga. Kohga will recognize that Link is the person he and his clan have been looking for and initiate a battle.<ref>{{Cite|Yeah, IT'S YOU! You're that Link guy I've been looking for!|Master Kohga|BotW}}</ref> After defeating Kohga, he will use his magic to perform his \"secret technique,\" summoning a very large, spiky metallic Yiga ball, which rolls backwards and knocks him into the large pit nearby.<ref>{{Cite|I need to bust out my serious moves... A secret technique taught by my father's mother's father! It will...destroy you!|Master Kohga|BotW}}</ref> While falling down the pit, Kohga is heard yelling that he shall be remembered and the Yiga Clan will track Link to the ends of [[Hyrule]].<ref>{{Cite|Coward! I shall be remembered! The Yiga Clan will track you to the ends of Hyruuuule!|Master Kohga|BotW}}</ref> Because of this, Yiga encounters in the [[Overworld]] will become more common. A treasure chest will then appear containing the stolen Thunder Helm that Link came for. It will give Riju the power to withstand Divine Beast Naboris' [[Lightning]] and protect Link from it so that he can enter Naboris.<ref>{{Cite|A precious Gerudo heirloom reclaimed from the Yiga.
