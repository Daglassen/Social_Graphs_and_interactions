Garshon is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Garshon is a Hylian found at Serenne Stable, where he debates the cause of the leviathans' extinction with his brothers. However, their search for the remains has not been lucky, so they have decided to rest at the Stable. He wonders why they are wasting time at the Stable, when it would be better to go out and find the skeletons.
When Link speaks to Garshon's brother, Akrah, he can hear the three brothers discussing their theories on the leviathans' extinction. Garshon's theory is that the leviathans went extinct due to a sudden drought. Akrah reveals to Link that they have a general idea where the three skeletons can be found, and he asks Link to locate them and bring pictures back. Accepting his request begins the "Leviathan Bones" Side Quest.
Garshon requires a picture of the Gerudo Great Skeleton, located in the Gerudo Desert. When Link shows him a picture, he is shocked at how good Link is at drawing. He believes it is the evidence he needs to prove his theory about the drought. He encourages Link to help Akrah and Onya with their own pictures. If Garshon is the last one that Link shows the picture to, he will give Link his reward. He asserts that Link's pictures will be valuable for his and his brothers' research.
Garshon is very invested in his theory, even panting in his sleep. When Link speaks to him, he reiterates how useful the picture will be to him. He doesn't like rain, but he likes to stay inside and think about leviathans during such times.
