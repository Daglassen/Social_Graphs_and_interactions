She was a hotel inspector from Germany in her first appearance. \n\nIlsa has much experience in the hotel-inspecting business and enforces her work with a strong attitude. After being fired from Tipton Industries, Ilsa became the manager of the Saint Mark Hotel, the Tipton Hotel's heaviest competitor located just across the street. She tells Mr. Moseby that she plans to tear down the hotel and turn it into a giant parking lot, with him parking the cars. At the Saint Mark Hotel, Ilsa also looks after Mr. St Mark's son, who once tried to go out with London after falling in love with her. In general, Ilsa is just a mean German hotel inspector that is the archenemy of Mr. Moseby, the Tipton Hotel, and the Tipton family. She is very scary, as even Carey Martin screamed in terror upon seeing her again, and she proudly stated that she \"once bit a shark\".\n\nIlsa was later fired from her job working as a Tipton hotel inspector, due to her cruelty and inability to inspire true loyalty in employees.\n\nIn the episode [[Bowling]], it is revealed that she is also the leader of Team St. Mark, the biggest rival to Team Tipton and helps her team (mainly consisting of her St. Mark crew) beat them in every sport (like flag football, for example), except bowling when they lost after Arwin used his courage to help his team win (thanks to Zack helping him) by overcoming his fear and scoring a number of strike shots.\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*Caroline Rhea, who plays Ilsa, would later be the voice of [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]] on ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''., where [[Ashley Tisdale]] (Maddie) would voice Candace Flynn and [[Brenda Song]] (London), [[Phill Lewis]] (Moesby), and [[Brian Stepanek]] (Arwin) would guest star.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Suite Life}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Suite Life characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Suite Life]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
