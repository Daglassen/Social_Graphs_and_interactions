Batroc accepts his defeat and surrenders to go to jail, but \"Spider-Man\" viciously beats him and Batroc must be hospitalized.\n\nSometime later, when [[Electro]] caused a general shutdown, Batroc tried to take advantage of it to steal, but he was stopped by Spider-Man and his team.\n\n===''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''===\nBatroc, a former member of the French Foreign Legion who racked up over a hundred kills before being discharged, conducted a terrorist occupation on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] ship ''Lemurian Star'' with a mercenary army.\n\nHowever, he was thwarted by Captain America (though not without a huge struggle between the two), although because Black Widow chose to delay aiding him in an attempt to back up data on the tanker (implied to be on Nick Fury's orders), he managed to escape into the night, leaving behind an explosive that Rogers and Romanov narrowly managed to evade.\n\nHe was eventually captured the day afterwards and interrogated. It was later revealed that he had been anonymously hired by [[Nick Fury]] as cover to retrieve data from the ship, as he suspected that S.H.I.E.L.D. may have been compromised.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBatroc_USM.png\nTWS on Set II.jpg\nCap-batroc.jpg\nBatroc Avengers Alliance.jpg|Batroc from [[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\nBaltroconthedeck.jpg\nBatroc_the_Leaper.png\nBatroc Smile.png\nBatroc Interrogation.png\nBatroc3-TWS.png\nBatrocLopez-TWS.png\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier - 1x01 - New World Order - Photography - Batroc.jpg\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier - 1x05 - Truth - Photography - Batroc and Karli.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Captain America characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:The Falcon and The Winter Soldier characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:What If...? characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Timeline Versions]]"
