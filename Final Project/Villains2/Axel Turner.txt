It turns out that he and Director Brown used to be bandmates, but one day, Brown removed Axel from the band, so then Axel founded Camp Star to compete with Brown, explaining their rivalry. He has the Camp Star performers send parachutes to the campers at Camp Rock as a way of inviting them to participate at a \"bonfire\". After the Camp Rockers arrive at Camp Star, the two camps perform. Axel offers the Camp Rock counselors jobs at Camp Star and promises to double their salary, prompting many counselors (and a few campers, namely [[Tess Tyler|Tess]]) to switch over to Camp Star, much to Brown's upset. Unbeknownst to Axel, however, his daughter [[Dana Turner|Dana]] strikes up a relationship with [[Nate Grey]].\n\nThe next day, Axel spies the two camps musically waging war and proposes a televised competition. Unsurprisingly, [[Mitchie Torres|Mitchie]] agrees to the idea. Later that night, he catches Dana singing with Nate. On the day of the competition, Brown discovers that Axel has been rigging the competition by persuading the public to vote for Camp Star via text-messaging. The two camps give an all-out performance, but Camp Star wins, much to Axel's pleasure. He is not seen after that, so what happens to him later is uncertain.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Axel and Brown were once in a band called Wet Crows.\n*Axel Turner is one of the few Disney villains to actually win.\n\n{{Camp Rock}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Axel}}\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Camp Rock characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
