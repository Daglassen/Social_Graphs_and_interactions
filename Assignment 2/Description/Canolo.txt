She was previously traveling with her friends {{Term|BotW|Sesami|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Oliff|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Canolo|link}}, and {{Term|BotW|Palme|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, did you happen to see any of my friends? They're four travelers named {{Color|BotW Blue|Oliff}}, {{Color|BotW Blue|Flaxel}}, {{Color|BotW Blue|Canolo}}, and {{Color|BotW Blue|Palme}}....|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> However, the five of them were attacked by {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin|link}} on the path to {{Term|BotW|Koukot Plateau|link}} and ended up separated.<ref>{{Cite|I don't know... We were all walking together when some monsters suddenly jumped us near the {{Color|BotW Blue|Koukot Plateau path}}.|Sesami|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Canyon Stable|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} can find Sesami, who managed to escape.<ref>{{Cite|I took off running and didn't stop until I got here.|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> He asks Link to let Canolo and the rest of his friends know that he's waiting for them at the Stable.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, if you happen to run into any of my friends on the road, please let them know Sesami is waiting for them here.|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> This initiates the {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}} \"{{Term|BotW|Missing in Action|link}}\".\n\nCanolo can be found on the Gerudo Canyon's scaffolding across from Koukot Plateau, where she's being attacking by a {{Term|BotW|Blue Bokoblin|link}}. After saving her,<ref>{{Cite|Wait...<br>Am I...saved?|Canolo|BotW}}</ref> Canolo expresses her anger towards Sesami for abandoning them.<ref name=\"Girl\"/> She agrees to go to the Gerudo Canyon Stable, though she's still upset.<ref>{{Cite|He's at the Gerudo Canyon Stable? If he thinks I'm going to forgive him for this, he's got another thing coming!|Canolo|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen she makes it to the Stable, Canolo calls Sesami a {{Term|BotW|Cucco|link}} and thanks Link for saving her.<ref>{{Cite|Sesami is such a Cucco. If you hadn't come along... *shudder* Thanks for saving me.|Canolo|BotW}}</ref> She admits that she didn't know traveling could be so dangerous, as it wasn't mentioned in the guidebook she read.<ref>{{Cite|I had no idea traveling was so dangerous. There was nothing like this in the travel guidebook. I guess you can't assume to know anything until you experience it for yourself.|Canolo|BotW}}</ref> Having decided traveling isn't her thing, Canolo plans on heading back home after she rests.<ref>{{Cite|But at least I've figured out that traveling isn't my thing. I'm going to rest here awhile and then head back home.|Canolo|BotW}}</ref> However, she has a feeling Link doesn't have the option to go home, so she wishes him well.<ref>{{Cite|I get the feeling that going home isn't an option for you, so take care of yourself out there.|Canolo|BotW}}</ref>\n\nCanolo and the rest of her friends chip in to give Link a {{Term|BotW|Gold Rupee|link}} as thanks for saving them.<ref>{{Cite|Sorry it's so small. Everyone chipped in for it, but we're in the middle of traveling, y'know?|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> After the Quest is complete, Canolo and her friends, with the exception of Sesami, disappear from the Stable.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nCanolo and her friends are named after types of {{Wp|Vegetable oil}}, specifically {{Wp|Canola oil}}.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nfile:BotW Canolo.jpg|Canolo when Link rescues her\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Gerudo Canyon|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Gerudo Canyon Stable|link}}\n* \"{{Term|Series|Missing in Action|link}}\"\n* {{Term|Series|Flaxel|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Oliff|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Palme|link}}\n* {{Term|Series|Sesami|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
