A former toymaker, he turned crazy and adopted a jester appearance, with an arsenal of deadly toys at his command. He's also one of [[Negaduck]]'s [[Fearsome Five]].\n\n==Background==\nHe was once a toymaker who was put out of business after the \"Whiffle Boy\" video game market expanded. Understandably, he has a particular hatred of \"Whiffle Boy\" video games and toys. He became a supervillain who robbed banks to get money to fund his toymaking ventures and uses his toys to aid him for his crimes in most episodes. However, he's a genius who has built many successful toys. His catchphrase is \"It's PLAYTIME!\"\n\nQuackerjack seems to be influenced by the classic clownish archetype of supervillain that includes the Joker, the Trickster, [https://warner-bros-characters.fandom.com/wiki/Punch Punch] and Jewelee, the Harlequin, the Prankster, Toyman, and the Clown. He also has a doll named Mr. Banana Brain (a parody of [[Mr. Potato Head]]), whom he carries around and talks to. Generally, he adapts a high pitched voice to have the puppet talk back in rhyming form. Other dangerous toys used by Quackerjack are a Giant teddy bear robot which destroyed a \"Whiffle Boy\" warehouse before self-destructing; a giant \"Crying Crissie\" doll with which he tried to unsuccessfully flood \"Whiffle Boy\" town, a pair of robot chattering teeth, and apathy causing toy called Mr. Relaxatron and his most fiendish torture device- - Mr. History, a talking trivia doll which repeats useless historical facts endlessly over and over!\n\nMost times Quackerjack works alone, but he has been known to team up with [[Megavolt]] and was a member of the Fearsome Five (led by [[Negaduck]] and including [[Bushroot]], [[Liquidator]], and Megavolt). His superpower is his \"wackiness,\" which hardily annoys Negaduck.\n\n===Personality===\nQuackerjack was originally a deranged toymaker whose toys were dangerous and defective, and his company ended up getting shut down. Blaming the gaming company \"Whiffle Boy\" for his company's failure, he went over the edge and turned to a life of crime, driven by what he calls his \"wackiness\" to rob banks and cause chaos for a twisted thrill.\n\nHe is generally hyperactive, clownish, and usually in a jolly mood unless provoked.\n\nHe keeps a toy he calls Mr. Banana-Brain, talking to it and making it seem like it's talking.\n\nEver since Negaduck destroyed Mr. Banana-Brain, Quackerjack went even further over the edge and became more of a terrorist and sadist than before. However, this was also due to everyone stealing his ideas for toys and he started becoming more insane than ever.\n\nWhen Quackerjack was reunited with his original Mr. Banana-Brain, he began to show remorse for what he had done and committed suicide by transforming himself into a lifeless doll, believing it was the best thing he would ever be.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nLike Negaduck, Quackerjack possesses no superhuman abilities, though that makes him no less dangerous than any other villain. While no martial artist, Quackerjack is incredibly athletic, capable of performing perfect backflips and impressive leaps. In fact, his acrobatic affinity and use of lethal gadgets make him a top tier villain, also, his madness makes him highly unpredictable.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Darkwing Duck]]''===\n[[File:Quackerjack.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]\nQuackerjack is a brilliant toymaker, but all his creations tend to be dangerous cleverly-disguised weapons or tools he uses to escape. His trademark toy is chattering teeth that bite. Otherwise, he's used a number of toy or joke-based weapons and gadgets, like pogo-sticks, electric joy buzzers, and more.\n\nQuackerjack once even invented the time machine called the Time Top (due to its design being based on a spinning top).\n\nHis debut was in \"[[Whiffle While You Work]]\", in which he first met [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing]] (though he seemed to know him from somewhere, Darkwing didn't know him) and their rivalry was established.\n\nIn \"[[The Haunting of Mr. Banana Brain]]\", he stole a haunted jack-in-the-box that contained a demonic entity named [[Paddywhack]], who possessed his doll for a little while and fed on the emotion of suffering that he causes others. Quackerjack noticed a change in the voice of his doll (Paddywhack's voice was far deeper than the high pitch Quackerjack used for the doll himself) but seemed unsurprised that the doll was moving and talking under its own power. This means Quackerjack likely is not aware of the doll lacking the life of its own (though he seems aware that it is a doll), suggesting insanity and draws a parallel to [[Wikipedia:Batman|Batman]]'s almost contemporary villain [[Wikipedia:The Ventriloquist|the Ventriloquist]] (created in 1988, only three years before Darkwing Duck). In the episode, he was forced to team up with Darkwing Duck to get rid of Paddywhack, or submit to eternal torment specifically designed by Paddywhack with Quackerjack in mind: Paddywhack would fiendishly (from Quackerjack's point-of-view) force Quackerjack to adopt \"normal\" modes of behavior. This was raucously characterized by the depiction of Quackerjack dressed in a business suit.\n\nIn \"[[Toys Czar Us]]\", he forced the manager of a toy store to stock shelves with his personal brand of fun, despite protest.\n\nIn \"[[Quack of Ages]]\", he went back in time using his Time Top to eliminate the very first yo-yo. This ranks to Darkwing's intervention, this ended in his accidental aiding of the invention of the yo-yo.\n\nIn \"[[Time and Punishment]]\", he used the top to travel into the future with [[Megavolt]] to discover more advanced toys. Thanks to an accidental kidnapping of [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]], he turned Darkwing into the revenge-crazed DarkWarrior Duck.\n\nAs a member of the Fearsome Five, Quackerjack appeared in the episode \"[[Just Us Justice Ducks]]\". In a fight with Gizmoduck, it is revealed Quackerjack has false teeth (though this may have likely been a gag).\n\nIn \"[[Stressed to Kill]]\", Quackerjack teamed up with Megavolt again, and, using a toy called Mr. Relaxatron, the two had the city in an apathetic daze as they robbed it blind and caused mass mayhem. Throughout the episode, he constantly annoys Megavolt by calling him \"Sparky\".\n\nA friendly, more gentle Quackerjack is seen as one of the members of the \"Friendly Four\" in \"[[Life, the Negaverse, and Everything]]\". He's still insane but more docile and actually has somewhat of a conscience, being he still makes toy weaponry but only to use against Negaduck while he gives normal toys to children.\n\nHe briefly appeared as a Fearsome Five member again in the episode \"[[Jail Bird]]\". When Negaduck stole the powers of the other four members, it was revealed that Quackerjack's superpower was \"wackiness\" (a euphemism for mania), without which he became depressed and whiny.\n\n===''[[Goof Troop]]''===\nIn the episode \"[[Axed by Addition]]\", Quackerjack makes a cameo on [[Max Goof|Max]]'s watch.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nIn the episode \"[[Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!]]\", an actor playing Quackerjack is shown in the ''Darkwing Duck'' television series that Launchpad is a fan of. The actor playing Quackerjack is shown robbing a bank, along with the actors playing Liquidator and Megavolt, but they are defeated by Jim Starling, the actor playing Darkwing Duck.\n\nThe ''real'' Quackerjack later appears in the Season 3 episode, \"[[Let's Get Dangerous!]]\", summoned by Taurus Bulba via Ramrod in a plan to take out Darkwing Duck and destroy the city of St. Canard. During the plan, Darkwing, Gosalyn, and Launchpad spy on Quackerjack planning to take over the Cranky Frank's toy store, just as Quackerjack controls a gigantic robotic version of himself just as he chases the trio across the city. The three manage to hide from Quackerjack just before Liquidator arrives and prepares to attack the trio. Furthermore, Darkwing plans to face Bulba and the rest of the villains he summoned.\n\nLater, Gosalyn and Launchpad notice Quackerjack, Liquidator, and Megavolt attacking Darkwing in combat via W.A.N.D.A. to which the two plan to save Darkwing from the villains. Arriving at the area where the Ramrod is at, Gosalyn, Launchpad, and Darkwing perform a surprise attack and fight against the Fearsome Five in combat to which during battle, Quackerjack prepares to throw explosive bananas at Darkwing and Launchpad to which Darkwing reflects Liquidator's ability on Quackerjack to which the duo manages to foil them. With the Ramrod activated, Quackerjack and the rest of the villains (with the exception of Bulba) are sucked back into the rift to which afterwards, the rift closes.\n\n==Printed media==\n===''Darkwing Duck'' comics===\n[[File:Darkwing-Duck-1122ridr-26333947-627-568.png|thumb|250px|Quackerjack reunites with his comrades in the first issue of Boom! Studios' ''Darkwing Duck'' comic book.]]\nIn the series' comic book revival under [[Boom! Studios]], Quackerjack's character was revamped. In the first arc, \"[[The Duck Knight Returns]]\", he became evilier after [[Negaduck]] destroyed his Banana-Brain doll. He worked for Quackwerks much to his joy since he can apply his ideas to the company, but then he really snapped after no one would listen to his ideas. He became the leader of the Fearsome Four (minus Negaduck), destroyed a Crime-Bot with his bare hands, and blew up buildings with exploding action figures of himself.\n\nAfter he was carted away to prison, Quackerjack later escaped and, in the single-issue story \"[[Toy With Me]]\", got a device that would turn St. Carnardians into soulless little toys. It is revealed he has a girlfriend named Claire. [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing]] manages to stop his plan and make him think things through, but Quackerjack escapes and turns himself into a toy at Claire's doorstep (which could also count as a suicide), claiming it is all he'll ever be.\n\nIn Boom!'s final arc, \"[[Dangerous Currency]]\", Quackerjack is revived after getting touched by [[Slime Nega Duck|the slime]] that [[Magica De Spell]] uses to take over [[Duckburg]] and [[St. Canard]]. However, this story arc was never approved by [[the Walt Disney Company]] and is not considered canon.\n\nCanonically, Quackerjack is shown to have been resurrected in a one-page cameo in \"Dawn of the Day of the Return of the Living Spud II: Army of Starchness\", published in issue #8 of [[Darkwing Duck (Joe Books)|the continuation]] by [[Joe Books]]. He is shown watching a news report on TV while working on a plan he has in store for St. Canard's upcoming toy expo, setting up what would've been the story arc for the comic's next three issues. It is unknown how he was changed back from a doll, and due to Disney cancelling the comic, it will likely never be explained, though Aaron Sparrow has hinted that he may have never actually turned into a doll in the first place.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TehD2tAOl4k&t=41m08s Interviews from the Multiverse: Aaron Sparrow]</ref>\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Darkwing Duck (video game)|Darkwing Duck]]''===\nQuakerjack appears as a boss character in the video game. Darkwing battles him at the end of the bridge level.\n\n===''[[DuckTales: Scrooge's Loot]]''===\nOnce a player equips the Inventor costume, they can use an attack where there is a Quackerjack-In-The-Box.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"Stressed to Kill,\" Quackerjack is shown to have the ability to speak German while under the guise of Dr. Heebie.\n*According to ''Flapping Terror's interview with Tad Stones'', Quackerjack was intended to be a darker character, much like The Joker, but he ended up being written as a more silly, eccentric type villain, which Stones was disappointed with. This was changed within the [[2011]] comic series.\n*Some of Quackerjack's criminal ways are based on some comic book villains: Joker and Toyman. Similarly, \"[[Toy With Me]]\"'s cover was taken from the Batman one-shot ''The Killing Joke'', which gave some backstory and development to the Joker such as revealing him to have become the way he was due to a \"very bad day.\"\n\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[ar:\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0643\u0631]]\n[[es:Quackerjack]]\n[[fi:Kaakatti]]\n[[it:Quackerjack]]\n[[pl:Szafranek]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Clowns]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]"
