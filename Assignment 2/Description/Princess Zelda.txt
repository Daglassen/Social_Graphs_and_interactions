With the exception of {{LA}}, {{MM}}, and {{TFH}}, an incarnation of Zelda or one of her alter egos has always been one of the central characters in the series.\n\n{{OTOC}}\n\n==Physical traits==\nPrincess Zelda is often shown as a beautiful and elegant princess, with the exception of {{SS}}, where she is portrayed as an ordinary girl before the kingdom of Hyrule had been established. She is always either a child, teen, or young adult. Her hair color is depicted as blonde in most games of the series, as well as brown in {{TP}} and red in {{TLoZ}} and {{TAoL}}. Her eyes are portrayed in different shades of blue throughout all the games, with the exception of her green eyes in {{BotW}}. Her ears are always pointed, as is characteristic of all [[Hylian]]s, although in some games her ears are shorter than in others. The dresses that she wears are long with determinate colors, such as different tones of pink, white, and blue. Most of her dresses are shown with the [[Hylian Crest]], and in almost every game, she is seen wearing a tiara with either a red, pink, or blue jewel in it. In some games, she also wears long gloves. Princess Zelda is seen wearing makeup in most games, such as in {{TWW}} and {{ST}}, and her hairstyle is characterized either with her hair down or with braids. She wears high heels, although in {{TP|-}}, {{SS|-}}, and {{BotW|-}} she wears boots. She also occasionally wears sandals, such as in {{SS|-}} and {{BotW|-}}. Each incarnation of Zelda has been shown at various ages depending on which title they appear in. They have appeared as a child, a teenager and as a young adult; for example, the Princess Zelda in {{TP}} is around 20 years of age.<ref>{{Cite Guide|quote= |game= TP |publisher= Prima |page= 16}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:Zelda_from_Mirage_Castle's_Battle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Princess Zelda from Mirage Castle's Battle]]\nZelda is depicted as a kind and benevolent ruler with a wisdom beyond her years and a deep love towards the people she watches over. She is a caring, gracious, and self-sacrificing person.<ref>{{Cite|Everything that's happened to you and your poor sister... It's all been my fault....I'm so sorry.|Princess Zelda|TWW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|All the tragedy that has befallen Hyrule was my doing... I was so young...I could not comprehend the consequences of trying to control the Sacred Realm. I dragged you into it, too. Now it is time for me to make up for my mistakes...|Princess Zelda|OoT}}</ref> Zelda's most prominent display of compassion and selflessness was when she saved the life of [[Midna]], the Princess of the [[Twilight Realm]], who had been nearly killed by the false King of the Twilight, [[Zant]].<ref name=\"Midna\">{{Cite|Despite your mortal injuries, you act in our stead... These dark times are the result of our deeds, yet it is you who have reaped the penalty. Accept this now, Midna. I pass it to you...|Princess Zelda|TP}}</ref> Zelda's wisdom is her most valuable attribute. As a matriarch, it is imperative that she makes the wisest decision concerning the fate of Hyrule; in {{TP}} when Zant threatened her life and the lives of all of her subjects, she wisely surrendered to him.<ref name=\"Surrender\">{{Cite|It is time for you to choose: surrender or die. Oh yes, a question for all the land and people of Hyrule... Life? or Death?!|Zant|TP}}</ref> She upholds her responsibilities no matter the cost and is always willing to help her friends, such as in {{SS}}, where Zelda faces her duties as the goddess reborn and willingly remains in a deep sleep to keep [[Demise]] imprisoned within his seal.<ref name=\"DemiseSeal\">{{Cite|We must stop him from freeing himself from the seal that imprisons him. At any cost... That is why I intend to remain here in this time and place... To sustain the seal as best as I can. As long as I continue this vigil, we may be able to prevent the demon king from fully reviving himself in our own time.|Zelda|SS}}</ref> Above all, Zelda is known to be a forgiving person even towards those who have harmed her before, as seen in {{ST}}, where she asks [[Anjean]] to take care of [[Byrne]] even though he was the one who stole her body.<ref>{{Cite|Please make sure Byrne remains unharmed, Anjean.|Princess Zelda|ST}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Are you sure, my dear? He is the one who stole your body, after all.|Anjean|ST}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Yes, but once I reclaim it...  I would like to have words with him!|Princess Zelda|ST}}</ref>\n\nPrincess Zelda is one of the three most important characters of {{TLoZ|-}} series, which is also why her name appears in the title of every game. Princess Zelda first appeared in the original {{TLoZ}}, and has since been featured in every subsequent game, with the exception of {{LA}}. Each incarnation of the Princess is chosen by destiny to be the keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom in their respective eras, which is the main reason why they play such an integral role in the legends of Hyrule.\n\nby the way, In Game Book \"[[The Legend of Zelda: Battle of Mirage Castle|Battle of Mirage Castle]]\", it is nighttime and you will take the place of Link who is trapped in the Crystal Moon, but only Link can enter the Mirage Castle.\n\n==Abilities==\n[[File:Tp lightarrow1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Princess Zelda calls upon the power of the Light Spirits in {{TP|-}}]]\nThroughout the series, Princess Zelda portrays various types of both magical and physical abilities, ranging from capably wielding a bow<ref name=\"Bow\">{{Cite|I'll use this bow to cover you! Attack him as best you can!|Princess Zelda|TWW}}</ref> to telepathy, as seen in {{ALttP|-}}'s introduction when she pleads for Link's help.<ref name=\"Plead\">{{Cite manual|quote=One night, a girl's voice awakens you from your sleep. She telepathically pleads. \"Help me... My name is Zelda... I am in the castle dungeon.\"|page=7|game= ALttP}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in the [[Zelda Timeline|timeline of the series]], the original Zelda, while born as a Hylian, is the mortal incarnation of the [[Hylia|Goddess Hylia]].<ref name=\"Reborn\">{{Cite|You are the chosen hero, and I, Zelda... I am the goddess reborn as a mortal.|Zelda|SS}}</ref> Carrying on this divine blood, her female descendants are always the {{Wp|Crown prince|crown princess}} of [[Hyrule]] throughout its history.<ref name=\"Seventh Sage\"/><ref>{{Cite manual|quote=Princess Zelda / The princess of Hyrule and a longtime friend of Link.|game=The Minish Cap|page=5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite manual|quote=Princess Zelda / The King's daughter, Hyrule's princess.|game=Ocarina of Time|page=7}}</ref><ref name=\"Fragments\">{{Cite manual|quote=Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon.|game=The Legend of Zelda|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"True Heir\">{{Cite|You are the true heir of the royal family of Hyrule...the last link in the bloodline.|Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule|TWW}}</ref> Several princesses within the bloodline are also the possessor of the [[Triforce of Wisdom]], imbued with the essence of the Goddess [[Nayru (Goddess)|Nayru]].<ref name=\"Seventh Sage\"/><ref name=\"Special Powers\">{{Cite|Like you, I have been granted special powers by the goddesses...|Princess Zelda|TP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|This necklace you wear is part of a sacred treasure called the Triforce of Wisdom, which has been passed down for many ages within the royal family of Hyrule.|Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule|TWW}}</ref> The essence of Nayru affords each Zelda divine wisdom, allowing them to discern the wisest decisions, especially in situations concerning the welfare of Hyrule. It grants them myriad mystical abilities, including the ability to heal others, though there is a possibility that this could also be an effect of their bloodline passing down Hylia's own powers and, later, the [[Light Force]]. Each incarnation of Zelda uses their powers to keep evil in check.\n\nMany of her abilities as both a Sage and the wielder of the Triforce of Wisdom are widely illustrated in {{OoT|-}}, one of them being that she has prophetic visions in her dreams.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, have you heard that Princess Zelda sees prophetic visions in her dreams?|Hylian|OoT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I had a dream... In the dream, dark storm clouds were billowing over the land of Hyrule... But suddenly, a ray of light shot out of the forest, parted the clouds and lit up the ground... The light turned into a figure holding a green and shining stone, followed by a fairy... I know this is a prophecy that someone would come from the forest...|Princess Zelda|OoT}}</ref> She also helps Link in their escape from [[Ganon's Castle]] by using her powers to magically remove the barriers blocking the exits. During the final battle between Link and Ganon, Princess Zelda uses her powers to restrain the King of Evil as Link delivers the final blow.<ref>{{Cite|I'm using my power to hold the Evil King! You use your sword and deliver the final blow!|Princess Zelda|OoT}}</ref> Being the seventh [[Sage]], she is the ruler of the rest of the six Sages, and it is with her guidance that the Sages seal Ganon in the void of the [[Sacred Realm#Ocarina of Time|Evil Realm]].<ref name=\"Seventh Sage\"/><ref>{{Cite|Six Sages... Now!!|Princess Zelda|OoT}}</ref> Finally, with her powers as a Sage, she is capable of returning Link to his original time by simply using the [[Ocarina of Time (Item)|Ocarina of Time]].<ref>{{Cite|Link, give the Ocarina to me... As a Sage, I can return you to your original time with it.|Princess Zelda|OoT}}</ref>\n\nSome of Princess Zelda's physical abilities are demonstrated in games such as {{TWW}}, {{TP}} and {{ST}}. In {{TWW|-}}, Princess Zelda aids Link in battling Ganondorf by borrowing the young hero's bow and using it to fire [[Light Arrow]]s at the King of the Gerudo.<ref name=\"Bow\"/> This skill is again portrayed in the final battle of {{TP|-}}, where the princess yet again uses a bow and Light Arrows to strike Ganondorf while accompanying Link on his horse,<ref name=\"Light Arrows\">{{Cite|I'll try to slow Ganondorf with my light arrows! You target him and keep him within range of my arrows!|Princess Zelda|TP}}</ref> and once more in the final battle against [[Malladus]] in {{ST|-}}. In one scene of {{TP|-}}, Princess Zelda is seen wielding a sword, although it is unknown if she possesses any true sword skills.\n\nAs shown in {{TP|-}}, Princess Zelda is capable of communicating with the [[Light Spirits]]. Just as the princess and Link are about to be trampled by Ganondorf's ghostly army, Zelda calls upon the Light Spirits to aid her in her time of need, and the spirits grant her the Light Arrow to banish evil.<ref name=\"Spirits\">{{Cite|Spirits of the light! Wielders of the great power that shines far and wide upon the lands of our world... In my hour of need, grant me the light to banish evil!|Princess Zelda|OoT}}</ref>\n\nIn {{ST|-}}, Princess Zelda can possess a {{Term|ST|Phantom|link}}'s body after Link strikes it with a powered-up sword or the [[Lokomo Sword]]. While in this state, the princess can help Link solve various puzzles as well as cross certain obstacles that the young hero cannot traverse by himself.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, look! Now that I'm a Phantom, I can walk through fire and lava! Hee hee hee! I'm like a walking, talking shield, Link!|Princess Zelda|ST}}</ref> Moreover, due to the Phantom's armor, she can also protect Link from attacks or use her strength to fight alongside Link and help him defeat enemies, as seen when fighting [[Geozard]]s or [[Byrne]].\n\nIn the Game Book \"Battle of Mirage Castle\", it has the same abilities as Link.\n\n==Naming Tradition and Law==\n===Origin===\nIt was revealed by {{HH}} that when the kingdom of Hyrule was established during the [[Era of Prosperity]], the daughters of the Royal Family were often named Zelda after their ancestor, the [[Princess Zelda#Skyward Sword|mortal incarnation of the Goddess Hylia]], from the events of {{SS|-}}.<ref name=\"Lineage\">{{Cite Book|quote= |book= HH |publisher= |page= 77}}</ref>\n\n===The Tragedy of \"Princess Zelda I\"===\n[[File:TAoL Princess Zelda Sleeping Sprite.png|left]]\nWhile she was not the first Princess Zelda in the history of Hyrule, she was the first in a long line of princesses to be named Zelda by law and not tradition after she was put into a deep sleep for many generations. Her brother, the [[Prince of Hyrule]] at the end of its [[Golden Era]], who was partly to blame for her comatose state, decided that, in honor of his sister, every princess born into the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]] should be named Zelda.<ref name=\"Tragedy\">{{Cite manual|quote= In his grief, the prince placed the princess in this room. He hoped that someday she would come back to life. So that this tragedy would never be forgotten, he ordered that every female child born into the royal household shall be given the name Zelda.|game= TAoL|page= 8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= HH |publisher= |page= 105}}</ref>\n\n==Unified Timeline==\n==={{SS|-}}===\n[[File:SS Loftwing Artwork.png|right|150px|link=Special:FilePath/SS_Loftwing_Artwork.png]]\nThe Zelda in {{SS}} is the eleventh Zelda appearing in the {{TLoZ|-}} series, and is currently the earliest incarnation of Zelda chronologically to appear in-game.\n\nIn {{SS|-}}, Zelda, daughter of [[Gaepora]], lives in [[Skyloft]] with her childhood friend [[Link]],<ref>{{Cite|You've been friends since you were kids? Big deal. It doesn't change the fact that you float through life with your head in the clouds.|Groose|SS}}</ref> where they are both students at the [[Knight Academy]].<ref>{{Cite|He's a student at the academy, like all of us.|Zelda|SS}}</ref> After playing the role of the [[Hylia|goddess]] at the [[Wing Ceremony]], Link and Zelda go for a flight together, when suddenly a twister pulls Zelda and her [[Loftwing]] below the clouds. This phenomenon is later revealed to have been caused by [[Ghirahim]], who needs Zelda's soul to resurrect [[Demise]], his master.<ref>{{Cite|I thought that tornado I stirred up would have tossed and torn you apart, yet here you are. Not in pieces.|Ghirahim|SS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|But the past...oh, the past... So full of possibilities. I shall resurrect him there with the divine soul of this golden-haired girl!|Ghirahim|SS}}</ref> Upon Zelda's arrival on [[Hyrule|the Surface]], however, she is rescued by [[Impa]] before the Demon Lord can capture her.<ref>{{Cite|The one you saw by Zelda's side is known as Impa. She is a being sent forth by the goddess to aid Zelda in her quest.|Impa|SS}}</ref> Link then begins to look for Zelda and eventually finds her in the [[Earth Spring]], but Impa impedes him from reaching the young girl,<ref>{{Cite|You cannot go to him, Your Grace. Remember what we discussed. Restrain yourself. Focus on the task at hand.|Impa|SS}}</ref> and instead urges Zelda to continue praying at each goddess statue to finish purifying her body.<ref>{{Cite|I set out to pray at the goddess statues located in each temple across the land. Each statue stirred up memories within me. After I visited them all, Impa, an agent of the goddess, led me here...to the past.|Zelda|SS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|The spirit maiden who descended from the clouds must travel to two sacred places to purify her body.|Fi|SS}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Zelda Skyward Sword.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Zelda, as seen in-game]]\nEventually, Link catches up with Zelda and Impa at the [[Temple of Time]], but their reunion is cut short when Ghirahim attacks the duo. In the midst of the frenetic action, Zelda gives Link the [[Goddess's Harp]] before she and Impa escape through the [[Gate of Time]], with Impa destroying the gate to escape Ghirahim's grasp. Link manages to activate a second Gate of Time and meets with Zelda, who explains her true nature as the mortal reincarnation of the Goddess Hylia before telling Link that she,<ref name=\"Reborn\"/> as Hylia reborn, must remain in a deep sleep to keep Demise imprisoned within his seal.<ref name=\"DemiseSeal\"/> Before doing so, Zelda explains that the goddess needed someone with an \"unbreakable spirit\" to defeat Demise.<ref>{{Cite|To face Demise and bring hope back to the land, the goddess Hylia needed someone with an unbreakable spirit. That someone is you, [Link].|Zelda|SS}}</ref> However, Hylia, knowing that the young hero would \"throw [himself] headfirst into any danger, without even a moment's doubt\" if it meant saving Zelda,<ref>{{Cite|I knew that if it meant saving Zelda, you would throw yourself headfirst into any danger, without even a moment's doubt... I... I used you.|Zelda|SS}}</ref> used Link to try and bring about the destruction of Demise. She proceeds to seal herself into a crystal and sleep for thousands of years to ensure Demise's seal holds, and tells Link that he must find and use the Triforce to destroy Demise so that she will be able to wake up in their own time.<ref>{{Cite|When Demise is finally gone, there will be no more need for the seal that binds him, and then I'll be able to wake up.|Zelda|SS}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Link uses the [[Triforce]] to wish for Demise's destruction, [[Ghirahim]] kidnaps Zelda upon her awakening and takes her through the Gate of Time, where Demise is still sealed.<ref>{{Cite|It's best for everyone if you forget about your friend. The little goddess is mine now! My master may have perished in this age, but in the past he lives yet! I'm taking the girl back through that gate to help me revive the demon king!|Ghirahim|SS}}</ref> Zelda's soul is absorbed and Demise is revived in his true form,<ref>{{Cite|Ah... But never mind that. Victory is still mine to savor. While we fought, the ritual I started continued... At last, it's complete! The demon king shall devour the soul of the goddess and resurrect in his full glory!|Ghirahim|SS}}</ref> but Link manages to defeat the Demon King and seal his remains in the [[Master Sword]]. After her soul is restored, Zelda and the young hero return to their own time, where she mentions to Link that she wants to remain in the surface and watch over the Triforce. Zelda asks what Link's intentions are for the future,<ref>{{Cite|Look around us! As a child, I always dreamed of a world below. I wanted to see the surface with my own eyes and feel the land's warm breeze on my skin. I... I think I want to live here. I always want to feel solid ground beneath my feet, see the clouds above my head, and watch over the Triforce.|Zelda|SS}}</ref> and Link smiles at her, with the camera panning to show both his and Zelda's Loftwings flying back into the sky, implying that Link chose to stay with Zelda.\n\nThis incarnation of Zelda is unique in that she is not a princess during the course of the game's events.\n\n{{Fi|Zelda|This is '''Zelda''', your childhood friend.

One day, she witnesses a mysterious and brilliant light in the sky to the east. Aginah, the younger brother of the wise man Sahasrahla and now living in his old hideout near the Eastern Palace also witnesses such a light, and travels to investigate. There he finds a strange youth lying on the ground. Zelda, also following the light, meets up with Aginah, and they both carry the child to rest in Sahasrahla's hideout. Confused by the youth's unusual clothes, they believe the child not to hail from Kakariko Village. Speaking to Aginah while the youngster sleeps, Zelda learns that his brother Sahasrahla had also sensed danger surrounding Hyrule and had left the land to find the hero, Link. While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light. Zelda then sets of for Hyrule Castle before sending Aginah to find the Book of Mudora while she speaks to the Fortune Teller. Aginah and the hero travel to the Sanctuary at the foot of the mountain, but Zelda follows, claiming she had another prophetic dream, this time of her holding the Book of Mudora on top of Death Mountain. Zelda insists on traveling with the hero to the summit of the mountain, as she is the only one who can read the Book of Mudora. During their quest to obtain the final two tablets and reach the summit, the Fortune Teller sees the King of Evil in a vision. Ganon's malice had kept his spirit alive despite the destruction of his body. It was this lingering evil power that had drawn the Hero of Light into the land of Hyrule, and upon the summit the hero travels once more into another world to engage in a desperate final battle with the Demon King in a new version of Ganon's Tower. Ganon desires the power of the Hero of Light to be fully reborn, but is finally destroyed using the Silver Arrows once more.\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n==={{ALBW|-}}===\n{{Stub|ALBW}}\n[[File:ALBW Princess Zelda 01.png|right|thumb|Zelda in {{ALBW|-}}]]\nThe Zelda in {{ALBW}} is the twelfth Zelda in the {{TLoZ|-}} series, and the second Zelda chronologically in the Fallen Hero Timeline.\n\nZelda appears again in {{ALBW}}.

After Link managed to disable Calamity Ganon's most powerful form, Dark Beast Ganon, she was freed, and proceeded to destroy Calamity Ganon's essence.

She eventually ended up separated from Link, and witnessed the corpse revive itself via the malice.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Main|Princess Zelda/Other Appearances}}\nPrincess is also featured in other media, including comics based on the games, animated shows, and the [[ssb:Super Smash Bros. (series)|{{SSBS|-}}]]. In some of her appearances, she is depicted as a brave, proud, and self-reliant fighter who is proficient in archery and horseback riding, such as in the {{TLoZ|Valiant Comics}} and {{TLoZ|TV Series}}. As with the games, she is the protector of the Triforce of Wisdom.\n\n==Alter Egos==\n===Sheik===\n[[File:OoT Sheik Artwork.png|100px|left]]\n{{Main|Sheik}}\nIn {{OoT|-}}, Link met up with a mysterious member of the [[Sheikah]] Tribe, fittingly called Sheik. This person taught [[Link]] a multitude of different songs and gave him tips on how to proceed in his quest. At the end of the game, Sheik revealed himself to be none other than Princess Zelda in a disguise.<ref name=\"Seventh Sage\"/> During the seven years Link had been asleep while maturing to become ready to fight [[Ganondorf]], Zelda had gone underground and taken the disguise as Sheik so that Ganondorf would not find her in his search for the two remaining pieces of the [[Triforce]], one which was held by Princess Zelda herself.<ref name=\"Disguise\"/><ref name=\"Sheikah\"/>\n\nSheik is also a playable character in {{SSBM|-}} and {{SSBB|-}}: Zelda is able to transform into Sheik during a battle, allowing her to use a different set of moves.\n[[File:TWWHD Tetra Artwork.png|100px|right]]\n\n===Tetra===\n{{Main|Tetra}}\nBorn into a society of pirates on the Great Sea, Tetra, captain of a [[Tetra's Pirate Crew|crew of pirates]], was completely unaware that she was a member of the Royal Family of Hyrule's bloodline.<ref name=\"Orphan\"/><ref name=\"Reveal\"/> When this was revealed to her by [[Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule]], she was just as surprised as Link to find out that she was indeed a descendant of Princess Zelda of Hyrule and also the one destined to be the keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom.<ref name=\"True Heir\"/>\n\n===Leader of the Sages===\nIn {{OoT}}, Zelda is revealed to be the seventh [[Sage]] and the leader of them all.<ref name=\"Seventh Sage\"/> Though no conclusive evidence has been sighted, Zelda is often seen as the proverbial [[Sage#Theories|Sage of Time]], via several events that occur in {{OoT|-}}.\n\n===Goddess Hylia===\n{{Main|Hylia}}\nBefore the events of {{SS}}, a goddess named Hylia defeated [[Demise]].

In the {{Term|TMC|Minish Legend}}, a hero clad in green clothes, the [[Hero of Men]] arose to fight the demons attacking the world. This story of the {{Term|TMC|Minish Legend}} is depicted in a series of stained glass windows beneath the [[Elemental Sanctuary]]. One of the stained glass windows depicts a Princess of Hyrule wielding the [[Light Force]]. Using the stained glass window, [[Vaati]] is able to deduce that the Light Force is currently held by the current Princess Zelda.\n\n===Antediluvian Princess===\n:''See also: [[Tetra's Pirate Crew]]''\nIn {{TWW}}, when Link travels to [[Hyrule Castle]] beneath the [[Great Sea]], there is a portrait of the Princess of Hyrule (around the age of [[Tetra]]) from before the [[Great Flood]] hanging on the wall of the castle. In the portrait, the princess is surrounded by several characters, all of which have a counterpart to a member of [[Tetra's Pirate Crew]]. It is known that during the Great Flood, she took a piece of the [[Triforce of Wisdom]] which had been broken in two by her [[Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule|father]] and fled to the mountaintops with several of her servants.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= HH |publisher= |page= 123}}</ref>\n\n===Ten Thousands Years prior to {{BotW}}===\n[[File:Zelda 10000 years ago.png|left|140px|thumb|The Princess of Hyrule from 10,000 years ago]]\nLearned by [[Impa]] and [[Kass]], the Zelda that lived ten thousand years prior to the events of {{BotW|-}} assisted Link and the four [[Champion]]s in defending Hyrule from Calamity Ganon.

In some cases<!--which-->, she is also able to summon a magical bow made from pure light in order to fire the arrows.\n\nIn {{HW}}, the magical bow and light arrows can be summoned as part of Zelda's combos and special attacks while wielding her rapiers.<!--does the 8-Bit White Sword modify these at all?-->\n\n===Rapier===\nIn {{TP}}, Zelda carries an ornate rapier, seemingly as a {{wp|sword of state}}. When possessed by [[Ganondorf]], she also uses it as a weapon against Link.\n\nIn {{HW}}, this rapier is named the \"Polished Rapier\", and is one of several rapiers the princess can use, alongside the more ornate Glittering Rapier, the extravagant Gleaming Rapier, which also bears the royal crest, and the humorous 8-Bit [[White Sword]], a joke weapon.\n\n===Baton===\nWhile Zelda does not wield the [[Wind Waker (Item)|Wind Waker]] in its titular introduction, {{TWW}}, it is claimed to be an instrument of the royal family used by the monarch in conducting the [[Sage]]s.\n\nIn {{HW}}, Zelda is able to use the Wind Waker to conduct magical songs that summon wind and lightning. She can also use the Sacred Baton, which resembles a crystallized gust of wind, and the Glorious Baton, which resembles a [[Great Fairy]]'s locks of hair.\n\n==Trivia==\n*{{LA}} and {{TFH}} are the only games where {{Term|Series|Princess Zelda}}'s presence is completely absent. However, Link mentions her at the beginning of {{LA|-}}.<ref name=\"Marin\"/><ref name=\"Marin 2\"/> {{Term|Series|Princess Zelda}}'s clothing, the {{Term|TFH|Legendary Dress|link}}, also appears in {{TFH|-}}, which is based on its design from {{ALBW}}.\n*{{BotW|-}} is the first main series game to supply {{Term|BotW|Princess Zelda}} with English voice acting.

It is technically also the second main series game to supply full voice acting overall, with the ''[[Navi Trackers]]'' mode for the Japanese version of {{FSA}} being the first with Zelda's alter-ego [[Tetra]].\n*What Zelda says to Link regarding his memories and courage immediately prior to the final battle with Ganon in {{BotW|-}} varied between languages. In the Japanese version, Zelda states that she believes in Link and his courage regardless of whether he regained his memories,<ref>{{Cite|{{Romanize|\u3067\u3082\u79c1\u306f\u8cb4\u65b9\u3092\u2026\u3000\u8cb4\u65b9\u306e\u52c7\u6c17\u3092\u4fe1\u3058\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01|Demo watakushi wa anata o \u2026 anata no y\u016bki o shinji te i masu!|But I believe in you... in your courage!|3}}|Zelda|BotW|Japanese version}}</ref> while in the English localization, she instead states that courage doesn't need to be remembered due to one never forgetting the concept in the first place.<ref>{{Cite|But courage need not be remembered... for it is never forgotten.|Zelda|BotW}}</ref>\n*During the final battle with {{Term|OoT|Ganon}} in {{OoT}} and its remake {{OoT3D}}, whenever {{Term|OoT|Link}} ends up hit by one of Ganon's attacks, {{Term|OoT|Princess Zelda}} can be heard gasping in horror.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated that the Princess Zelda's name originated from Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of the acclaimed author, F.
