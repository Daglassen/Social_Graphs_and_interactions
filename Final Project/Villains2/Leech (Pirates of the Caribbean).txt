He appeared in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''.\n\n==Background==\nLeech is shown to have an ungrateful attitude to Jack's lack of leadership for leading them into danger. Despite his displeased attitude, he mistakenly let the ''Pearl'' only have six crewmen.\n\n==Role in the film==\nWhen the crew of the ''Black Pearl'' landed on the island of [[Pelegosto]], Leech was among the surviving members who were imprisoned in bone cages made from the crew members who had become the natives' victims. The crew swung the cages until they finally grabbed ahold of the vines and roots and used them to scale the cliffs. [[Will Turner]] called that it would take the lot of them to crew the ''Black Pearl'', but Leech said that about six would do before catching onto his mistake. Then Will, Leech, and the groups in the cages starting putting more effort to climb to beat the other to the top.\n\nWill suddenly spotted a lone Pelegosto warrior walking on the bridge nearby and told everyone to stop. Leech decided to take advantage of the situation and continued to silently climb with his group, completely ignoring Will's warning. While Leech was climbing, he grabbed a snake by mistake and called out in fright. This caused such a panic in the cage that its captives let go of the vines they were holding onto. The cage lurched downward with such force that it actually caused the supporting rope to snap at the top. Leech and his would-be mutineers plummeted to their doom.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4257.jpg\npirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4279.jpg\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4280.jpg\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4332.jpg|\"Shh...\"\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4336.jpg\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4347.jpg\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4355.jpg\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4361.jpg|\"Snake!\"\npirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4369.jpg\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-4384.jpg|Leech and his would-be mutineers fall to their death.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to the audio commentary by [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], many lines given to Leech are actually unused lines that would have been spoken by [[Joshamee Gibbs]] in the final version of ''Dead Man's Chest''.\n*In an early script, he was named \"'''Leach'''\" and his death would feature him after [[Will Turner]]'s cage reached the top of the cliff, only for Leech to grab the vine that is actually a snake and later fell to his death in the final version of the film. He is the only member of the crew in the cage in Pelegostos whose name is revealed.\n*Strangely, Leech does not appear in ''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]'' at all.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Leech Leech] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Leech}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
