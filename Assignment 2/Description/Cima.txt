How strange...|Cima|BotW}}</ref> She thanks Link for his help, giving him a {{Term|BotW|Rubber Helm|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks for looking into it for me! Here's something for your trouble.|Cima|BotW}}</ref> Cima is relieved to finally be able to relax.<ref>{{Cite|I can finally relax!|Cima|BotW}}</ref> This completes the Side Quest.\n\nCima will ask Link if he's seen the {{Plural|BotW|Waterfall|link}} leading into {{Term|BotW|Lake Floria|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Did you check out the falls at Lake Floria? There are 10 different falls there, big and small!|Cima|BotW}}</ref> She claims each one is unique and worth seeing.<ref>{{Cite|Each one is unique and absolutely worth a look.|Cima|BotW}}</ref> While she's going to sleep, she tells Link to wait for whatever he needs until tomorrow.<ref>{{Cite|Did you need something?
