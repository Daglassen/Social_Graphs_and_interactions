== Biography ==
Emri is a merchant found managing a small Fruit shop in the Kara Kara Bazaar}. She is an elderly Gerudo with a grumpy attitude. She sells Mighty Bananas, Hydromelons, and Palm Fruits.
Emri tells Link that she offers more Hydromelons than one could find in Gerudo Town. Emri also says that it is foolish to cross the Gerudo Desert without cooling Food. She doesn't see what's so amazing about the Desert. If Link speaks to Emri with the Gerudo Set on, she calls him an oddball for wanting to wear Gerudo outfits.
Emri complains when Link buys a small amount of produce, saying he should buy them all at once. However, when Link buys out one of Emri's products, she complains that she'll have to get more. If Link declines to make a purchase, Emri tells him to leave if he's going to jerk her around.
Link can sell Items to Emri, though she complains about it and tells him to hurry up. She continuously asks if he's done yet. After Link is finished selling, Emri says that she wishes he would sell his items somewhere else next time.
If Link speaks to Emri while searching for the man who discovered a way into Gerudo Town, Emri says that Link has a look on his face like he needs to talk to her. If Link exits the conversation, she asks what his deal is, but is glad that she is not getting dragged into the drama. When Link asks about suspicious merchants, Emri thinks for a moment and says that every merchant that is not a Gerudo is suspicious to her. Emri then remembers a particular person and tells Link of a female merchant who frequents the general store. However, Emri says that she is not going to poke her nose in someone's business and finishes speaking.
