Aji is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Aji is a Goron who runs the Protein Palace shop in Goron City. He sells a small selection of grilled Foods that were Cooked upon a heated stone slab. Aji admits that since Gorons normally only eat rocks, the shop is mainly intended for tourists visiting the City. However, because it is possible to grill Foods just by placing them on the ground due to the intense heat, he also laments that his shop has been losing customers as a result. If Link decides to buy something, Aji becomes extremely shocked, as he hasn't had a customer in a very long time. He'll also allow Link to sell items to him.
Like most merchants with tables, such as Fyson or Pelison, if Link stands on the cooking platform, he looks comically surprised, a text box appearing over his head asking that Link get down. Speaking to him in this state has him beg Link to get down or question Link's upbringing and lack of manners. It is also possible to cook food by placing it on top of the cooking platform, similar to in a campfire or the rest of Death Mountain.
