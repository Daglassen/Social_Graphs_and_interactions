Tarzan refuses to help him because of the danger of the task, but Rokoff threatens to kill Jane if he doesn't. His intellectual battle with Tarzan goes like a chess game until Tarzan finally releases the last few leopards from the boarded up cave on him. It is unclear if they kill Rokoff or not.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nRokoff1.jpg|Rokoff getting a treasure map from an old sailor\nRokoff2.jpg|Rokoff's map stolen by Manu\nRokoff3.jpg|Rokoff meeting [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]]\nRokoff4.jpg|Rokoff and Tarzan playing chess\nRokoff5.jpg|Rokoff threatening Tarzan\nRokoff6.jpg|Rokoff threatening Jane\nRokoff7.jpg|Rokoff attacked by Manu 1\nRokoff8.jpg|Rokoff attacked by Manu 2\nRokoff9.jpg|Rokoff forcing Tarzan to give him the treasure\nRokoff10.jpg|Rokoff's defeat (and possible death)\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n*Nikolas Rokoff is a recurring character from the original Tarzan novels. He had a sister who was a countess whom he plotted against and had an assistant named Alexis Paulvitch. Just like in the series, Rokoff loses his life. The character also served as a loose inspiration for [[Clayton]].\n*Rokoff bears a striking resemblance to [[Gaston]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.\n\n{{Tarzan}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rokoff, Nikolas}}\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
