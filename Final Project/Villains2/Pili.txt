He also appears uncaring as he didn't care that the Chiki Chiki got caught.\n\n==Role in the series==\nPili makes his first appearance in \"[[The Last Laugh]]\", when he and [[Chatana]] are unintentionally released by [[Elena Flores|Elena]] and [[Mateo]]. Pili's ready to exact revenge, but Chatana quiets him saying they must find her diadem.\n\nLater on, Chatana and Pili join forces with [[Ash Delgado|Ash]] and [[Chancellor Esteban|Esteban]].\n\nIn \"[[Giant Steps]]\", they recruit [[Tziloco]] into their group. Pili also expresses a dislike for Chatana's strongest monster Kizin, and is not deterred by the group's failure to have him join them.\n\nIn \"[[Coronation Day]]\", Pili is still with the rest of Ash's villainous group when she declares her intention to free the [[Four Shades of Awesome|Shadows of the Night]], whom Chatana and Tziloco manage to unravel are imprisoned in the gateway to the Spirit World that is near Nueva Vista. Esteban teleports them there, but just as Ash is about to release the Shadows, the group is confronted by Elena and her friends. After [[Princess Isabel]] shrinks a giant jellyfish monster Chatana created, Pili attempts to spit fire at her, only to be frozen into an ice statue by Mateo and taken to Avalor alongside Chatana and Tziloco to be imprisoned in the dungeon.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nChatana & Pili.jpg\nChatana shuts up Pili.jpg\nMateo freezes Fuli.jpg\nChatana 02.png\nChatana 017.jpg\nChatana 015.jpg\nChatana 014.jpg\nChatana 013.jpg\nChatana 012.jpg\nChatana-Ash 01.jpg\nChatana 02.jpg\nChatana 08.jpg\nChatana 06.jpg\nChatana 05.jpg\nChatana 04.jpg\nChatana 03.jpg\nAsh-Chatana 02.jpg\nAsh-Chatana 01.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Weasels]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
