He appeared for the first time in the Danish story \"Deck Us All!\", where he is shown as a close friend of Jones. Nevertheless, this fellowship was not explored in any of Woimly's later stories. Woimly is always smoking a cigar like the original Pete used to do. He became a relatively important rival to Donald Duck. Woimly likes to provoke Donald by showing unbearable arrogance when they are in some contest against each other.\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]"
