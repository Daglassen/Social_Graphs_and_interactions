She is a hypnotist.\n\n==Background==\nHypnotheria was once a promising doctoral candidate seeking degrees in royal European history and applied hypnosis. But she became overly ambitious, and after years of researching dual doctorates, she came to believe that she should become queen. Hypnotheria turned to a criminal life and started using her hypnotic powers for evil. Overall, she would make the State her own place of rule.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nHypnotheria (001).png\nHypnotheria (002).png\nHypnotheria (003).png\nHypnotheria (004).png\nHypnotheria (005).png\nHypnotheria (006).png\nHypnotheria (007).png\nHypnotheria (008).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
