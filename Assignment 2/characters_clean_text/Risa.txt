Risa is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Risa is a Gerudo who attends Ashai's relationship class. If Link speaks to Risa during the class, she explains that she is only taking the class to refresh her knowledge. During Ashai's relationship class, Ashai asks the class what to do in multiple different situations. Risa is always the third to stand up and answer, after Pasha and Dina; the former two provide practical answers, in contrast to Risa, who comes up with rather radical solutions. One example is what they'd do when a "handsome voe" approaches them on the street. Risa is the last to stand up and share her solution, saying that she would attack the man when he least suspects it. Ashai dismisses Risa's solution and tells her that would be illegal. Another is if they were to find an wounded voe when out and about. Risa determines that she'd take him back to her in a covert manor, and assist him in rejuvenation, seemingly forgetting that his entry into her house is forbidden under Gerudo law. Ms. Ashai considers it touching, but laments that is can be considered kidnapping. The final event posed on the class is being erratically engaged in conversation with a voe whom they had been attempting to have notice them. Risa deduces that she'd have use sheer physical force to have said voe agree to espousal. Their teacher is naturally taken aback and suggests that they discuss this answer later.
