When {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} first approaches him, Reede notes that he must be an adventurer and introduces himself, asking Link what he thinks of the village.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, are you an adventurer? I am the head of Hateno Village. Call me Reede. Isn\u2019t this a peaceful place we have here, don\u2019t you think?|Reede|BotW}}</ref> If Link agrees that it is peaceful, Reede says they are recovering from the {{Term|BotW|Great Calamity|link}} at last.<ref>{{Cite|[Indeed.] Yes... We\u2019re finally feeling a bit of recovery from the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}}.|Reede|BotW}}</ref> Link can admit that he is uncomfortable in Hateno and Reede will laugh, claiming that the village has grown.<ref>{{Cite|[Not really...] Haha! This village looks like an urban center to you, eh? Well, Hateno Village has definitely grown in size recently now that we\u2019re recovering from the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}}.|Reede|BotW}}</ref> He ends the conversation by inviting the hero to stay for as long as he chooses.<ref>{{Cite|Our village is pleasant, peaceful, and has plenty of food to go around! Please stay as long as you like.|Reede|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can return to Reede and ask him about a number of subjects.<ref>{{Cite|Yes, yes... Can I help you with anything?|Reede|BotW}}</ref> Asking about the {{Term|BotW|Hateno Ancient Tech Lab|link}} leads him to direct Link to the hill where it sits.<ref>{{Cite|[...Ancient Tech Lab?] {{Color|BotW Blue|Hateno Ancient Tech Lab}}? Oh, sure! That\u2019s the {{Color|BotW Blue|building up on the top of that hill}}.|Reede|BotW}}</ref> Reede mentions that a {{Term|BotW|Purah|link|display = Sheikah tribe member}} conducts research there and never comes out.<ref>{{Cite|A person from the Sheikah tribe lives up there. You never know what they\u2019re diving into. They rarely come out lately, now that I think about it. They must be really busy lately... Seems at least one member of the Sheikah tribe has lived up there since the time of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}}. They call what goes on up there research, but I don\u2019t know what kind.|Reede|BotW}}</ref> He also expresses concern over the occupants' wellbeing.<ref>{{Cite|Those folks up there should get out more, y\u2019know? It\u2019s not healthy to stay cooped up all day!|Reede|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can ask about the Calamity itself and Reede will describe the torturous event, noting that even now it is difficult to speak of.<ref>{{Cite|[The Great Calamity?] It\u2019s hard to even talk about the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}}. It was a disastrous event that took place 100 years ago. Villages everywhere were burned. Many lives were lost...|Reede|BotW}}</ref> He advises Link to speak to the elders of the village to learn more about it, as Reede himself was not alive.<ref>{{Cite|That was all before I was born, of course. The elders here would know more.|Reede|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAsking him about Hateno Village itself allows Reede to explain that the settlement was rebuilt, having only just survived the ruin of the Great Calamity.<ref>{{Cite|[Hateno Village?] Hateno Village barely survived the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}}. The village was later rebuilt by {{Color|BotW Blue|Hylian}} hands.|Reede|BotW}}</ref> He mentions that many people now inhabit the village and they see a few travelers every-so-often.<ref>{{Cite|Now many people live here in peace amongst the shops. It\u2019s nice to see travelers stop by now and then as well.|Reede|BotW}}</ref>\n\nThe sign in front of his house has the word \"Mayor\" written on it in Hylian.{{Fact}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Reede's and Clavia's House.png|{{Term|BotW|Reede}} and {{Term|BotW|Clavia}}'s {{Term|BotW|House}}\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hateno Villagers, Hylians, Hyruleans, Mayors\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
