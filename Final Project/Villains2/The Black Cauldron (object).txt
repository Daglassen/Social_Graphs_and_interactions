Fueled by the spirit of the dark lord [[Arawn]], who was once an evil overlord who ruled over the land of [[Prydain]], the cauldron has the ability to raise the dead. During the prologue, the narrator talks about the history of the Black Cauldron and how the overlord came to become it.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Black Cauldron]] ''===\nAs stated in the prologue: \"Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain, there was once a king so cruel and so evil, that even the gods feared him. Since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron. There, his demonic spirit was captured in the form of a great Black Cauldron.\"\n\nThe face of the overlord is apparently engraved upon the cauldron. At certain points in the movie, the face is illuminated.\n\nFor uncounted centuries the cauldron remained hidden while evil beings searched for it. They knew that whoever owned it could rule the world and hatch an army of undead warriors. One of these beings was a wicked emperor known as the [[Horned King]], who sought to find the cauldron and use its power to unleash an army of deathless warriors.\n\n[[Taran]] traded his [[Magic Sword]] for the Cauldron in hopes to destroy it, but was told by the [[Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch|Witches of Morva]] that the Black Cauldron was indestructible. However, all of the Black Cauldron's evil powers could be undone if a soul willingly climbed into the cauldron at the cost of their own life. Taran's choice to find the cauldron was his biggest mistake when he and his companions were captured by the [[Horned King's guards]]. With the cauldron in his possession, the Horned King brought his [[Cauldron Born]] army to life and sent them to conquer all of Prydain.\n\nTaran attempted to sacrifice himself by jumping into the cauldron but [[Gurgi]] stopped him and made the sacrifice himself, and as a result, all of the cauldron's evil was undone, its power lost, killed the Horned King and destroyed the castle.\n\nThe cauldron was last seen floating in the water where Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch were waiting to take it but not before they bargained with Taran to return Gurgi.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]] ''===\nIn the House of Mouse episode \"[[House of Magic]]\", [[Daisy Duck]] accidentally makes the House of Mouse audience disappear. When they ask the [[Magic Mirror]] for help, he tells them to check the prop basement for something magical to help them. Daisy and Minnie find the Black Cauldron (a sign on it says: ''Who-So-Ever Uses the Black Cauldron for Evil Will be All Powerful'') and decide it's what they need.\n\nDaisy dresses as [[Maleficent]] and attempts to cast a spell. She ends up summoning the Cauldron Born instead. In order to make it go away, she casts a spell. However, in the process, she makes the whole House of Mouse disappear. After everything was set straight by [[Jafar]], Daisy attempts to use the Cauldron as a fondue pot, again summoning the Cauldron Born.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Halloween]]''===\nA cauldron similar to the Black Cauldron appears in this direct to DVD feature. However, this cauldron is in the possession of [[The Evil Queen|the Evil Queen]] and talks to her via magic. Each time it talks, it speaks in a male voice and tries to give ideas for the Queen. The first story told explains how this particular cauldron ended up in the Queen's dungeon, being one of the cauldrons that were owned by the Witches of Morva, which links it back to the Black Cauldron.\n\n===Other appearances===\n*The Black Cauldron has a minor cameo in the ''[[Tangled: The Series]]'' episode \"[[Keeper of the Spire]]\", as one of the framed items on the Spire's Vault wall.\n*For a brief moment in ''[[Descendants 3]]'', a slightly smaller to medium version of the Black Cauldron is seen as one of the exhibits at Auradon's Museum of Cultural History, during [[Audrey (Descendants)|Audrey]]'s [[Queen of Mean|solo song]], before and after, she takes [[Maleficent's Staff|Maleficent's sceptre]]. It appears again in the ''Descendants'' themed \"Date Night at the Museum\" ''[[Chibi Tiny Tales]]'' short when [[Carlos De Vil|Carlos]] tries bobbing for apples with it, which causes the Horned King to emerge and scare the teens.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe idea of an evil overlord ruling Prydain is not unfamiliar to the source material. In the books that the Black Cauldron was based on, the overlord is named Arawn, the Death-Lord of Annuvin. Arawn was originally to be the main villain of the Black Cauldron, just like in the books. However, Arawn was replaced by the Horned King because animators felt that audiences would like Horned King better because he had horns. Several people working on the film were discouraged about this because they had read the books and felt that you couldn't do the film based on the book without the book's main villain. The spirit in the cauldron is never named in the film, but it may have been a reference to Arawn.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nArawn.jpg|The overlord\u2019s face on the Cauldron\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-796.jpg|The cauldron in Hen Wen's vision.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-2721.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-6652.jpg\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-6732.jpg|Gurgi tries to climb in.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7150.jpg|The Horned King using the cauldron.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7175.jpg|Blood drips from the cauldron.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7181.jpg|The cauldron's foot claws at the floor.\nBlackcauldron1.jpg|The Cauldron's Power\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7222.jpg|The mist of undeath.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7228.jpg|The mist passes over the dead.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-7639.jpg|Gurgi's sacrifice.\nCauldron.png|Arawn's face glowing red\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-8073.jpg|The cauldron's power comes undone.\nBlack-cauldron-disneyscreencaps.com-8637.jpg|The cauldron gets taken by the Witches of Morva.\nDaisy Duck Black Cauldron zps85f7d532.jpg|Daisy looking through the Black Cauldron.\nMinnie Daisy Black Cauldron.jpg\nTangled Spire panorama.jpg|The cauldron in ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''.\nDVG Horned King.png\nDVG Our Hour Has Arrived.png\nDVG The Black Cauldron.jpg\nDVG The Power of the Black Cauldron.jpg\nBLACK MAGIC CAULDRON.png|as a badge in [[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]\n1990sVillainspostcard.jpeg\nFile:Chibi Tiny Tales Horned King.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The Black Cauldron is called \"Crochan\" in the original books. Instead of Gurgi, the one who sacrificed himself by plunging into it was Ellidyr, Son of Pen-Llarcau, who was a proud and glory-seeking prince. In place of the Magic Sword Dyrnwyn, Taran gave Adaon's brooch (which is a magical possession) to the Witches of Morva in exchange for the cauldron.\n\n{{The Black Cauldron}}\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Black Cauldron]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
