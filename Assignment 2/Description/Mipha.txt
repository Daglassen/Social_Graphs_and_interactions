She is described as being introverted and has a gift for healing. Mipha was in love with Link and made him [[Zora Armor]] before her death during the Great Calamity.<ref>{{Cite|He who stands here...the man called Link...is the one whom my sister, Mipha, had feelings for.|Sidon|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Countless generations of Zora princesses have gifted that armor to the one they have sworn to marry!

I never would have imagined she would make that special armor for one such as he...|Muzu|BotW}}</ref> Link later receives the armor from Mipha's father, [[King Dorephan]].<ref>{{Cite|Now then, allow me to offer you this gift as a show of faith.|King Dorephan|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|So long as you wear this, you can {{Color|BotW Red|ascend waterfalls}} just like a Zora.|King Dorephan|BotW}}</ref>\n\nMipha was a skilled spearwoman and owned a weapon known as the Lightscale Trident.<ref>{{Cite|A spear of peerless grace cherished by the Zora Champion Mipha.

[[Muzu]] was Mipha\u2019s teacher and cared for her greatly.<ref>{{Cite|You must understand... He was in charge of educating my dear daughter, Mipha.|King Dorephan|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Naturally, she means a lot to him...just as she means the world to us.|King Dorephan|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Calamity, Mipha succumbed to the Scourge of {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Ruta|link}}, [[Waterblight Ganon]], which then possessed the [[Divine Beast]]. After Link defeats Waterblight Ganon and frees Ruta, Mipha greets the hero, stating that because of his courage she and Vah Ruta are now free.<ref>{{Cite|Hello, Link. Because of your courage, my spirit is now free. And Ruta, as well...|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> She thanks Link for this freedom, for they can be together again.<ref>{{Cite|Thank you. For I am now allowed by this freedom... to be with you once again.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> Mipha explains that, as a spirit, her ability to heal would be wasted on her.<ref>{{Cite|Since I am now a spirit, my healing power would be wasted on me. I have no need of it.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> The Zora Champion then gives Link her healing power, known as [[Mipha's Grace]].<ref>{{Cite|So therefore... I would like you to have it. Please accept... Mipha's Grace.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> Mipha tells the hero that the day before, she had almost given up hope of being freed, accepting that she may remain trapped within Vah Ruta for eternity.<ref>{{Cite|Yesterday, I was awash in a pool of tears. I had nearly given up hope and resigned myself to being trapped here, as a spirit, for the rest of eternity.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> She then reveals that she had hoped all this time to see Link once more.<ref>{{Cite|But now you're here.

I wish I could see you again... Even just once more...|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> \n\nMipha\u2019s father, King Dorephan, gives Link Mipha's Lightscale Trident after freeing Vah Ruta as a sign of gratitude from the Zora.<ref>{{Cite|By the way, Link.

Link, all of the Zora thank you from the depths of our hearts for your heroic and selfless work!...|King Dorephan|BotW}}</ref> \n\nDuring Link's 10th [[Recovered Memory]], \"[[Mipha's Touch]]\", it is revealed that Mipha and Link were childhood friends. Mipha and Link are shown sitting on Vah Ruta's trunk, as Mipha heals a wound on Link's arm. She remarks that this reminds her of when they first met.<ref>{{Cite|I was thinking... this reminds me of the time we first met.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> She describes Link as having been a reckless boy, injuring himself at every turn, and that she would always heal him.<ref>{{Cite|You were just a reckless child... always getting yourself hurt at every turn. Every time, I would heal you. Just as I am doing right now.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> The Zora comments that since he was a [[Hylian]], Link seemed to grow up much faster than she.<ref>{{Cite|I thought it was funny how, being a Hylian, you looked grown-up so much faster than I did.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> Mipha then changes the subject, asking what could be done if Calamity Ganon truly returned, since they do not know much about the oncoming dangers.<ref>{{Cite|So if this Calamity Ganon does, in fact, return, what can we really do? We just don't seen to know much about what we'll be up against.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> Mipha assures Link that no matter how difficult the battle is, or how severe his wounds, she is willing to heal and protect him.<ref>{{Cite|But know this: that no matter how difficult this battle might get...If you-if anyone ever tries to do you harm... Then I will heal you. No matter when, or how bad the wound... I hope you know... that I will always protect you.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> Shyly, Mipha says that perhaps when it is all over, they can spend time together as in their younger days.<ref>{{Cite|Once this whole thing is over... maybe things can go back to how they used to be when we were young. You know... perhaps we could spend some time together.|Mipha|BotW}}</ref> \n\nAfter Calamity Ganon's defeat, Mipha can be seen on top of [[Hyrule Castle]] with the other Champions' spirits and [[King Rhoam]]. \n\nAn [[amiibo]] based on Mipha released on November 10 2017.

As with the rest of the {{Plural|HWAoC|Champion|link}}, she is present in the final battle against {{Term|HWAoC|Calamity Ganon}}. After their victory, {{Term|HWAoC|Mipha}} bids {{Term|HWAoC|Sidon}} farewell when he is returned to {{BotW|-}}<nowiki>'</nowiki>s timeline.\n\nAs a playable {{Term|HWAoC|Warrior|link}}, {{Term|HWAoC|Mipha}} wields a spear in combat and attacks with fast, multi-hitting combo attacks mixed with {{Term|HWAoC|Water (Terrain)|link}} magic. Her Unique Action allows her to form a geyser and warp to it while jumping in the air, giving her an aerial advantage and hitting her opponent's {{Term|HWAoC|Weak Point|link}}. She can also warp to {{Term|HWAoC|Water (Terrain)}} constructs created by her Strong Attacks. Her Enhanced Ability grants her a shockwave whenever she emerges from a geyser or construct. Her Special Attack uniquely heals herself as well as nearby allies, making her especially useful in missions where healing items are disabled or cannot drop.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\nLike most {{Plural|Series|Zora|link}} in {{BotW|-}}, {{Term|Series|Mipha}}'s name is a musical reference.
