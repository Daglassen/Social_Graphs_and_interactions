Narah is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Narah is a friendly, fun-loving little girl who lives in Hateno Village and spends her time running around in front of Ton Pu Inn. She very much enjoys running, but also enjoys conversation and will demand that Link ask her some questions. Link can ask her three different things: who Narah cares about, what she enjoys doing, and what things she likes. Whenever she answers one of Link's questions, she will ask to keep the conversation going.
Asking who she cares about leads Narah to declare her love for her mother Nikki, but she admits that the woman is always busy talking to her friend Amira. She mentions that if she wants to talk to her mother, she will sneak up on the pair of adults.
If Link asks her what she likes to do, Narah tells him how she enjoys catching bugs. She will even teach the adventurer her technique for doing so.
Link can ask the girl what sorts of things she likes and Narah will respond with an enthusiastic list of Gems, Rupees, and love. If Link has a Sapphire in his possession, she will pause and think before recommending that he sell it.
Once the conversation is done, the child will cheerfully bid him goodbye.
When it rains, Narah will hurry home to stay dry.
