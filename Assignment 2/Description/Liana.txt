This is the barracks for Gerudo soldiers!|Liana|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|We're on high alert right now. If you want to do some sightseeing, go check out the market instead!|Liana|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks what happened, Liana begins to explain but quickly realizes that she should not tell an outsider anything involving their security.<ref>{{Cite|Well, you see... Wait, why would I tell an outsider like you about important matters involving the security of our people?!|Liana|BotW}}</ref> She mentions that she could tell him if he had permission from [[Captain Teake]].<ref>{{Cite|If you had permission from {{Color|BotW Blue|Captain Teake}}, that'd be a different story...|Liana|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Liana or [[Leena]] after speaking to [[Riju]] for the first time, Liana asks where [[Barta]] is.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, I haven't seen Barta.

I wonder what happened to her...|Leena|BotW}}</ref> Angered, Liana asks why she let Barta go by herself and Leena apologizes.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|You\u2014 Are you serious?!}} Why did you let her go by herself?! And why did you wait two days to report this?!|Liana|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I'm\u2014 I apologize... She said she just wanted to check it out and would be careful, so I thought...|Leena|BotW}}</ref> Liana is upset that they now have to retrieve both the [[Thunder Helm]] and Barta.<ref>{{Cite|Uuugghhh. As if we aren't busy enough searching for the chief's heirloom, now we have to find {{Color|BotW Blue|Barta}} too...|Liana|BotW}}</ref> She expresses concern about Captain Teake finding out about it and [[Kotta]] asks what they should do,<ref>{{Cite|If the captain hears about this fiasco, she'll punish us for sure! Probably 100 laps around Gerudo Desert...again.|Liana|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Oh... Oh, no. What should we do?|Kotta|BotW}}</ref> causing Liana to yell that she is thinking about it.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|I'm thinking about it!}}|Liana|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link talks to Liana after calming the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Naboris|link}}, she admits that she dismissed Link's abilities too quickly.<ref>{{Cite|Sav'otta!
