He carries a {{Term|BotW|Cobble Crusher|link}}, and he noticeably speaks with a slur where his vowels extend.<ref>{{Cite|They call meeeee...{{Color|BotW Blue|Draaaaak}}!|Drak|BotW}}</ref> Drak helps Link with explaining the area to him. He tells him that the Abandoned North Mine used to be active,<ref>{{Cite|This is the {{Color|BotW Blue|Abandoned North Mine}}. Oh, and this is the little ditty we all used to siiiiing as we worked: {{Color|BotW Red|Ammo}} goes BOOM 'til {{Color|BotW Blue|ore}} fills the ROOM! Gather said {{Color|BotW Blue|ORE}} for rupees GALORE! Dig all the DAY to get the good PAY!|Drak|BotW}}</ref> until it grew too hot and dangerous due to the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}} and the infestation of monsters.<ref>{{Cite|Yeah, this is a famous mine, my maaaan. Or it was...until {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast Vah Rudania}} showed up. Now it's waaaay too hot! There's tons more lava and all kiiiiiinds of monsters out and about. It's so dangerous, we can't dig here anymore!|Drak|BotW}}</ref> Because of that, {{Term|BotW|Bludo|link}} had appointed him to keep watch of the area.<ref>{{Cite|This place is daaangerous, so Boss told me not to let anyone through... That means you tooooo, my maaaan.|Drak|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} first speaks to Drak, he wonders why so many people are out and about.<ref>{{Cite|Yeesh! What's goin' on today?! So many peeeople out and about!|Drak|BotW}}</ref> He warns Link that the {{Term|BotW|Scorching Climate|link}} gets hotter past him and there are more monsters.<ref>{{Cite|You should know it gets much hotter past here, and there are also looots of monsters. It's reeeally dangerous!|Drak|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the \"{{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania (Quest)|link}}\" {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}}, he can ask about {{Term|BotW|Yunobo|link}}. Drak is at first suspicious and asks why a stranger is asking about Yunobo.<ref>{{Cite|[Do you know Yunobo?] Why's a stranger like yoooou askin' about Yunobo?|Drak|BotW}}</ref> When Link explains that Bludo asked, Drak tells {{Term|BotW|Link}} that {{Term|BotW|Yunobo}} went into the Mine's Vault to retrieve painkillers, but never returned.<ref>{{Cite|[Boss wants to know.] {{Big|Huuuuh? {{Color|BotW Blue|Boss}} does?!}} Well... Then I guess I better tell you wheeeeere Yunobo is! Yunobo...went to the {{Color|BotW Blue|vault}} to fetch some painkillers. But now that ya mention it, I suppooooose he never came back.|Drak|BotW}}</ref> Due to its danger, Drak suggests Link doesn't go after him.<ref>{{Cite|This place is daaaaangerous, so ya probably shouldn't go lookin' for him.|Drak|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link approaches the {{Term|BotW|Cannon|link}} closest to them, Drak warns him that he should not touch it.<ref>{{Cite|HEY! Stooop that! That's {{Color|BotW Red|Boss's cannon}}! Don't you daaaare touch that lever!|Drak|BotW}}</ref> He discourages Link from putting any explosives inside.<ref>{{Cite|HEEEY! YOOOOU!! Don't mess with {{Color|BotW Red|Boss's cannon}}! You dooon't wanna send a cannonball flyyyin', so don't even thiiiiink about puttin' any explosives inside!|Drak|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring \"Divine Beast Vah Rudaniah\", Drak will tell Link where Yunobo is. Once Link has rescued him from the Abandoned North Mine, Drak tells Link that Yunobo went back to Goron City.<ref>{{Cite|Yunobo? He went rushin' off to Goron City... I think. Preeeetty sure. All cuz of {{Color|BotW Blue|Rudania}}... Maaaaybe he went to talk with {{Color|BotW Blue|Boss}}?|Drak|BotW}}</ref> He also informs Link that he saw Yunobo go to the {{Term|BotW|Bridge of Eldin|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Yunobo went to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Bridge of Eldin}}...
