Unleash the Villains event Disney Hollywood Studios Wiggins also voiced Stiers Ratcliffe manservant sharp contrast his villainous master Wiggins light hearted timid and very playful scene seen cutting topiary from Virginian shrubs Although typically not considered evil character nonetheless appears very loyal his master and Ratcliffe though constantly annoyed his shenanigans seems trust him implicitly the first film end expresses regret seeing Ratcliffe for the greedy monster truly and even sobs does not appear Pocahontas Journey New World Percy was originally Ratcliffe pet pug appears spoiled and seems have irritable personality especially the first film Percy and Meeko spend most the first film fighting usually over food with Meeko always coming out top only apparently become

had change heart and does not want back Ratcliffe point cowering underneath carriage Ratcliffe presence Unlike most the other Disney animated villains Ratcliffe villains based Wikipedia John Ratcliffe governor actual historical person with the other being Prince John from Robin Hood film Robin Hood Although Ratcliffe was overall based John Ratcliffe his overall design bore closer resemblance There foreshadowing Ratcliffe character when boards the ship England Ratcliffe goes the gangplank rat seen walking rope the ship the foreground moves similar manner Ratcliffe thereby pronouncing the rat Ratcliffe Despite being the main antagonist the first film Ratcliffe does not interact with Pocahontas until their first true onscreen meeting the second film Another Disney villain Facilier from The Princess and the Frog The Princess and the Frog would follow suit his interactions are mostly with Prince Naveen rather than main character Tiana though the latter does know Facilier reputation and comes face face with him during the climax the final scenes both films Ratcliffe wearing his armor The Governor Ratcliffe action figure doesn come with the hat cape real life the supervisor John Smith ship the journey America was Christopher Newport not Ratcliffe The real life version Governor John Ratcliffe was far more positive figure never tried exterminate the Natives but actually tried negotiate with them and war erupted because the hostility Chief Powhatan Ratcliffe portrayal the second movie highly inconsistent with the first movie which claims have never been popular among the Royal Court who consider him pathetic social climber who fails every assignment His mission colonize the Americas was his own words his last chance prove himself and failed And yet the second movie highly respected figure the British Court even going far able manipulate the King himself acting his closest adviser David Ogden Stiers who voices Ratcliffe also voiced his servant Wiggins Pocahontas Journey New World Stiers also voiced the Drunk Man the Hunt Ball who invites Pocahontas and John Rolfe party his house but was uncredited for that role Ratcliffe never called his first name John possible that this was done avoid confusing audiences especially children with him and John Smith Villains"
