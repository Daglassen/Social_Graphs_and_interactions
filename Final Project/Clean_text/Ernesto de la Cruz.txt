before ultimately throwing Miguel from the building much the horror the Riveras and the whole audience Satisfied and believing has won Ernesto casually passes the horrified Riveras and weakened u00e9ctor giving cruelly sarcastic apology his former friend Straightening Ernesto gleefully returns the stage only met with boos jeers and scowls from the audience who furiously labels him murderer and orders him get off the stage Shrugging this off Ernesto tries start the orchestra but the instrumentalists only glare him with outrage and contempt the stoic conductor responds his attempts snapping his baton without word second thought Ernesto then tries win the crowd over singing Remember song Remember but the livid crowd just boos even more they throw food him Confused this reception Ernesto sees the monitors that Pepita has just saved Miguel and realizes that his vile actions have been revealed all the Land the Dead well causing him silently devastated the fact that his legacy has now been destroyed and had lost everything ponders what Ernesto looks behind him see Pepita emerge from the curtains ready punish the murderous musician for everything put the family through when murdered u00e9ctor she menacingly approaches him Ernesto can only meekly beg Pepita not hurt him but the alebrije responds with roar and pushes him offstage before catching him the pelvis area and carrying him out the stadium Screaming and begging frantic terror the crowd watches with curious glee Ernesto then thrown toward nearby bell tower where smacks face first into the iron bell with resounding clang before falling underneath While recovering the bell breaks loose and falls horrified Ernesto who barely able crawl away once again stopping him and trapping him inside the bell for good This all broadcasted the camera staff everyone the arena who cheer his defeat except for individual returning from the concession stand and asking his wife what missed Returning the Land the Living Miguel reveals his family what had happened u00e9ctor all those years ago and Cruz vile actions Using the letters u00e9ctor sent Mam u00e1 Coco when she was young the living Riveras expose Ernesto murderous crimes and manage save u00e9ctor from being forgotten One year the next Dia Los Muertos u00e9ctor now credited Santa Cecilia authentic musician and songwriter while Ernesto bust his mausoleum now has sign reading FORGET YOU hung and the mausoleum has fallen into permanent disrepair well With that Ernesto Cruz now known nothing more than infamous fraud thief and murderer both the lands the living and dead Ernesto designed after famous Mexican actors and singers from the Golden Age Mexican Cinema particular Jorge Negrete his party Ernesto seen interacting with Negrete and Pedro Infante his inspirations The message the sign FORGET YOU hung Ernesto bust the film ending was altered versions Some have translated version the message while other international versions especially the English version with Spanish subtitles released Mexico and some American cinemas have replaced the message with big instead Ernesto the Spanish variation the name Ernest which sounds and spelled very similarly the word earnest meaning truthful genuine heartfelt And his last name Spanish for the cross meaning his name literally Heartfelt the Cross This major cause dramatic irony considering his true nature liar fraud and murderer With the exception Remember which was sung his original voice actor Ernesto singing voice provided different actor Antonio Sol Several easy miss signs that foreshadow Ernesto true colors and hint that not the father Coco the Rivera family portrait although Imelda husband wore outfit similar Ernesto the belt buckle had guitars Ernesto belt buckle does not have this emblem but rather the symbol bull head The faceless man the photo also has noticeably thinner body type When Miguel shows Coco her family photo and asks her Ernesto was her father Coco says Papa while pointing him their photo but she never said that was Ernesto Early when Miguel watches old video Ernesto the camera zooms the latter hands when playing notes implying stunt double There are only wide shots Ernesto when merely strumming hinting not talented appears Frida Kahlo says that Ernesto does not show rehearsals preferring instead host parties his mansion which again demonstrates how prioritizes attention over music and fans The same goes for u00e9ctor who complains about that fact When both speak this they speak rather negative tone reinforcing the fact that Ernesto wasn talented the first place When Miguel runs away from u00e9ctor and Imelda Dante tugs him stop him from going Ernesto mansion Furthermore during the argument between Imelda and Miguel when the latter runs away from the former his pursuit find Ernesto get his blessing Imelda does not mention Ernesto even though she did mention her husband stating that wanted play for the world When Miguel first calls Ernesto his great great grandfather Ernesto clearly shocked but still believed him This implies that while Ernesto never married had any children had least extramarital love affair and given the time period and culture which lived was worried about his reputation getting ruined the accidental conception child outside wedlock This was shown earlier when Miguel claims himself Ernesto descendant aka great great grandson u00e9ctor noticeably surprised and confused While this could interpreted u00e9ctor being shocked such bold claims could also seen u00e9ctor knowing what kind person Ernesto womanizer and his shocked disbelief could viewed him thinking Ernesto had bastard child u00e9ctor states that Ernesto wasn very talented This proven true when the latter states the flashback that can succeed without u00e9ctor songs The novelization gives hint the flashback chapters Ernesto convinces u00e9ctor series tours throughout Mexico During their performances u00e9ctor notices that Ernesto u2019s singing and playing style shifts between happy and half hearted depending the audience size and realizes that his partner cares more about attention than about the art behind music When Miguel asks Ernesto how felt about leaving his family the latter gives vague response that was hard but had follow his dreams Ernesto does not mention wife daughter let alone Imelda Coco and possibly was talking about his parents Also does not show signs feeling remorseful foreshadowing his lack contrition Ernesto casually speaks when saying that needs get Miguel home rather than with concern prepares give the blessing Ernesto also states hopes for Miguel die very soon The first action foreshadows Ernesto lack authentic compassion while the second action foreshadows the lengths which willing avoid being exposed upstaged When Ernesto offers Miguel his blessing the Aztec Marigold petal did not glow like when Imelda did the same thing earlier the film when the petal did glow indicating that they are not relatives However the https pixarcocomovie tumblr com post 168549398747 all lee unkrichs twitter responses from involved movie staff have stated that person can give their blessing anyone who loved like family member not just blood relative but said feeling must mutual This implies while Miguel views Ernesto family Ernesto views Miguel merely disposable vehicle fame Miguel family does not object Miguel mentioning Ernesto even though they object him referencing Coco father although they did mention that they never knew about Coco father identity Furthermore when Miguel declares Ernesto his great great grandfather the family claims that impossible Whenever Miguel family talks about Coco father mentioned that was forgotten and left off the ofrenda Ernesto the other hand remembered many people both living and dead This the most obvious hint that Ernesto not Miguel great great grandfather point when Miguel brings his asymmetrical dimples Ernesto followed saying dimple Upon rewatching obvious sign that Ernesto subtly insulting Miguel wasn anyone special since lacking dimples common trait When Miguel takes Ernesto advice seizing your moment Miguel had done many shady things while getting himself trouble This hints Ernesto was never good man the first place Upon listening Ernesto u2019s version u201cRemember u201d more than once might notice the emotional lyrics sound out place with the catchy instrumental This shows how Ernesto complete sellout and only cared about popularity while Hector cared about songwriting Despite getting crushed second time Ernesto still exists the Land the Dead Lee Unkrich confirmed Unkrich has stated that Ernesto still remembered for his movies and his story the who stole u00e9ctor guitar and his songs and murdered him albeit permanently disgraced Thus unique among Disney Pixar villains that died before the events the film rather than the end not all and thus dead though very much active during his antagonistic role Ernesto the first and currently only main antagonist Pixar movie already dead This also fits with the general Disney tradition giving villains fitting fate all that mattered Ernesto was fame and the adoration that came with now stuck permanent existence unable cross over the Land the Living and denied the Final Death people insist remembering his vile actions murders famous people are remembered This was originally explored the deleted scene the Bridge where Ernesto was hot pursuit Miguel the decaying Marigold Bridge where they would have showdown during sunrise once Dia los Muertos ended after the countdown Ernesto ended getting evaporated with the marigold petals grabbed Miguel This was scrapped proved too much rehash the climaxes the Disney Renaissance films Taking into account the years which they were born Ernesto four years older than u00e9ctor was around years old when died outliving u00e9ctor years u2015the same span time u00e9ctor was alive Ernesto downfall shared with fellow Pixar villain Henry Waternoose from Monsters Inc both had their true motives caught camera and lost their respect from the public However Waternoose had more firm and understandable reasons for his actions ultimately going mad save his company and stop the energy crisis while Ernesto murdered u00e9ctor for selfish reasons such fame and recognition Ernesto also has similarities with another Pixar main antagonist Charles Muntz from both are celebrities who are initially idolized the protagonists When the protagonists learn their true nature they stop idolizing them and become their enemies Furthermore they try kill their former fans stop them from ruining their plans seemed have familiarity with Imelda possibly having come contact with her before and u00e9ctor left Santa Cecilia which made sense she was his former best friend wife When u00e9ctor was about leave Ernesto Ernesto immediately offered drink that had poison that kills u00e9ctor However there was preparation for Ernesto poisoning the alcohol shown This indicates that the alcohol had already been poisoned prior can explained that Ernesto may have gotten the poison while the tour And since and u00e9ctor had been touring for some time there are indications that they argued over constantly with Ernesto managing talk him out while making contingency plans including having the poison hand kill him insisted leaving when u00e9ctor finally decided home and ignored Ernesto pleas that was when Ernesto snapped and poisoned him the deleted scene Family Fix Ernesto snatches u00e9ctor guitar from Miguel then known Marco during development and breaks which ended destroying his only hope getting home right front the audience and the Riveras the main stage this point reviled the dead and given final slipper the head Imelda was scrapped because went against how Ernesto downfall was finalized the deleted scene Dia los muertos features group people singing calm ballad before turning over the top and practically bastardizes the meaning the holiday This could mean foreshadow how Ernesto bastardizes u00e9ctor song Remember from personal family song into flashy fame song Ernesto serves dark parallel Miguel both them are determined become musicians However while Miguel desire become musician comes from his passion and love for music Ernesto only wanted musician gain fame glory and attention for himself Miguel hadn learned how family important him would have ended like Ernesto who didn care about family and friendship Ernesto downfall was possible primarily because his movies Ernesto had not included the poisoning scene that parallels his poisoning u00e9ctor his true nature may have never come light Ernesto alebrijes are Chihuahua which are reflection his arrogance like the tiny Mexican dog acts high and mighty when really anything but Coco characters"
