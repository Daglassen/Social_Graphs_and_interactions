She's angry that Genli and the rest of her sisters have not arrived for their rehearsal.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Grrrrrr! My sisters are dumb DUMMIES!}} They promised we'd rehearse together, but NO ONE showed up!|Kheel|BotW}}</ref> They're supposed to perform for {{Term|BotW|Kaneli|link}}, the elder of Rito Village, but Kheel thinks they'll be laughed off the stage.<ref>{{Cite|We have to perform our song for the {{Color|BotW Blue|elder}} at {{Color|BotW Red|Warbler's Nest}}!

You look like I can use you... Thaaaat is to say...you look like a nice guy who likes to help people in need. Can you go tell my sisters in Rito Village to stop ditching rehearsal?

She's probably in the {{Color|BotW Red|kitchen}} yelling, {{Big|\"I want some {{Color|BotW Blue|salmon meuni\u00e8re}}!\"}} ...or something like that.|Kheel|BotW}}</ref> This begins the \"{{Term|BotW|Recital at Warbler's Nest|link}}\" {{Term|BotW|Shrine Quest|link}}.\n\nBack in Rito Village, Genli is indeed in the kitchen begging for Salmon Meuni\u00e8re.<ref>{{Cite|Hurry!

Who knew Warbler's Nest was keeping a secret like that|Genli|BotW}}</ref> The sisters decide to leave to inform their mother,<ref>{{Cite|Let's tell mom!|Notts|BotW}}</ref> and the five of them race back to Rito Village.\n\nAfterwards, Genli practices singing with her sisters near {{Term|BotW|Akh Va'quot Shrine|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|On my way to go practice at the village shrine!|Genli|BotW}}</ref> She shows off her singing to Link,<ref>{{Cite|Hey, check it out.
