She has recently moved to {{Term|BotW|Hateno Village|link}} from her hometown, {{Term|BotW|Lurelin Village|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|I was reminiscing about my hometown of Lurelin Village by the sea. The view and the air are different here in Hateno Village, but this is where my wonderful husband calls home.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref> Ralera is a newly wed who adores her husband and is more than willing to aid him in his work.<ref>{{Cite|I count myself lucky to be able to live and work alongside such a wonderful, loving man.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref> While she enjoys the air of Hateno, she does mention that it is unlike the breeze she grew up with.<ref>{{Cite|What a nice breeze... It doesn\u2019t carry that tang of salt on it, though.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref>\n\nRalera is a carefree woman who enjoys chatting with passersby and will happily talk about things with {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}. He can ask her about Lurelin Village and she will describe it for him as a fishing community past the {{Term|BotW|Bridge of Hylia|link}}, which she herself had to cross with her husband.<ref>{{Cite|[Lurelin Village?] It\u2019s a small fishing community far to the south. I lived there before I moved here with my new husband. We had to cross the {{Color|BotW Blue|Bridge of Hylia}} to get here, weighted down with everything I couldn\u2019t bear to leave behind. Thinking back on it, it\u2019s a wonder either of us survived the trip...\n|Ralera|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Lurelin Village is a small fishing town on the south side of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Bridge of Hylia}}.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref> She takes a moment to reflect on how her father is doing, as she has not returned to the village after being married.<ref>{{Cite| I haven\u2019t been back there yet since I moved here after the wedding. I wonder if Father is still healthy enough to go raft fishing...|Ralera|BotW}}</ref>\n\nShould Link ask what she is doing, Ralera explains how she watches the windmills for Rhodes's work during the day.<ref>{{Cite|[What are you doing?] I take care of the windmills during the day in place of my husband. The windmills have to turn at the right speed, or we can\u2019t grind the four!|Ralera|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|[What are you doing?] The windmills have to keep turning, so my husband and I watch them in shifts.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref> She enjoys doing so, as she finds sitting there peaceful, and so is quite relaxed about the work.<ref>{{Cite|My husband is very particular when it comes to our work. But I take a more freewheeling attitude toward it.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It\u2019s a pleasant job. Sitting here and watching the world go by makes it feel like a very peaceful place.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It\u2019ll be time for work soon. I have a lovely job that lets me sit here, watch the windmills, and feel the breeze in my hair.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref>\n\nSitting beside her is a {{Term|BotW|Blue Flame Pedestal|link}}, which Link can point out. Ralera can tell him that the {{Term|BotW|Purah|link|display = Hateno Ancient Tech Lab director}} lights these lanterns with a {{Term|BotW|Blue Flame|link}}, but admits that she does not know much more than that.<ref>{{Cite| [What is this thing?] Oh, you\u2019ve noticed these, have you? It\u2019s apparently one of the {{Color|BotW Blue|lanterns}} that the {{Color|BotW Blue|Hateno Ancient Tech Lab}}\u2019s {{Color|BotW Blue|director}} lights with the {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}}... |Ralera|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|[What is this thing?] They say this {{Color|BotW Blue|lantern}} needs {{Color|BotW Blue|blue flame}} from the {{Color|BotW Blue|director}} at the {{Color|BotW Blue|Hateno Ancient Tech Lab}}. Oh, but I\u2019m not guarding it. I\u2019m just sitting here watching the windmill. I was married recently and moved here to my husband\u2019s hometown, so I can\u2019t tell you much more than that.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref> However, she does wonder if the {{Term|BotW|Hateno Ancient Tech Lab|link}} still has a director at all, as she has not seen them.<ref>{{Cite|But if there\u2019s still a {{Color|BotW Blue|director}} there, I\u2019ve never seen her. Not even once since moving here after my marriage.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref> She encourages Link to visit the lab himself.<ref>{{Cite|If you\u2019re curious, why not head up the road and pay a visit to the {{Color|BotW Blue|director}}?|Ralera|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt 9 o'clock in the evening, her shift at the windmills is over and she heads for home to get some sleep.<ref>{{Cite|I\u2019m sorry, but I should go get ready for bed now.|Ralera|BotW}}</ref> While she rests, she sleep-talks about how Rhodes is currently watching over the windmills in her place.<ref>{{Cite|It's so late... Husband's turn now... Zzz...|Ralera|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAccording to her husband, Ralera was the one to suggest they go in shifts.<ref>{{Cite|My love for her is so powerful that she suggested we take shifts.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hateno Villagers, Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
