During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Angler plays the game with the other crew members just as [[Will Turner]] offers to challenge against [[Davy Jones]]. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.\n\nThe next day, Angler and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Angler and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]]. During an ambush between the ''Dutchman'' and the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', Angler fires his cannons on Jack Sparrow's ship. The ''Pearl'' escapes while the Kraken tears the ship apart.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===\nAngler returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Angler and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''.\n\nDuring battle at the maelstrom, Angler and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men while Jack Sparrow fights against Davy Jones. During battle, Angler attempted to attack the ''Black Pearl'' trying to reach via rope, but was struck [[Marty (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Marty]] using a cannon. He later fights against one of Tai Huang's men and when Jack arrives, he swung between the two.\n\nAfter the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, it is possible that Angler and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman'' just as both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.\n\n==Video game appearances==\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|''At World's End'']]===\nAngler serves as a minor mini-boss in the video game adaptation of the film. To defeat him, the player must defeat smaller enemies and then perform a special move to defeat him.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Angler Angler] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]"
