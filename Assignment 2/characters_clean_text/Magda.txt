Magda is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Magda is a Hylian woman who resides on the Floret Sandbar. Magda planted a maze of flowers surrounding the Hila Rao Shrine, where she regularly tends to them. Because of her investment in her garden, she becomes upset if people step on or harm the flowers. If Link speaks to Magda or disrupts the flowers, she will either tell him about her flower patch or reprimand him, initiating the "Watch Out for the Flowers" Shrine Quest. If Link disrupts the flowers a second time, she will yell at him and tell him to treat the flowers carefully. If he does so a third time, Magda will break down and frantically run around her flower patch. While running through her garden, she will rant at Link about his trespasses before falling on her face. She then resolves to make Link understand the "flowers' rage" before attacking him.
When Magda attacks Link, she will remove three Hearts from his Life Gauge. If Link has less than three Hearts when she attacks, she will not cause any damage to him, instead knocking him out. Link can repeat this process indefinitely.
