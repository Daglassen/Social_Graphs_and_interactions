" Huntsman also known as Huntsmaster is the leader of The Huntsclan and the main antagonist of the Disney Channel animated series American Dragon Jake Long The Huntsman sometimes referred to as Huntsmaster by his subordinates was the leader of the The Huntsclan Huntsclan as well as Jake Long s main archenemy rated by the The Dragon Council Dragon Council as the fourth greatest threat to the magical community He was an extremely bitter man with an absolute deep hatred toward all magical creatures especially Dragons Jake Long Universe dragons believing them to be freaks of nature Extraordinarily ruthless the Huntsman was obsessed with killing magical creatures and had no problems with killing any normal humans he would consider as traitors who got in the Huntsclan s way or even allies with magical creatures even going so far as to disposing of his own subordinates if they failed or betrayed the Huntsclan Once he threatened a student with death in a stern warning never to betray the Huntsclan and is also shown forcing failing students to fight an imposing monster known as the Krakken Atlantis Milo s Return Krakken The Academy The Huntsman s personality is normally menacing callous level headed and horrifically murderous and he is seldom shown losing his temper or displaying strong emotions other than hatred The Huntsman has an intimidating stature His fighting skills are superb he has impressive agility and acrobatic ability as well as nearly superhuman strength and durability even able to punch through a brick wall another time was barely phased by being slammed headfirst through a metal elevator door and even yanked the elevator pulley out with his bare hands in a fit of rage Nonetheless he left most of the physical work to his apprentice Huntsgirl and limited his role in a fight to firing energy blasts with his staff weapon Ironically despite the Huntsman s generally serious behavior and performance he was often defeated in comical fashion such as being defeated by Jake s flaming flatulence Another time Jake went back in time and embarrassed the Huntsman in front of his peers While the leader of the Huntsclan it was discovered other members of the Huntsclan held Huntsmaster ranks similar to his own One time Jake Long Jake traveled to the past of 1986 where he met a teenage Huntsman As a teenager the Huntsman was a Huntsclan apprentice with a scrawny physique and a high pitched voice that earned him the derision of his Huntsclan peers Because of Jake s time travel the Huntsman s first assignment was kidnapping Jonathan Long so the Huntsclan could force him to reveal the identity of a dragon known to be at their school unknown to them to be Susan Long due to rumors he was dating one The Huntsman attempted to slay Jake several times Jake finally accidentally dropped him into a monster pit where he was mauled by a vicious large beast He barely got out When the Huntsman emerged from the pit the experience resulted him in being deformed and his voice had changed to his present deep voice which made his peers fear him This also resulted in his hatred for magical creatures in general and dragons specifically and he vowed to one day slay all dragons on the face of the Earth Whatever his first assignment was in the original timeline remains unknown Much of the Huntsman s plans were eventually revealed as attempting to gather thirteen mystical The 13 Aztec Skulls Aztec Crystal Skulls which had the power to destroy all magical beings if brought together with a ritual In addition he began to grow distrustful of his apprentice Tension and mistrust developed between the Huntsman and his apprentice Rose due to her having fallen in love with Jake and acting as a double agent against the Huntsclan Early on Rose referred to the Huntsman as her uncle as she believed at the time they were related However she later learned differently during an adventure in the dream realm the Huntsman stole Rose from Rose s parents her parents immediately after she was born after learning of her birthmark raising her as his apprentice while leading her to believe her parents were dead Eventually the Huntsman found out about Rose s change of allegiances and revealed he knew the whereabouts of her parents threatening to kill them if she did not bring him the three Aztec skulls held by Jake Long Later the Huntsman managed to gather all thirteen Aztec skulls after a major battle in which Jake and his allies are defeated by the Huntsclan The Huntsman started the ritual to use the skulls to wish for the destruction of all magical creatures but Rose knocked him aside with a shot from her staff weapon She then used the skulls to instead wish for the destruction of all Huntsclan where they started to vanish into thin air However all which was left of the 4 threat to the magical world was his cape and scattered Huntsclan bases around the world At first the Huntsman s face was never shown beyond glowing red eyes underneath a black hood it was later changed in the second season Eventually after once again involved with their Academy activities he wore a ninja face mask his eyes clearly visible while dressed in a more military like outfit His helmet has a slightly wolf like appearance Something terrible happened to him at some point in his past Seen from the behind the back of his head is shown as bald and slightly deformed briefly revealed back of his head was mottled with burns with veins standing out as a mechanical arm lowered his helmet onto his head The Huntsman s face is finally seen without his masks after his helmet was destroyed when Jake slammed him through an elevator door He was shown as a bald but otherwise normal looking human with a large full body dragon birthmark partially covering the left side of his face It is unclear if this is a second mark from the one the palm of one of his hands or a continuation of the same marking Since the American Dragon in dragon form is obviously a fledgling the Huntsman stood taller than he whenever they fought Another possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy between his true appearance and what was revealed of the back of his head may be attributed to Jake s time travel stint altering something in the past The Huntsman was a highly skilled hunter strong enough to take down a full grown dragon with a little help being able to hold his own against Jake and the strongest Magical Creatures He was skilled in almost every single weapon especially of Huntsclan technology The Huntsmen s appearance was likely changed due to the exaggeration of it his red eyes for example As his character is intended to be a hateful human being The scene where the Huntsman s burnt head is covered with a helmet lowered by a mechanical arm is an homage to a similar scene in http starwars wikia com wiki Star_Wars_Episode_V _The_Empire_Strikes_Back The Empire Strikes Back where the back of http starwars wikia com wiki
