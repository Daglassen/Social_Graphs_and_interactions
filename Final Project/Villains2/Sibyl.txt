She is the Head Chronicom, and their Predictor, with the ability to foretell possible outcomes, based on probability. She works with the Chronicom Hunters, to prevent the formation of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and establish a new homeland on Earth. She is portrayed by Tamara, and makes her first appearance in the season seven episode, \"[[Alien Commies from the Future!]]\".\n\nSibyl was created by Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen.\n\n==Background==\nWhile Sybil takes on the form, and is referred to as a female, she, like all Chronicoms, has no gender.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n*'''Prediction''': Sibyl has the ability to foresee the outcome of future events, and how the Hunters actions, may create different effects in the timeline, with the Time Stream.\n*'''Projection''': The ability to project images, into a 3D space. Sibyl displayed this when showing the Luke and Abel, a projection of Helius.\n\n==History==\nFollowing the destruction of Chronyca-2 by [[Izel]] and her Shrike, the Chronicoms begin to pursue Chronyca-3 on Earth, by travelling back in time, and preventing the formation of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Sybil predicts, that should they choose to pursue this mission, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] may also follow them back in time. Should the Chronicom Hunters be compromised, she has them set to self destruction. She has her digital mind, placed into a virtual space.\n\nHaving now travelled to the year [[1955]], the Chronicom Hunters, Luke and Abel report to Sibyl, revealing their adversaries are following their time trails, just as she had stated. Luke says that despite, this, they have yet to discover the Chronicoms ships, which is at their advantage. Abel however, disagrees, and when Sibyl asks for clarification, he argues they could have eliminated all the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, when Cain was captured, had they been set to detonate, when compromised, instead of self destruction. When questioning why they aren't, Sibyl states that the advanced technology they're made up of, would be scattered across the past, which would only hasten the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D.. When Abel asks what the others think, Luke reveals their are no other Predictors, while she states they must be delicate, while dealing with time-travel. The Chronicoms plan to use Helius, a classified project being worked on, in the year they've traveled to, in order to stop the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. When asked if it's still a viable option, Sibyl affirms, if their mission is completed correctly, then according to her prediction, it will be brutal, and exacting.\n\nWhen S.H.I.E.L.D. are able to stop Helius, Sibyl predicts that they will find [[Freddy Malick|Wilfred Malick]], in [[1976]], and has the Chronicoms make the necessary preparations, to stop them.\n\nWhile using her ability of foresight, Sibyl makes remarks about the prospers of life. Luke dismisses her statements, discontent with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents for killing Wilfred Malick, and stopping Project INSIGHT. When he asks if Sybil envisioned this, Sibyl replies in a metaphor, remarking that when one branch dies, a new one will bear fruit. She reveals that because S.H.I.E.L.D. stopped INSIGHT, they revealed their location, Malick's son has captured [[Quake|Daisy Johnson]], and they can use [[Alphonso Mackenzie]]'s parents, to force him into the lighthouse, noting their recklessness. When Luke asks if she wishes to proceed with the next phase, Sibyl agrees, and has Luke awaken new Chronicom Hunters.\n\nLater on, Sybil is visited by [[Phil Coulson (LMD)|Phil Coulson]]. He questions his whereabouts, and Sybil answers, that his mind is in a virtual space, while his physical form is surrounded by Chronicoms Hunters, in their ship, placed underground. She introduces herself and divulges the extent of her powers of prediction, by reading the time ttream. When Coulson comments that she is unlike any Chronicom, he has ever met, Sybil returns the sentiment. Coulson dismisses her claims, and Sybil clarifies he isn't a person, and questions his existence. When Coulson finds that she'll answer everything he asks, Sybil states she sees no reason not to. Coulsons asks for the whereabouts of Daisy, and Sibyl discloses that she was abducted by Nathaniel Malick, who wants to take her power. She estimates his chance of success, at 22%, and Daisy's survival, at 86%. Coulson then proceeds to ask, what they want with Mack's parents, to which she replies, Mack. Coulson questions whether this a plot yo get to them, so they can obtain Earth, but Sibyl states, he already knows the answer. When asking why she wants Earth, she responds that she wants to ensure the survival of her species. Coulson sarcastically states how much they have in common, ans how they should speak more often, though Sibyl points out that neither one of them are actually speaking. Coulson then proceeds to ask his final question; why the Chronicoms's survival is more important than the humans. Sibyl asks for clarity, and Coulson rephrases his question, asking what the difference between a Chronicom and a human is. Sibyl states, that time is the main factor, and how humans act irrationally, to prevent themselves or others from experiencing death, unlike Chronicoms, who cannot die. She then calls on him to ask himself, what category he himself, falls into. Because the Chronicoms will live long after the humans die, should they obtain a planet, Sibyl believes that the humans will give up, or run out of time, reiterating its importance. Coulson disregards Sybil's views and declares three things she was wrong about: sacrifice, which is all the more meaningful, because their time is limited, how they will never give up, and her views on Coulson. He affirms, he is no longer afraid of death, which he cites, as his \"superpower\", before leaving the virtual space. He then proceeds to explode the spaceship, where Sibyl's virtual space is located in, effectively disintegrating her physical form.\n\nSybil manages to escape complete annihilation, by transferring her consciousness, into the power supply of River's End. She eventually ends up into a computer, which is brought to electronic repairman, Russell Feldman. While he runs diagnostics, in an attempt to fix it, Sibyl communicates with him, via a message on the screen, asking if he would like to help her. He agrees to do so, and she prints an image of face, and introduces herself. Over the course of twenty months, Sibyl builds a rapport with Russel, and he manages to build her a device, which allows her to project her voice. She also provides him with blueprints, for a physical body, but technology required, is too advanced for the era, though Feldman vows to helps restore her. He manages to create a robotic body for Sybil, and comes home one day, to provides her with flowers, in an effort to court her. Later on, Sibyl tasks him with retrieving weaponry for her, while she secretly builds a robotic army. When he returns home, he questions Sybil's motives, and if he is enough for her. She merely states he has served his purpose, and has one of her creations, kill him, by drilling into his stomach. Sybil then tasks her robotic inventions, to invade the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, so she can collect the time stream, which will allow her to reclaim her powers of prediction, and has them kill on sight. She runs into The Deke Squad, and informs them, she has made the necessary preparations for the encounter, unlike last time, when Coulson took her by surprise. As Olga heads towards her with a knife, Sybil shoots a laser beam in her direction, hurdling her back in the wall, and causing The Deke Squad to run away. As she heads towards them, [[Deke Shaw|Deke]] stands in front of her, and demands her surrender, and as she attacks him, Mack and Roxy Glass ambush her from behind, by throwing an explosion, in her direction and triggering it, destroying Sybil. She however, manages to evade complete destruction once again. Sybil finds a way to to transfer her mind into a monitor, which provides a projection of her former physical body, and finds herself in the company of [[Nathaniel Malick]]. One of her robots, also manage to escape the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D., and collects the time stream, which is handed to Malick.\n\nWith the time stream back in her possession, Sibyl reclaims her powers of foresight. She then directs Nathaniel to Afterlife, a sanctuary for [[Inhumans]] in [[Nepal]]. She has him save [[Kora]], an Inhuman, who was set to commit suicide. Nathaniel recruits Kora to join his cause, and Sibyl gives the two, knowledge of the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., who are directly opposing them. Based on Sibyl's prediction, she has Nathaniel recruit various people, who all go against S.H.I.E.L.D. at one point in the future, including a scientist, who is able to upgrade her physical body. Sybil also makes various scenarios, to see how she and Malick can win their fight, against S.H.I.E.L.D. and finds that [[Leo Fitz]] is present in every scenario in which they're defeated in.\n\nOne of Nathaniel's recuits include [[Deathlok (John Garrett)|John Garrett]], an enemy of S.H.I.E.L.D. who goes on to die at the hands of [[Phil Coulson]]. Sibyl shows him his future fate, in order to convince him to join her cause.\n\nSibyl discloses to Nathaniel, that many years ago, she contacted her home planet. She has Nathaniel take the ''Zephyr One'' into space, so he can contact them. Kora allows herself to be captured and taken to the Lighthouse. There, she takes out it's main power source, and lowers their firewalls, allowing Sibyl invade their system. She greets Coulson through a message on the screen, and plans on, killing him, just as he killed her hunters. She browses through the S.H.I.E.L.D. database, in an effort to obtain as much information as possible on the organization. When the power is reactivated, the firewall return, banishing Sibyl, but she manages to acquire data, including the locations of various S.H.I.E.L.D. bases. When the Chronicoms arrive in Earth's atmosphere, Sibyl provides them with the locations of the S.H.I.E.L.D. bases, to target, and the fleet fire, destroying them all.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n*\"[[Alien Commies from the Future!]]\"\n*\"[[A Trout in the Milk]]\" (mentioned)\n*\"[[Adapt or Die]]\"\n*\"[[The Totally Excellent Adventures of Mack and the D]]\"\n*\"[[After, Before]]\" (mentioned)\n{{Col-2}}\n*\"[[Stolen]]\" (mentioned)\n*\"[[Brand New Day (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Brand New Day]]\"\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sibyl shares her name with the oracles of Ancient Greece, who like her, could predict future events.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x11 - Brand New Day - Photography - Sibyl.jpg\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x13 - What We're Fight For - Sibyl.jpg\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x13 - What We're Fight For - Sibyl 2.jpg\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x13 - What We're Fight For - Sibyl and Chronicoms.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]"
