He is very dumb, but a little smarter than Clubber, having a bit more personality than him. He does whatever Uriah does, and likes insulting people for some reason. He took the drums when he was six and quit when he was seven, but his short drum lessons actually helped The Dunnsters during the Battle of the Bands. He likes skateboarding a lot, and got entranced by Stacey who is Nerissa in reality in \"[[T is for Trauma]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nK Is For Knowledge (4).jpg\nK Is For Knowledge (5).jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Van Buren Kurt}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
