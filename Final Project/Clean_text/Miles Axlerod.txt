with Lucius electrical system and Whitworth bolts According the film DVD commentary the scene where Mater comes Buckingham Palace and reveals Axlerod actual personality and his plan make the lemons rich had been used production earlier than any other scene result Pixar went backwards make the scenes where looks Axlerod good guy make the viewers figure out the end that Mater brilliant after all his silliness throughout the film This manner his exposure villain similar that the Scooby Doo franchise where most the time their villains were not fully revealed until the end Before coming with Axlerod Pixar had considered Russian super car called Zil the main villain likely after the former Russian car manufacturer ZiL and homaging the James Bond tradition setting stories Cold War related environments There are several easy miss signs that foreshadow Axlerod true nature and evil plot During his interview the Mel Dorado show Axlerod eagerly says that oil costs big fortune hinting his greed and saying how alternative energy the way for future and would have use gasoline the end World Grand Prix hinting not really supporting the usage alternative fuel and that his invention Allinol actually engineered gasoline While speaking Mater the party Japan Axlerod eyes widen the sound oil leaking when quickly says that Mater had leaked oil This implied that Axlerod realized had leaked oil and blamed Mater order hide the fact not truly electric car This comes back light when Mater realizes that Axlerod had leaked oil while realizing that Axlerod the Lemons mysterious mastermind After

dark green paint job lightly visible underneath pale green padding After major crash during the second race Axlerod rushes speak the press hinting that Axlerod had quickly change into his public persona can discredit the usage Allinol the next race Before discredits the use Allinol Axlerod says cannot risk the lives the racecars without sounding completely concerned This foreshadows Axlerod does not truly care about what happens the racecars they use his fuel and was even willing murder Lightning McQueen for when decides use Allinol just prove the safety alternative fuel also foreshadows that Axlerod does not truly care about the lives anyone but his own was forced deactivate his own bomb just save himself When speaking McQueen before the race London tells him has hopes him winning and expectations him proving that Allinol safe This implies that Axlerod wants McQueen participate the race just can killed and prevent him from backing out order find Mater whom Axlerod minions had managed capture When Mater and McQueen arrive Buckingham Palace before Axlerod exposed Axlerod looks shocked see McQueen and Mater the latter informs Queen Elizabeth and Scotland Yard knows who sabotaging the World Grand Prix Axlerod had planned kill both Mater and McQueen for interfering with his plans and looked shocked see them still alive when they arrived Buckingham Palace known the most sinister Cars villain Axlerod personality very similar that Waternoose the main antagonists Monsters Inc which was released ten years before both are portrayed evil businessmen who are originally introduced being friendly both rely deception part their motivations and both are ultimately defeated being exposed the heroes villains and being subsequently arrested Axlerod never revealed his true nature because Mater revealed for him was also willing kill Mater gruesomely installing bomb his air filter This makes him the darkest Pixar villains Males"
