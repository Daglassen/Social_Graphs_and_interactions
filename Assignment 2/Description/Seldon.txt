Let's get you a good ol' fashioned dose of Hateno hospitality! The shop is in my daughter's capable hands these days, so I've got a lot of time on my hands. I thought it might be nice to do a good turn for the village where I was born and raised, so I volunteered as a tour guide. Stick with me, and I'll show you around the best parts of this place. In fact, in just a minute, I'll show you something really special!|Seldon|BotW}}</ref> In his free time, he offers Seldon's Village Tours for travelers visiting {{Term|BotW|Hateno Village}}.<ref>{{Cite|You've got the look of a traveler!
