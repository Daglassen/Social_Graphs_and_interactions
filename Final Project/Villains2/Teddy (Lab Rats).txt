He is the variation of\u00a0[[Eddy (Lab Rats)|Eddy]]\u00a0when he gets exposed to a virus.\n\n==Personality==\nTeddy is very cruel and evil. His\u00a0personality is pretty much the same of\u00a0Eddy; he loves causing trouble and loves watching people get in trouble or struggle. However, Teddy is more violent, and does not like anyone, even\u00a0Donald. He loves tormenting, scaring, and taunting people.\n\n==Night of the Living Virus==\nHis only appearance so far is in\u00a0\"Night of the Living Virus\", when\u00a0Eddy is exposed to a virus. Leo becomes [[Chase Davenport|Chase]]'s lab assistant because [[Tasha Davenport|Tasha]] is tired of\u00a0Leo playing video games all day which she claims will \"rot your brain.\" Donald gets annoyed at\u00a0Leo\u00a0and gives him the task of watching a download for five hours.\u00a0Leo\u00a0hacks into the software to try to speed up the download, but accidentally releases a powerful internet virus, which results in\u00a0Eddy becoming a demon named Teddy.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lab Rats characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
