He was able to escape and forced to live in the sewers. Since then, Scarlet Spider held a personal vendetta against Dr. Octopus for what he did to him. In the episode \"Force of Nature,\" Scarlet Spider meets Aunt May while trying to get her away from Hydro-Man's rampage. When unmasked, Scarlet Spider has a scar on his face and states that he doesn't have a name. Aunt May names him Ben. Ben is revealed to be a spy of Doctor Octopus all along, not Rhino, making him the seventh member of Sinister Six's succeeding team, Sinister Seven, and reveals to Doctor Octopus Spider-Man's true identity.\n\nDoctor Octopus revealed that he took Scarlet Spider in and gave him his powers as he sends him to get the key to Dr. Curt Connors' latest invention from Aunt May's house. Flash Thompson in an advanced wheelchair had to work to keep Scarlet Spider from obtaining the key as Aunt May tries to reason with her. This fails even when Spider-Man arrives. Upon getting the key to Doctor Octopus, Scarlet Spider watches as Doctor Octopus uses the invention to turn HYDRA Island into Octopus Island. Upon Aunt May getting captured by Doctor Octopus, Scarlet Spider is persuaded by Aunt May to help Spider-Man. Scarlet Spider and Spider-Man fight off Doctor Octopus who gets away. Without Doctor Octopus, Octopus Island starts to fall to the ground. After shooting an escape pod with Spider-Man and Aunt May out of Octopus Island, Scarlet Spider pilots Octopus Island where it crashes into the harbor after confirming with Peter that's what Ben Parker would do, sacrifice himself for the greater good. Spider-Man,\u00a0Iron Spider, and\u00a0Kid Arachnid\u00a0were unable to find Scarlet Spider's body.\n\nHowever, Scarlet managed to escape and purposely hid from the team to find answers about his past, where he eventually ends up following an early experiment to one of Dr. Octopus's old bases and saves Peter and Mary Jane from getting killed by Kaine. He eventually finds out that he is actually a synthezoid and was meant to lead a team of Spider-Slayers, and was almost manipulated by Arnim Zola into eliminating Spider-Man and the web warriors, but through Spider-Man's support he ended up helping Spider-Man and his team defeat Zola and escape from the abandoned Hydra Island.\n\nHe eventually reunites with S.H.I.E.L.D Academy and ends up becoming a tutor.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Unlike most of his incarnations, who are actually clones, this Scarlet Spider is a synthezoid.\n*This Scarlet Spider is modeled after the [[Wikipedia:Kaine Parker|Kaine]] version of the character in the original comics. Despite this, he is given the name Ben Reilly, while the name Kaine applies to another synthezoid clone of Spider-Man who looks paler and possesses multiple arms.\n*When the lower half of his mask is pulled up, it reveals he has a jawline similar to Spider-Man's.\n*Like his Ultimate comic book counterpart, Scarlet Spider was created by [[Doctor Octopus]].\n*The Ben Reilly version of the Scarlet Spider was alluded to by Flash Thompson, who temporarily used the Scarlet Spider name (shortly before turning into Agent Venom).\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nScarlet Spider USM 01.png\nScarlet Spider USM 02.png\nScarlet Spider USM 03.png\nScarlet Spider USM 04.png\nScarlet Spider USM 05.png\nScarlet Spider USM 06.png\nScarlet Spider USM 07.png\nScarlet Spider USM 08.png\nScarlet Spider USM 09.png\nScarlet Spider USM 10.png\nUSM_Scarlet_Spider_Unmasked.png\nScarlet Spider USM 11.png\nScarlet Spider USM 12.png\nScarlet Spider USM 13.png\nScarlet Spider USM 14.png\nScarlet Spider USM 15.png\nScarlet Spider USM 16.png\nScarlet Spider USM 17.png\nScarlet Spider USM 18.png\nScarlet Spider USM 19.png\nScarlet Spider USM 20.png\nWeb Warrior USM 01.png\nWeb Warrior USM 03.png\nWeb Warrior USM 02.png\nWeb Warrior USM 06.png\nAgent Venom Sinister 6 20.png\nWeb Warrior USM 07.png\nWeb Warrior USM 06png.png\nScarlet Spider USM 21.png\nScarlet Spider USM 22.png\nScarlet Spider USM 23.png\nScarlet Spider USM 24.png\nScarlet Spider USM 25.png\nScarlet Spider USM 26.png\nScarlet Spider USM 27.png\nScarlet Spider USM 28.png\nScarlet Spider USM 29.png\nScarlet Spider USM 30.png\nScarlet Spider USM 31.png\nUltimateSpiderMan-411-BenReilly.png\nWeb Warrior USM 8.png\nWeb Warrior USM 9.png\nAgent Venom USM 8.png\nWeb Warrior USM 10.png\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x05 - Lizards - Spider-Man, Agent Venom, Miles Morales, Scarlet Spider and Iron Spider.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x05 - Lizards - Iron Spider, Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Scarlet Spider and Agent Venom.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x05 - Lizards - Agent Venom, Scarlet Spider- Miles Morales, Spider-Man and Iron Spider.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x06 - Double Agent Venom - Spider-Man, Agent Venom and Scarlet Spider.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x06 - Double Agent Venom - Scarlet Spider and Spider-Man.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x06 - Double Agent Venom - Scarlet Spider and Kraven the Hunter.jpg\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x21 - Spider Slayers, Part One - Spider-Man, Scarlet Spider and Ultimate Spider-Woman 2.png\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x21 - Spider Slayers, Part One - Spider-Man, Scarlet Spider and Ultimate Spider-Woman.png\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x21 - Spider Slayers, Part One - Scarlet Spider and Ultimate Spider-Woman.png\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x25 - Graduation Day, Part One - Scarlet Spider, Iron Spider, Spider-Man, Agent Venom, Ultimate Spider-Woman and Miles Morales.png\nUltimate Spider-Man - 4x25 - Graduation Day, Part One - Agent Venom, Scarlet Spider, Spider-Man, Iron Spider, Ultimate Spider-Woman and Miels Morales.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
