He is a weapons expert who brandishes a specially designed whip as his personal weapon. He also appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as the main antagonist of the 2010 film ''Iron Man 2 ''and later as one of the antagonists in''\u00a0[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\nWhiplash was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Gene Colan.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe===\n====''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''====\nFollowing Ivan Vanko's death, Marc Scarlotti becomes the new Whiplash. He is a [[HYDRA]] agent who attacked the United Nations. He uses a combination of bladed whips and weapons called \"splinter bombs\". He manages to kill Noelle Walters and injure [[Glenn Talbot]], but he is ultimately defeated by [[Melinda May]], after which he is arrested and imprisoned by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n===Marvel Animated Universe===\n====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====\nA version of the unnamed female Whiplash appears in this series. As the Breakout occurred, she was among the prisoners getting their weapons and suits back in the Vault's armory when the Living Laser ripped the door open for them.\n\nThen she was with the other villains bent on taking revenge on Iron Man for locking them up in the Vault. As Blizzard was about to kill him with his freeze ray, they were stopped by Hawkeye.\n\nAfter being saved by Hawkeye, Iron Man then set the Vault in self-destruct and escaped. Whiplash escaped before the Vault exploded.\n\nWhen the Avengers fought her, she had Black Panther tied up with her lashes. Hawkeye freed Panther and Whiplash destroyed all the lights. She tried to attack Hawkeye from behind but Panther warned him and Hawkeye fired an arrow at her, freezing her. Whiplash was then imprisoned.\n\n===''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]''===\nA comical version of Whiplash appears in ''Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel'' as one of the villains in [[Red Skull]]'s group.\n\n===''Avengers Assemble''===\nHe crashes a museum event that contains the new Avengers exhibit and ensnares the Avengers in his upgraded whips. Hulk manages to break free and yank Whiplash off the balcony. With a combination of Black Widow using water to short out his whips and Hulk performing a power clap, Whiplash was defeated. Iron Man's analysis of the fragment of Whiplash's whip showed that it was upgraded by A.I.M. who has been siphoning 30th Century technology that belonged to Kang the Conqueror.\n\n===''Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers''===\n{{Stub}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The Whiplash in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'' is visually based on the one seen in the ''Iron Man: Armored Adventures'' series.\n\n==Gallery==\n=== ''Iron Man 2'' ===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nWhiplash-IM2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' ===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nWhiplash (Marc Scarlotti).png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel''===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nMission Marvel - Whiplash.png\nVillains cause mayhem.jpg\nStompingflowerbed.jpg\nAvengers assemble2.jpg\nCrosswalk.jpg\nVenom-RedSkull-MODOK-and-Whiplash.jpg\nHeinz-RedSkull-Venom-MODOK-and-Whiplash.jpg\nRedSkull-Venom-MODOK-Heinz-andWhiplash.JPEG\n</gallery>\n\n===''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes''===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nLeeann Foreman (Earth-80920).jpg|The female Whiplash from [[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]].\nWhiplash AEMH 1.png\nWhiplash AEMH.png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers''===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nWhiplash DWA.jpg|Whiplash from [[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Video Games===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nWhiplash-iOS.png|Whiplash in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n===Comics===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\n3230941-emh00109.jpg\nAnton Vanko (Whiplash) (Earth-616) 0002.jpg\nWhiplash Avanko main.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Iron Man characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
