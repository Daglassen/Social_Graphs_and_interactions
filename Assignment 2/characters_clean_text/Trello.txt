Trello is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Trello is the father of Rivan and the grandfather of Dunma. Like many elderly Zora, Trello holds resentment towards any Hylians, including Link, for Mipha's death. He refrains from attacking Link due to having his hands full trying to figure out what to do about Divine Beast Vah Ruta.
Once Vah Ruta has been calmed, Trello will respect Link instead of shaming him.  Since retiring, Trello is in charge of the Champion Festival and bears the Ceremonial Trident. As part of the Shrine Quest "The Ceremonial Song", Trello can be approached by Link about the Ceremonial Trident. He reveals that the trident used in the Champion Festival is a replica of Mipha's Lightscale Trident. He admits that he dropped the trident off the bridge while taking it for Dento to examine. However, he doesn't care much for it since it's fake, and decides to ask Dento to make a new one.
