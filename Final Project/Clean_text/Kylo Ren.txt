people think that might never have become with the Force and thus has Force spirit either due the lack training and because the dyad with Rey somehow prevents him while she still alive When asked why Force spirit Ben Anakin was not included the final scene Chris Terrio explained that they chose include only Luke and Leia because they wanted focus the twins reunion Tatooine and Leia first appearance spirit According the Visual effects team the film Force spirit Ben Solo was never created The Star Wars Book confirms this listing the status all the Jedi who died and became Force spirits with the Force but Ben Solo the only listed converted the light side and deceased indicating that never became with the Force and thus has Force spirit Both The Star Wars Book and Skywalker Family War state that Leia ferried Ben into the Cosmic Force the realm beyond the living although the first book she listed with the Force while isn any case this rules out the possibility that his soul might have fused with Rey after died Since the three part episode Ben Solo and the Bug Hunters the Star Wars Kids Youtube channel the character has been frequently associated with blue butterflies the fans
