It is introduced as one of the few Beagle Boys that has never been caught, hence the number 0.\n\nHe first appeared in the [[Tony Strobl]] story A Lesson from Uncle Zero. \n\n==History==\nIn the first debut story, Uncle Zero will instruct his grandchildren even managing to deceive Scrooge by selling him a stolen diamond from the London museum.  However, his record of missed catch will end soon when he is arrested (along with his grandchildren) by the British secret services.  Even in subsequent stories the record will continue to be broken and, after trying to deceive [[Super Goof]] and captured by the superhero, he will find himself in prison with the number 13-13.\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
