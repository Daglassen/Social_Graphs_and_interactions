They shoot fireballs at Link, which can only be deflected with the [[Red Shield|Red]] and [[Mirror Shield]]s. They can only be damaged with the [[Magic Hammer]], [[Silver Arrow]]s, a [[Spin Attack]] from the [[Master Sword]], or an attack from any of its upgrades.\n\n==={{OoS|-}}===\nLynels appear in red and blue variations in {{OoS}}. They also shoot fireballs at Link. A [[Golden Lynel]] appears in the [[Tarm Ruins]] during [[Winter]] after talking to the golden-robed [[Old Man]]. Defeating the Golden Lynel alongside the other [[Golden Monster]]s rewards Link with the [[Red Ring]].\n\n==={{OoA|-}}===\n{{Stub}}\nLynels appear in red and blue variations in {{OoA}}.\n\n==={{ALBW|-}}===\nLynels appear in two variations in {{ALBW}}, a white-maned type found on Death Mountain and a black variant with an orange mane that is found in the [[Treacherous Tower]]. They attack by breathing a long stream of fire that takes three hearts,{{Verify}} which can only be blocked with the [[Hylian Shield]].\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\n{{Compendium/Extract|Lynel}}\n[[File:BotW Perfect Guard.png|thumb|right|200px|Link using a Perfect Guard against a Lynel]]\nLynels appear in five different variations in {{BotW}}, including the standard red-maned Lynels, [[Blue-Maned Lynel]]s, [[White-Maned Lynel]]s, [[Silver Lynel]]s, and the [[Master Mode]] exclusive [[Golden Lynel]]s. With the exception of the Lynel on [[Ploymus Mountain]], after spotting [[Link]], a Lynel will often refrain from attacking for a short period of time and instead stare him down. This allows Link to escape before it initiates a battle. Lynels exclusively use weapons of the {{Term|BotW|Lynel Gear|link}} equipment archetype, of which they are the sole source. The only exception to this is the Lynel encountered in the [[Coliseum Ruins]], which carries a [[Flameblade]] when encountered as a [[Silver Lynel]]. Depending on their location, Lynels can wield a [[Lynel Sword|Sword]] and [[Lynel Shield|Shield]] combo, a [[Lynel Spear|Spear]], or a [[Lynel Crusher|Crusher]]. They also wield a [[Lynel Bow|Bow]] that is equipped with either [[Arrow|Regular Arrow]]s (only at [[Gerudo Summit]]), [[Fire Arrow]]s, [[Ice Arrow]]s, [[Shock Arrow]]s, or [[Bomb Arrow]]s (only on the [[Great Plateau]] in [[Master Mode]]). Though Lynel Spears and Lynel Crushers are two-handed Weapons, Lynels are capable of wielding them with one hand.\n\nLynels have a variety of attacks, both ranged and melee, such as shooting fireballs, body slamming, dashing, and trampling. Lynels also have the ability to teleport, doing so to either briefly flee from battle or to give chase after Link. Link can perform a {{Term|BotW|Perfect Dodging|link|display=Perfect Dodge}} or a [[Perfect Guard]] on most of their attacks, leaving them vulnerable for counterattacks. He can also utilize the wind gusts created by their fire attacks to [[Paraglider|glide]] up and shoot an [[Arrow]] at their head, stunning them and inflicting double damage. Link can temporarily mount Lynels either by sneaking up from behind, jumping on while they are stunned, using the [[Paraglider]] to drop onto them from above, or immediately after they perform a dashing Sword swipe or charge at Link. While mounted, Link can repeatedly attack the Lynel up to five times with any Weapon without it losing any Durability. If Link's [[Stamina]] runs out however, he will be thrown off and lose a quarter of a [[Heart]]. Though they can be mounted, they cannot be soothed. If Link dies while attempting to mount a Lynel, the Lynel will roar.\n\nEvery kind of Lynel from red to golden are completely immune to all elemental types<ref>A hit with a Royal Bow using normal arrows deal 38 damage to any Lynel. A hit from an arrow with an element attached to it will also deal 38 damage. This was tested with all 3 elemental arrow types.</ref>. That includes the additional damage and the effect an element would normally inflict. It is therefore pointless to use offensives like elemental arrows and elemental melee weapons whilst fighting them. The only exception to this is [[Urbosa's Fury]] which does not abide by this rule.\n\nWhen defeated, Lynels drop their [[Lynel Hoof|Hooves]], [[Lynel Horn|Horns]], and [[Lynel Guts|Guts]], along with their Weapons and a bundle of their Arrows. Silver and Golden Lynels occasionally drop [[Gem]]s and [[Star Fragment]]s as well. A total of 22 Lynels can be found throughout Hyrule. An additional Lynel also appears on the [[Great Plateau]] in [[Master Mode]]. Two Lynels also appear in the [[Trial of the Sword]].\n\nLink can buy a [[Lynel Mask]] for 999 [[Mon]] from [[Kilton]]'s [[Fang and Bone]] shop after completing three [[Divine Beast]]s. It can be used to temporarily avoid being attacked by Lynels.<ref>{{Cite|Kilton's handmade Lynel headgear. It's so well crafted, it can deceive a real Lynel.

Before [[Link]], [[Princess Zelda]] and [[Sing]] made their way to Ganon's lair, where Link must fight a pair of Lynels, one blue and one red. The hero blocks their attacks and then proceeds to [[Sword Beam|zap]] both of them, with one of them dropping a [[Recorder]] that allows them to escape the [[Underworld]] later on in the episode. [[Blue Lynel]]s also appear as part of the [[Brotherhood of Underworld Monsters]] in ''[[The Moblins are Revolting]]'' firing their projectiles a little too early on the [[Moblin]] leader's command before Link and Zelda leave for the Underworld.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==={{TLoZ|-}} (Valiant Comics)===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\nIn the {{TLoZ|Valiant Comics}}, Lynels appear in the \"[[Day of the Triforce]]\" story.
