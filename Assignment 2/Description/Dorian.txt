Please, friend... Go ahead and step inside.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Cado}} and {{Term|BotW|Dorian}} will step aside to allow {{Term|BotW|Link}} passage and Dorian reveals that for ages {{Term|BotW|Impa}} has been waiting for his return.<ref>{{Cite|Lady Impa has been waiting on you for a long time.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> While he wishes to speak to {{Term|BotW|Link}} as well, he asks that the hero first see the elder.<ref>{{Cite|There is much I would like to tell you as well... But first, please hurry and see what Lady Impa has to say.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref>\n\n{{Term|BotW|Dorian}} implores {{Term|BotW|Link}} to use the {{Term|BotW|Sheikah|link}} {{Term|BotW|Kakariko Village|display=Village}}'s resources to his advantage.<ref>{{Cite|If you need anything, please find it here in our village. The {{Color|BotW Blue|clothing shop}}, {{Color|BotW Blue|materials shop}}, {{Color|BotW Blue|general shop}}, and {{Color|BotW Blue|inn}} should be able to provide everything you need.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> He also mentions the {{Term|BotW|Ta'loh Naeg Shrine|link}} on a hill above his settlement,<ref>{{Cite|Oh, and just between you and me, there's also a {{Color|BotW Red|shrine}} in the hills of this village.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> as well as the {{Term|BotW|Great Fairy Fountain|link}}, which he refers to as the location of {{Term|BotW|Kakariko Village}}'s {{Term|BotW|Cotera|link|display=Guardian Spirit}}.<ref>{{Cite|They say up and behind those hills resides Kakariko's {{Color|BotW Blue|guardian spirit}}.

It's said that she offers a special blessing to those that visit her...

Monsters roam around at night. It's way too dangerous to wander around. There's an {{Color|BotW Blue|inn}} in this village.

It's gotten so late.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> At home, {{Term|BotW|Dorian}} will take a seat and remove his umbrella hat.

If only I had been able to stop them...|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> Eventually, {{Term|BotW|Dorian}} will fall asleep in his chair.\n\nAt 8:00 AM, Dorian will wake up and go to tell his daughters stories.<ref>{{Cite|I'm off to meet my daughters. I'm going to tell them stories about our village under the tree my wife so loved.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> However, he admits that those stories are always the same.<ref>{{Cite|My stories are always the same though. I hope they don't mind!|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> If {{Term|BotW|Link}} speaks to the family while they are under the favourite {{Term|BotW|Tree|link}} of {{Term|BotW|Dorian}}' wife, {{Term|BotW|Dorian}} will introduce his girls.<ref name=\"Daughters\"/> While he loves their time together, he admits that he only ends up repeating stories to them.<ref>{{Cite|Any moment I can spend with my girls is a gift. I always end up boring them with the same stories, though.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> If {{Term|BotW|Link}} asks about these stories, {{Term|BotW|Dorian}} will share one of them.<ref>{{Cite|There's a {{Color|BotW Red|shrine}} right above this hill, guarding the Sheikah tribe. Sometimes from {{Color|BotW Red|the forest behind it}}, you can hear... {{Big|a woman sobbing!}} ...Heh! That's the story I'm telling the children right now, anyway.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> Quietly, he'll admit to {{Term|BotW|Link}} that he is talking about where the {{Term|BotW|Kakariko Village|display=Village}}'s {{Term|BotW|Cotera|display=Guardian Spirit}} is and that he is trying to keep the girls from going there.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|Actually, the location I speak of is where the village's {{Color|BotW Blue|guardian spirit}} resides.

Well, if it isn't Master Link. I'll go back to guarding Lady Impa's home now. The {{Color|BotW Blue|Yiga Clan}} has been snooping around, so please be careful, Master Link.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen the {{Term|BotW|Sheikah Heirloom|link}} has been stolen from {{Term|BotW|Paya|link}}, Dorian asks Link go and comfort her.<ref>{{Cite|Someone snuck in and stole Lady Paya's most prized possession... I'm sure Lady Paya would feel a little more at ease if she saw Master Link's face.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> According to Paya, Dorian and Cado claim not to have seen anyone aside from the villagers of Kakariko.<ref>{{Cite|I checked with Dorian and Cado, but they said they didn't see anyone other that the villagers around.|Paya|BotW}}</ref> While the {{Term|BotW|Shrine Quest|link}} \"{{Term|BotW|The Stolen Heirloom|link}}\" is active, Dorian wonders who could have stolen the Heirloom, stating he saw nobody suspicious.<ref>{{Cite|But who could have stolen the {{Color|BotW Blue|heirloom}}? There were some people visiting the manor, but they were all known villagers. I don't remember seeing anyone suspicious.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> Link can ask who visited Impa's House, and Dorian will tell him {{Term|BotW|Lasli|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Mellie|link}} came by.<ref>{{Cite|[Who came by?] The only people who came by yesterday were... {{Color|BotW Blue|Lasli}} from the clothing shop and {{Color|BotW Blue|Grandma Mellie}} from the plum garden. That's about it. I didn't see anyone else.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt 10:00 in the evening, Dorian will make his way to the woods past Ta'loh Naeg Shrine. If Link speaks to him during this time, Dorian is startled by his presence.<ref>{{Cite|Whoa! Well if it isn't Master Link. What are you doing wandering around in the dead of night?|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> He struggles to come up with a reason why he's out,<ref>{{Cite|[What are you doing?] Me? Um... I was just... The village...|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> but he eventually claims that he was patrolling the village for the thief.<ref>{{Cite|Yes! I was patrolling the village! The thief could be hiding anywhere, you know!|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> However, he decides to return to his post, as leaving Cado alone is dangerous.<ref>{{Cite|But I should probably get back to my post. Leaving Cado alone on guard duty is dangerous. Stay safe out there.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring his walk, Dorian wonders how \"they\" could have done this and states he must do something.<ref>{{Cite|How could they?|Dorian|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I must do something.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> In the woods, he comments about how quiet it is,<ref>{{Cite|Sure is quiet out here...|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> but he hears something as he approaches the {{Term|BotW|Stone Sphere Socket|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|What was that?!|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> He decides he must be imagining things,<ref>{{Cite|Must be imagining things.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> but once he's over the bridge, he demands an unknown entity to show themself.<ref>{{Cite|Show yourself!|Dorian|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Link approaches, Dorian repeats his demand.<ref>{{Cite|I know you're there! Show yourself!|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> A {{Term|BotW|Yiga Blademaster|link}} appears on the Stone Sphere Socket.<ref>{{Cite|You don't have to shout. I'm right here.|Yiga Blademaster|BotW}}</ref> Dorian accuses the Yiga of stealing the Sheikah Heirloom,<ref>{{Cite|So you're the ones who stole the heirloom!|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> which the Blademaster confirms and notes that it seems special to the village.<ref>{{Cite|Heh... Such anger. It seems this thing is truly special to the fools of this village.|Yiga Blademaster|BotW}}</ref> Dorian questions why they would steal it,<ref>{{Cite|Why would you steal it?|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> but the Blademaster tells him not to play dumb and he knew what he was getting into.<ref>{{Cite|Don't play dumb, Dorian. You knew what you were getting yourself into when you decided to leave the organization.|Yiga Blademaster|BotW}}</ref> He informs Dorian that by leaving, he's forfeited his life.<ref>{{Cite|You forfeited your life the moment you left.|Yiga Blademaster|BotW}}</ref> After telling them about the Heirloom, his usefulness has come to an end.<ref>{{Cite|You did well to tell us about the heirloom. Unfortunately, your usefulness has come to an end, as must you. But first...|Yiga Blademaster|BotW}}</ref> However, the Blademaster notices Link nearby, and chooses to attack him first.<ref>{{Cite|It appears we have an audience!|Yiga Blademaster|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter the {{Term|BotW|Yiga}} thief is defeated, {{Term|BotW|Dorian}} expresses shock that he was followed.<ref>{{Cite|I can't believe I was being followed.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> He reveals that he used to be part of the {{Term|BotW|Yiga|display=Clan}} himself before he met his wife and had his daughters.<ref>{{Cite|I am...a member of the Yiga Clan. Or I used to be, anyway. But then I met the most incredible woman who blessed me with two amazing children.|Dorian|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Dorian}} tried to change his ways and leave the {{Term|BotW|Yiga|display=Yiga Clan}} for the {{Term|BotW|Sheikah|display=Sheikah Tribe}}, but the {{Term|BotW|Yiga}} killed his wife in retaliation.<ref>{{Cite|And so I tried to change my ways. Tried to leave the clan. But the Yiga...
