He can also be very lazy and seems to execute actions and plans with little effort (such as tricking Abis Mal into doing the things he just ordered Haroud to do). Yet despite his seemingly hatred of his boss, he follows his every order and takes part in nearly all of his schemes. He poses a far greater threat on Aladdin and friends being that he is cunning and actually uses his slight physical strength.\n\nHe can be very manipulative\u2014especially towards his boss. He tricked Abis Mal several times into doing his chores (mostly physical work). Since Abis Mal always wants something he often says something along the lines of \"Yes! I shall have the glory of touching the gold first\" considering the gold is being dangerously guarded. This makes Abis Mal jealous; having him go through the traps instead of Haroud. Haroud does, however, also show far better leadership competence than Abis Mal himself and shows more care about their followers. In [[Air Feather Friends]] for example, Haroud tried (and presumably succeeded) advising Mal against decapitating three of his own henchmen after they were ambushed and foiled by [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] after a raid on [[Agrabah]] and, as a result, left behind one of the roc feathers they were using as means of power and disguise, pointing out that continuing to execute his men would eventually leave him without any.\n\nHaroud also has a habit of finishing Abis Mal's sentences and filling the holes to his plans. More often than ever, Haroud will be off to the side as Abis Mal is being subjected to pain or humiliating defeats. EX: [[The Day the Bird Stood Still]]\n\nIf the right opportunity presents itself, he will take it to turn against Abis Mal, such as during\u00a0[[Forget Me Lots]], when he allows Jasmine (who lost her memory and whom they tricked into serving them) to overthrow his boss while he chooses to serve her instead. \u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is a pun on \"How rude has he been.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category: Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"
