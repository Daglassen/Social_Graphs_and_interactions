But after Spidey forgave Ollie, they later rebelled against their leader after they heard about the 10 million dollar reward to those who unmask the webhead from Spidey and were determined to get it.\n\nThis led to a brief battle between three armored villains and two spiders around [[Boston]]. The trio were defeated after the two heroes used the switch-off failsafe to immobilize them. They were later sent to jail.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n640px-Slam_Adams.png\nSalem's_Witch.png\nPlymouth_Rocket.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]"
