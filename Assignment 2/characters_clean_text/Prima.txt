== Biography ==
Prima is the clerk of the Ton Pu Inn and will greet customers as they come in, offering either a regular bed or a downy bed for the night. She is also the object of fellow villager Manny's affections. However, she appears to utterly ignore his existence.
Once the Side Quest "A Gift for My Beloved" has begun, Link can approach Prima behind the counter. Although she is confused by his behavior, Prima attempts to keep a professional demeanor. Link can praise her establishment and she recommends that he return to the other side of the counter so she might set him up with a room. Once Link begins to ask about her interests for Manny, she becomes annoyed and blurts out a lie of wanting one hundred Restless Crickets. Should Link continue to pester her, Prima's irritation grows.
