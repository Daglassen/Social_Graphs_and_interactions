Yiga Footsoldiers are recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Yiga Footsoldiers are members of the Yiga Clan who follow their leader, Master Kohga. They are always hunting Link down, attempting to assassinate him and stop his quest to defeat Calamity Ganon. Yiga Footsoldiers can be found in various places throughout Hyrule Kingdom, usually appearing disguised as travellers, revealing themselves as Yiga Footsoldiers after Link speaks to them.
After defeating Kohga, Yiga Footsoldiers might also appear out of thin air to ambush Link. They will sometimes attempt to entice Link by selling Mighty Bananas, only to attack him regardless. Yiga Footsoldiers will often teleport around the area, levitating and shooting Link with a Duplex Bow. If wielding either a Vicious Sickle or a Demon Carver, they will teleport above Link and Down Thrust into the ground with their weapon, telegraphing the attack with a glowing red ring of nine Hylian letters. These letters parallel the nine Sheikah letters preceding some of Monk Maz Koshia's attacks.
While infiltrating the Yiga Clan Hideout, Yiga Blademasters will summon two Yiga Footsoldiers if Link is spotted. When defeated, Yiga Footsoldiers will teleport away, dropping their weapon and leaving behind a random amount of Mighty Bananas and Rupees.


== Other Appearances ==


== Nomenclature ==


== Trivia ==
It is possible that the Yiga Footsoldiers were inspired by the Ache from The Adventure of Link, since they both disguise themselves as travelers or townspeople before attacking when approached by Link.
Unlike most enemies in Breath of the Wild, Yiga Footsoldiers do not die when they are defeated.
