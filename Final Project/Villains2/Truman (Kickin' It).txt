He is very troublesome, and he threw a tantrum when he saw that the flashdrive of Eddie was gone. His father's company also has a very tight security system and when something is stolen from it, he will throw \"a girl tantrum\", on of which the Wasabi Warriors caught on tape. However, not stooping to Truman's level, they deleted the video at Truman's request. He is portrayed by Reed Alexander who also plays Nevel in iCarly.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Kickin' It characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
