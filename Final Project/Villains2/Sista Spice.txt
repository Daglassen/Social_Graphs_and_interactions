She is [[Suga Mama]]'s older sister, [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] and Bobby's maternal aunt and [[Penny Proud|Penny]], [[BeBe & CeCe Proud|BeBe, and CeCe]]'s paternal great aunt.\n\n==History==\nShe is claimed by Suga Mama that her parents seem to have more attention and caring for her because of her beauty and mental powers and that they didn't even know Suga Mama existed. As Sista Spice arrives in town, she was glad everyone was happy to see her -- except her sister. She sent her flying out of the Proud family house over to Bobby's house. Later, she entertains her great-grandniece Penny and her friends with her powers, she chooses [[Zoey Howzer|Zoey]] as her kin and teaches her how to focus, using her own powers to make it seem like Zoey is psychic. After that, when her show is being held outside in the Proud Snax parking lot since she was rejected by Wizard Kelly from his arena earlier, she attempts to swindle Oscar out of money but was foiled by Wizard Kelly and Suga Mama.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Despite her craftiness, Spice did seem to be a good aunt to Oscar, who was regularly ignored by Sugar and even Bobby.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nSpiceintro.png|Sista Spice during the intro\nsistaspice.png\nspicepower.png\nSpiceoscar.png\nmamaspice.png\nmamaspicepower.png\nSpicejuggle.png\nSistanature.png|Sista Spice's true nature revealed\nsisterfight.png\nSpicepowers.png\nSistaup.png\nSistaspicedefeat.png|Sista Spice's defeat\nSpicenewspaper.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Proud Family}}\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Psychics]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
