As proof of a functioning doomsday device, guaranteed him, Valedictorian. However, he was betrayed by [[Willem Viceroy]], who informed the authorities, and thus he was arrested. At some point, he died, and was reduced to his skeleton in what was apparently a \"funny story\".\n\n==Dawn of the Driscoll==\nFollowing [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]] trying to save his science project, using the Ninja power of healing. Randy lost control of it and accidentally brought Jerry back to life. He went on a rampage and kidnapped [[Howard Weinerman|Howard]]. Randy tried to stop him, but as a skeleton, it soon became clear he couldn't be harmed. He returned to his lab and took Howard. He revealed he thought he was Viceroy, as Howard was dressed as him, at the time. After revealing that he wasn't Jerry, decided to keep him so he could watch him activate the doomsday device, still planning on achieving Valedictorian. Randy and the real Viceroy confronted him in his lab, having activated the doomsday device, and took Randy on with a laser staff. Randy managed to stop him, by removing his head, thus disabling him. However, Viceroy was unable to stop the doomsday device. At that moment his wife arrived and managed to convince Jerry not to destroy the world. But of course, Jerry decided to move on to try and destroy the universe. As such, he was deemed too dangerous, and Randy undid the spell, returning him to death.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*He likes to make Halloween or skeleton-related puns.\n**Even though he's dead, Mrs. Driscoll makes him say a lot of skeleton puns as well.\n*With the exception of \"Dawn of the Driscoll\", he is a lifeless skeleton.\n*The fact that his skeleton was able to come back to life means Marlene Driscoll actually carts around a real human skeleton.\n*In \"[[M-M-M-my Bologna]]\" he is the third person to trip Randy Cunningham when he's running through the halls of Norrisville High, after Howard and Band Instructor respectively.\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Driscoll, Jerry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
