Dantz is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Dantz is a Hylian who works at Hateno Pasture in Hateno Village. He carries a Farmer's Pitchfork, which he uses to move hay. When Link first approaches him, Dantz asks if he's a wanderer. He mutters to himself that this could work, noting Link looks like he can use a Bow and asking if he could help.
If Link agrees, Dantz claims that he's the answer to his prayers. He explains that he needs Link to hunt the Mountain Bucks in Retsam Forest, since they're overpopulated and destroying the Forest. He gives Link a time limit of one minute.
Dantz wants to know if Link can start hunting right away. If Link asks if there's a trick, Dantz suggests using a strong Bow. He also advises sneaking up to deer without them noticing. Dantz calls Link a trooper and asserts that he's counting on him.
Before the Deer Hunting Mini-Game starts, Dantz says he'll call Link once the minute is over. When time is up, Link will appear back at the start.
If Link fails to get a single deer, Dantz refuses to give him any reward. He gives him one Rupees for getting one to three deer as thanks for doing his part. If he gets four to six deer, Dantz calls Link vicious and rewards him with a Blue Rupee. For seven to nine deer, Dantz admits that's more than he thought and gives him a Red Rupee. Dantz is shocked if Link gets all ten deer, saying there's such a thing as being too good at hunting and giving him a Purple Rupee.
