When engineer\u00a0[[Arthur Chaney]] took over the team after the former coach,\u00a0[[Coach Barker|Joe Barker]] was caught pelting\u00a0Tom Stewart\u00a0with basketballs when he struggled to catch passes during a game, Larry continued to serve as the team's star player, until Arthur benched him during a game for being a ball hog and replaces him with Josh. Buck left the gym with him, angered with Arthur's decision.\n\nLarry returned as a rival of the Timberwolves championship game, where\u00a0Tom\u00a0revealed to Josh that Buck moved the family to\u00a0Spokane\u00a0to play on the opposing\u00a0Warriors\u00a0team where Larry (or more specifically Buck) wouldn't be stopped from being the star player. Larry and the Warriors were able to take on an early lead, until\u00a0[[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]]\u00a0returned and helped the Timberwolves catch up. Larry purposely fouled Buddy, who managed to make both free throw shots anyways, and also got Larry back by headbutting him in the groin and stealing the ball from him. The Timberwolves won the championship, with Larry finally congratulating Josh for his game-winning shot, referring to him as the \"waterboy\" again, but in good nature this time.\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
