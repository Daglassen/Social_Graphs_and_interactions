In fact, it represents [[James Trotter|James]]' fear.\n\n==Biography==\n===In the [[wikipedia:James and the Giant Peach|book]]===\nOriginally, In the book, the rhino is actually just a normal rhinoceros that had escaped from the [[London]]\u00a0Zoo, though it nevertheless was responsible for killing James' parents (with the book erroneously claiming it ate them).\n\n===In ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''===\nIn the film, the rhino appeared out of nowhere and ate James' parents, causing him to end up in the hands of his two abusive aunts [[Aunt Spiker|Spiker]] and [[Aunt Sponge|Sponge]]. It is unknown whether it was once a real rhinoceros when it killed James' parents or if it is just a spirit haunting James (more likely the second one since rhinoceroses are herbivores and do not eat meat).\n\nWhen James and his bug friends finally reach [[New York City]], the rhino appears (and finds out that James has escaped from Spiker and Sponge) and slows down their progress. Slowly, it approaches the giant peach, using the power of fear. When James manages to muster up the courage to say he is no longer afraid of the rhino, it weakly shoots its final lightning bolt at [[Giant Peach|the giant peach]] until the clouds (along with the rhino) dissolve away and he dies.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although he is the secondary antagonist, the Rhino turned out to be even more dangerous than [[Aunt Spiker|Spiker]] and [[Aunt Sponge|Sponge]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{James and the Giant Peach}}\n[[Category:James and the Giant Peach characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]"
