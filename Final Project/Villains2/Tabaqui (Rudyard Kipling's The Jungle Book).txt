Along with [[Buldeo (Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book)|Buldeo]], Tabaqui had ties to the village's underbelly.\n\nTabaqui is first seen after Buldeo assists in [[Mowgli]]'s arrest by knocking the boy out after he eludes the British troops. Buldeo finds a jeweled dagger on Mowgli's person and is intrigued by it and knows that it comes from the mythical City of Hanuman. But Boone approaches and takes the \"queen's evidence\" off the reluctant hunter and while Boone and [[Lieutenant Wilkins]] marvel over the sight of the valuable, Buldeo informs the two that there's bound to be more treasure like the dagger, before leaving on horseback with Tabaqui who was waiting for him.\n\nSeveral days later, as the jungle boy is being educated and re-introduced to civilization by [[Katherine \"Kitty\" Brydon]] and [[Dr. Julius Plumford]], Buldeo and Tabaqui arrange for Boone and Wilkins to meet them at an outdoor tavern. There, they tell Boone and Wilkins the stories of the \"Lost City of Hanuman\" and how all who traveled there to claim treasure perished along the way and Tabaqui further backs up Buldeo's point by adding that entering the Black Jungle would be risking your life, unless one knew the way. Boone forms a partnership with Buldeo and the men plan to \"persuade\" Mowgli into assisting them.\n\nMowgli refuses and Kitty later calls off her engagement to Boone after his treatment of Mowgli. The following day, Buldeo and Tabaqui round up some [[Indian Bandits|bandits]] and track down Mowgli. They attempt to capture Mowgli so he can lead them to the treasure but fail as [[Baloo]] intervenes only to be shot and wounded by Boone and Wilkins.\n\n[[File:Anirudhagarwal.jpg|thumb|Tabaqui restrains Kitty while Boone addresses Mowgli.]]\n\nBoone's team as with the bandits then kidnap Kitty, knowing that Mowgli will do anything for her. In the process, her father; [[Colonel Geoffrey Brydon|Colonel Brydon]] is shot in the leg and inadvertently captured as well. Mowgli catches up with the group and is told by Boone that if he doesn't lead them to the lost city, \"unpleasantries may occur.\" To illustrate, Tabaqui threatens to cut Kitty's throat unless Mowgli obliges. Mowgli agrees to take them there, but promises they won\u2019t survive. \n\nThat night, after Mowgli silences a group of howling wolves to stop Wilkins complaining, Shere Khan's growl is heard. Tabaqui warns Boone that Shere Khan is nearby and is returning to the area. Boone initially hopes to hunt the tiger, but Buldeo firmly advises him not to.\n\nThe next morning, the group wake up to Harley shouting and alerting them of Mowgli's escape, but the soldier falls into quicksand and begins to sink. Wilkins poorly tries to rescue Harley, but by the time the rest of the group catches up, it's too late. Boone, however, is unaffected by Harley's death - stating that they shouldn't waste time over \"every little thing.\" Boone's lack of remorse shocks Wilkins, Buldeo, and Tabaqui but they oblige nonetheless. As the journey continues, Wilkins begins to stress and complain more and more much to Tabaqui's annoyance.\n\nLater on, Tabaqui (possibly suffering a nervous breakdown) splits off from the group and finds Mowgli who is atop some cliffs, surveying the group's journey. Despite his middle age and unhealthy appearance, Tabaqui proves to be a formidably strong and capable assailant; ferociously attacking the jungle boy. He tries to throw Mowgli off the edge, while the group watches from below, and when that plan fails, he beats Mowgli to the ground and brutally tries to finish him off with a boulder. But Mowgli kicks Tabaqui in the groin and he begins to lose balance under the weight of the boulder. Screaming hideously, Tabaqui falls from the cliff edge before being dashed and instantly killed on the rocks below.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original Jungle Book novel, Tabaqui was a Golden jackal who feeds on scraps from either Shere Khan or the wolves of the Seeonee Pack. In some adaptions, he is a hyena.\n*Tabaqui's death is quite ironic, because the boulder (which he had intended to kill Mowgli with) contributed to his defeat.\n*Tabaqui shares some similarities with the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] from ''[[Robin Hood]]''. They are both physically-imposing characters who are heartless, scheming and very clever and both put their lives at risk during attempts to kill the hero (Tabaqui lifting the heavy rock while standing near the edge of a cliff and the Sheriff fighting Robin in Prince John's burning bedroom).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nTabaqui.png\nTabaquischula.jpg|Tabaqui holding his knife to Kitty's throat\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui Attack.PNG|Tabaqui attacks Mowgli\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui and Mowgli's Climatic Brawl.PNG|Tabaqui fighting Mowgli \nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui Picks Up a Rock.PNG|Tabaqui grabbing a rock\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui Proceeding to Finish Off Mowgli.PNG|Tabaqui preparing to crush Mowgli\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui About To Squash Mowgli.PNG|Tabaqui about to squash Mowgli\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Mowgli Kicks Tabaqui.PNG|Tabaqui is kicked in the groin\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui's Last Moment.PNG|Tabaqui losing his balance as he struggles with the rock.\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui Falls.PNG|Tabaqui finally falls\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui Screaming.PNG|Tabaqui screaming as he plummets\nThe Jungle Book 1994 Widescreen Tabaqui's death.PNG|Tabaqui's death\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Guides]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]"
