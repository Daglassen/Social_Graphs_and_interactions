It is a giant machine that takes the form of a Salamander.\n\n==History==\nThe Divine Beast Vah Rudania was created 10,000 years ago by the [[Sheikah]], along with the other three Divine Beasts and [[Guardian (Breath of the Wild)|Guardian]]s, to combat [[Calamity Ganon]].<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Red|four Divine Beasts}} are the ancient Sheikah weapons wielded by the four Champions who Ganon defeated.|Impa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|The people thought it wise to utilize their technological prowess to ensure the safety of the land, should Calamity Ganon ever return. They constructed four mechanical wonders to be known as the Divine Beasts.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> Four [[Champion]]s were picked to pilot the Divine Beasts, who launched a full-scale attack on Ganon,<ref>{{Cite|The Divine Beasts were piloted by four individuals of exceptional skill from across the land. And thus, the plan to neutralize Ganon was formed.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> headed by a princess and a hero wielding the [[Master Sword]]. Their efforts were successful and Ganon was sealed away for a time.<ref>{{Cite|Upon Ganon's inevitable return to Hyrule, the princess and the hero fought alongside these four Champions against this ancient evil. The Guardians were tasked with protecting the hero as the Divine Beasts unleashed a furious attack upon their terrible foe. And when the hero wielding the sword that seals the darkness delivered his final blow... The princess used her sacred power to seal away Calamity Ganon.|Impa|BotW}}</ref>\n\n110 years before the present, the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]] was warned by a fortune teller of Ganon's return.<ref>{{Cite|Reports keep arriving regarding the excavation of relics. The fortune teller's predictions seem to be coming true. Calamity Ganon was not a figure of fable, or even of legend. He actually existed in our great land of Hyrule. We must investigate all the relics, learn as much as we can. But understanding the Divine Beasts alone will take time... Zelda's eyes lit up like a wildfire when I told her about the relics... I must admit, she has a knack for research.|King Rhoam's Journal|BotW}}</ref> The Divine Beasts were rediscovered after being excavated,<ref>{{Cite|But there was also...a prophecy. \"The signs of a resurrection of Calamity Ganon are clear. And the power to oppose it lies dormant beneath the ground.\" We decided to heed the prophecy and began excavating large areas of land. It wasn't long before we discovered several ancient relics made by the hands of our distant ancestors. These relics, the Divine Beasts, were giant machines piloted by warriors.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> and four Champions were chosen to pilot them in a repeated battle of the past \u2014 the [[Goron]] Champion [[Daruk]] was chosen to operate Rudania.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Red|Divine Beast Vah Rudania}}, controlled by {{Color|BotW Blue|Daruk}} of the Gorons.|Impa|BotW}}</ref> It was also during this time that Rudania served as the protector of the Goron tribe of [[Eldin (Region)|Eldin]].<ref>{{Cite|They say 100 years ago, it actually used to protect our people from harm... but that was then, and this is now!|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> However, despite Link's, Princess Zelda's, and the four Champions' best efforts and preparations, Ganon surprised them by corrupting and taking control of the Divine Beasts.<ref>{{Cite|The princess, her appointed knight, and the rest of the Champions were on the brink of sealing away Ganon... But nay... Ganon was cunning, and he responded with a plan beyond our imagining. He appeared from deep below Hyrule Castle, seized control of the Guardians and the Divine Beasts, and turned them against us.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> Daruk was killed by [[Fireblight Ganon]], a being created by Ganon to seize control of Rudania.<ref>{{Cite|Watch yourself now! That ugly pain in the crag is Ganon's handiwork. Thing got the best of me a hundred years ago.|Daruk|BotW}}</ref> The losing battle resulted in Link collapsing and taken to the [[Shrine of Resurrection]] to recover, while Zelda fended off Ganon alone for the next 100 years.\n\n100 years later, Ganon continues to hold influence over the Divine Beasts and Guardians.<ref>{{Cite|Somehow, Ganon has maintained control over all four Divine Beasts, as well as those Guardians swarming around Hyrule Castle.|King Rhoam|BotW}}</ref> Rudania now climbs along the rockface of [[Death Mountain]],<ref>{{Cite|Do ya see {{Color|BotW Blue|Rudania}} stompin' around up there on the mountain?|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> plaguing the Gorons below by causing its eruptions to worsen and launching [[Magma Bomb]]s.<ref>{{Cite|With {{Color|BotW Blue|Rudania}} runnin' wild recently, Death Mountain's eruptions have gotten real bad.|Bludo|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|We used to mine by {{Color|BotW Blue|the summit}}, but with that {{Color|BotW Blue|lizard monster}} launchin' those {{Color|BotW Blue|magma bombs}} at everything...|Bohrin|BotW}}</ref> Consequently, the Gorons' mining operations have declined as a result.<ref>{{Cite|Now all it does is mess up our mining operations! We're all suffering because it's stoppin' us from doin' business!|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> They have resorted to using [[Cannon]]s to drive away Rudania, but it always returns.<ref>{{Cite|I can't tell ya how many times we've used the {{Color|BotW Red|cannon}} to chase off that fiend.|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> While visiting Eldin on his quest to free the Divine Beasts from Ganon's influence, Link meets [[Bludo]], the Gorons' Boss, who is partly responsible for driving Rudania away. Bludo had planned to use the Cannon at Death Mountain on Rudania, but had sent his assistant, [[Yunobo]], to retrieve painkillers for his sore back. Link finds Yunobo at the [[Abandoned North Mine]]. However, even after delivering the painkillers, Bludo is still too sore to operate the Cannon and is forced to cancel. Link finds Yunobo again, but tells him that he wants to board Rudania.<ref>{{Cite|WHAT?! You're gonna try to board the Divine Beast? Who do you think you are...{{Color|BotW Blue|Lord Daruk}}? It's dangerous in there, goro! <small>Though I guess if you weakened it first, it might be possible...</small> But...why risk it?! [...] Hmm. Well, I don't really get it, but I'm sure you have your reasons, goro...|Yunobo|BotW}}</ref> The pair then decide to launch an assault on Rudania, using the Cannons stationed around Death Mountain and Yunobo as the cannonball, to weaken and disable it.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! It occurs to me that YOU know how to use the cannons! Don't you, goro? <small>Maybe we CAN get across after all...</small> So let's just do what I do to help {{Color|BotW Blue|Boss}} sometimes. That means I'm gonna be the cannonball! And you'll launch me, goro! [...] I've got {{Color|BotW Blue|Daruk's Protection}}, goro! My ancestor's help can't possibly fail me!|Yunobo|BotW}}</ref> Together they lower the [[Bridge of Eldin]] to reach the mountain, which Bludo had previously rose to prevent Rudania from crossing over.<ref>{{Cite|The problem is...good ol' Boss raised the {{Color|BotW Red|Bridge of Eldin}} to make sure that mean Divine Beast couldn't get over here.|Yunobo|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter Link disables and reaches Rudania, he eventually confronts Fireblight Ganon and defeats him, returning full control of the Divine Beast to Daruk's spirit. With Rudania under his control again, Daruk operates it to climb to [[Death Mountain Summit]] where it takes aim at Ganon toward [[Hyrule Castle]].<ref>{{Cite|I'm gonna take this down the mountain. I'll have a better shot at Ganon there. And then, once you've made your way into Hyrule Castle, we're gonna light that thing up!|Daruk|BotW}}</ref> Daruk later unleashes Rudania's attack when Link confronts Ganon in Hyrule Castle,<ref>{{Cite|Let's go, little guy! Now! Open up wide, Ganon!|Daruk|BotW}}</ref> inflicting 12.5% of damage upon him. When combined with the other freed Divine Beasts' attacks, the assault inflicts 50% of damage total.\n\n==Entrance to the Divine Beast==\n[[File:BotW Death Mountain Summit.png|thumb|right|200px|Divine Beast Vah Rudania inside Death Mountain]]\nAfter crossing the Bridge of Eldin, Link and Yunobo begin their scale to attack Rudania. However, it deploys [[Sentry|Sentries]] to hinder their progress, requiring that Link and Yunobo sneak by or destroy some of the Sentries to resume their scale.<ref>{{Cite|Oh... Yikes... A {{Color|BotW Blue|sentry}} is always a nuisance, no matter where it is or how many of them there are.|Yunobo|BotW}}</ref> Otherwise, if any of them are caught, Rudania will furiously unleash Magma Bombs at them.<ref>{{Cite|If one finds you, {{Color|BotW Blue|Rudania}} will go nuts, which will cause {{Color|BotW Blue|Death Mountain}} to erupt, goro. I...always get spotted, and then {{Color|BotW Blue|magma bombs}} come raining down one after another.|Yunobo|BotW}}</ref> The pair must travel to Death Mountain's three Cannons, using each them to fire at Rudania to weaken it. After using the third Cannon, Rudania falls into Death Mountain's crater, allowing Link to board it.\n\nOnce Link has entered it the first time, Rudania becomes a Travel Gate point which Link can return to at any time until he has completed the dungeon. Upon its completion, Link can no longer enter the interior of Rudania, and [[warping]] to it takes him to Death Mountain Summit instead.\n\n==Themes and Navigation==\n[[File:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania Icon.png|right]]\nAfter entering Rudania, Link activates a [[Guidance Stone]] and creates a Travel Gate to Rudania. Daruk then speaks to him in spirit, guiding him the way to another Guidance Stone that will give Link a [[Map]] of the Divine Beast.\n\nThe interior of Rudania is initially pitch dark inside. Inside its walls are numerous [[Malice|Glowing Eyeball]]s. Shooting their eyes will destroy them and make a [[Treasure Chest]] appear in their place. The interior of Rudania is split into three sections; in the first section, shooting the Glowing Eyeballs will drop Treasure Chests containing five [[Ice Arrow]]s, a [[Dragonbone Boko Club]], and a torch. In the second section, treasure chests containing a [[Knight's Bow]] and a set of ten arrows altogether can be found. To progress through these sections, Link must light a weapon with [[Blue Fire]] from a lantern in the first section and use it light the other lanterns to open grated doorways. In the third section, Link finds the Guidance Stone that will give him the Divine Beast's map.\n\nAfter receiving the map, Link is able to manipulate Rudania from the [[Sheikah Slate]]'s map. Pressing the purple dials will cause Rudania to change its position by flipping onto its side. Doing so will change the orientation of its interior and exterior and allow Link to reach areas he could not previously before. Receiving the map also opens the shutters on Rudania's back, bringing light into its interior. Daruk instructs Link that he must find and activate each of Rudania's five [[Terminal]]s to fully regain control of it.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Red|terminals}} that {{Color|BotW Red|control}} Rudania are noted by the glowing points on your map. To take back Rudania, you'll need to activate all of the {{Color|BotW Red|terminals}}.|Daruk|BotW}}</ref> Its Terminals are located in and on various places of its body.\n\nAfter activating all of the Terminals, Link is directed by Daruk to Rudania's Main Control Unit, which is situated on its backside.<ref>{{Cite|Nice! That was the last {{Color|BotW Red|terminal}}! Now go ahead and start up the {{Color|BotW Red|main control unit}}!|Daruk|BotW}}</ref> As Link approaches it, he is suddenly engaged by Fireblight Ganon and forced into a battle. After defeating Fireblight Ganon, a [[Heart Container]] drops and full control of Rudania is regained. Daruk then appears to Link as a spirit and grants him [[Daruk's Protection]] in gratitude.<ref>{{Cite|I wanna give you something. It's a special power of mine called Daruk's Protection. It's no good to me now that I'm a spirit... but it might be useful for you.|Daruk|BotW}}</ref>\n\n===Minor Enemies and Traps===\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Cursed Bokoblin Model.png|[[Cursed Bokoblin]]\nFile:BotW Cursed Lizalfos Model.png|[[Cursed Lizalfos]]\nFile:BotW Cursed Moblin Model.png|[[Cursed Moblin]]\nFile:BotW Glowing Eyeball Model.png|[[Glowing Eyeball]]\nFile:BotW Guardian Scout I Model.png|[[Guardian Scout I]]\nFile:BotW Malice Model.png|[[Malice]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nDivine Beast Vah Rudania is named after [[Darunia]], the Sage of Fire from {{OoT}}.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania 2.png|The Divine Beast Vah Rudania atop Death Mountain\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania Caldera.png|Divine Beast Vah Rudania nestled in Death Mountain's caldera\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania Interior.png|The interior of Divine Beast Vah Rudania\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania Map Side.png|The [[Sheikah Slate]]'s [[Sheikah Slate#Map|Map]] of Divine Beast Vah Rudania, as seen from the side\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania Map Top.png|The Sheikah Slate's Map of Divine Beast Vah Rudania, as seen from the top\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania Stationed.png|Divine Beast Vah Rudania stationed at Death Mountain Summit\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Rudania Firing.png|Divine Beast Vah Rudania firing upon Hyrule Castle\nFile:HWAoC Divine Beast Vah Rudania Render.png|Render of Divine Beast Vah Rudania from ''Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{DungeonNav2|BotW}}\n{{Categories\n |Death Mountain, Divine Beasts\n |dungeons= BotW\n |objects= BotW, HWAoC\n}}"
