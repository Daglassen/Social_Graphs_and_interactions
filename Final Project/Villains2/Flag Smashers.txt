They believe the world was better during the extermination of half of the universe's population, and hate the state of the world after the other half of the universe's population was brought back to life. They are led by [[Karli Morgenthau]].\n\nDespite being villains, they commit somewhat noble acts like giving medicine to the poor and needy, and shutting down the operations of corrupt corporate executives. They act as enemies of [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]] and [[Bucky Barnes]].\n{{Stub}}\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:The Falcon and The Winter Soldier characters]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
