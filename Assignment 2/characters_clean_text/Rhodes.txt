Rhodes is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Rhodes is a man who tends to the windmills with his loving wife, Ralera. They take shifts with Rhodes being awake at night, while his wife takes over during the day.
He is a friendly man who will speak to Link if he wishes. Link can ask him about what he is doing, and Rhodes will describe his job for him. In response, Rhodes will return the question. Link can reply a few different ways: saying he is lost, that he is a thief, or that he is a traveler. Should he say that he is lost, Rhodes will laugh and say that everyone is lost to some extent.  However, he then points him to the Ton Pu Inn so Link can have somewhere to stay the night. Rhodes will refer to him as the "lost boy" afterward. If Link says he is a thief, Rhodes takes it as a game. He will tease Link about it when spoken to again. When Link admits that he is a traveler, Rhodes is fairly uninterested as he does not consider the hero a threat.
At 9 o'clock in the evening, he heads out to the tree for his round of watching the windmills. Once 5 o'clock in the morning rolls around, Rhodes goes home to rest.
