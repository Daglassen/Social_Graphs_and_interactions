Reede is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Reede is the head of Hateno Village and can usually be found tending to the fields behind his home. When Link first approaches him, Reede notes that he must be an adventurer and introduces himself, asking Link what he thinks of the village. If Link agrees that it is peaceful, Reede says they are recovering from the Great Calamity at last. Link can admit that he is uncomfortable in Hateno and Reede will laugh, claiming that the village has grown. He ends the conversation by inviting the hero to stay for as long as he chooses.
Link can return to Reede and ask him about a number of subjects. Asking about the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab leads him to direct Link to the hill where it sits. Reede mentions that a Sheikah tribe member conducts research there and never comes out. He also expresses concern over the occupants' wellbeing.
Link can ask about the Calamity itself and Reede will describe the torturous event, noting that even now it is difficult to speak of. He advises Link to speak to the elders of the village to learn more about it, as Reede himself was not alive.
Asking him about Hateno Village itself allows Reede to explain that the settlement was rebuilt, having only just survived the ruin of the Great Calamity. He mentions that many people now inhabit the village and they see a few travelers every-so-often.
The sign in front of his house has the word "Mayor" written on it in Hylian.[citation needed]
