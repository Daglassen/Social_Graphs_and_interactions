He appears in ''[[Dave the Barbarian]]''.\n\n==Background==\nHe has \"mommy issues\" and carries a security blanket known as his \"ni-ni lankie\". He often experiences short-term memory loss and\u00a0attention deficit disorder. He was trapped in a coffin for thousands of years. In the present, Dave plays on the bagpipe-like instrument 'The Garglepipes', unknowingly causing the coffin to break and freed Quosmir from his prison.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nHe has immense magical powers including flight, superhuman strength, super-speed, and flaming loogies.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nvlcsnap-2016-07-05-19h14m49s574.png\nvlcsnap-2016-07-05-19h15m07s147.png\nvlcsnap-2016-07-05-19h15m11s478.png\nDave the Barbarian 120a Red Sweater Of Courage Docslax 438313.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 120a Red Sweater Of Courage Docslax 554471.jpg\nvlcsnap-2016-07-16-21h17m38s730.png\nvlcsnap-2016-07-16-21h17m50s690.png\nvlcsnap-2016-07-16-21h17m59s247.png\nvlcsnap-2016-07-19-21h13m46s607.png\nvlcsnap-2016-07-19-21h24m57s471.png\nvlcsnap-2016-07-30-20h39m00s188.png|Ooh, Shiny, Shiny\nDave the Barbarian 1x10 Pipe Down_214667.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x10 Pipe Down_217233.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x10 Pipe Down_279267.jpg\nDave the Barbarian 1x10 Pipe Down_288067.jpg\nQuozmir (8).png\nQuozmir (7).png\nQuozmir (6).png\nQuozmir (5).png\nQuozmir (4).png\nQuozmir (3).png\nQuozmir (2).png\nQuozmir (1).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Dave the Barbarian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Dave the Barbarian characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
