However, when the ex-Supreme Commander reforms after the election between him and [[Toaster]] for title of Supreme Commander, he reveals himself to be the [[Hearing Aid]]'s long-lost twin brother. After their reunion, the ex-Supreme Commander travels back to Earth with [[Tinselina]], Toaster, and the others, but their launch is halted when Toaster and the ex-Supreme Commander have to jump off to stop the Missile from destroying Earth, as the ex-Supreme Commander forgot to deactivate the rocket and is the only one who knows the abort\u00a0code. The ex-Supreme Commander succeeds in deactivating the Missile in the nick of time, and the rocket collapses. He and Toaster are then rescued by the others.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although the Missile is depicted with a mouth, he never speaks. It is unknown if he was meant to be anthropomorphized, like the other machines in the movie.\n\n{{The Brave Little Toaster}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Missile, The}}\n[[Category:The Brave Little Toaster characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
