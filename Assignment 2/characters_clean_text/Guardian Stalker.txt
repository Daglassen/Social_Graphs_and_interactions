Guardian Stalkers are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==


=== Breath of the Wild ===

Guardian Stalkers are a type of Guardian found throughout Hyrule, most commonly in the area surrounding Hyrule Castle. They were built by the ancient Sheikah to be used as a powerful weapon against Calamity Ganon. During the events of Breath of the Wild, they are an enemy to Link under Calamity Ganon's influence. Guardian Stalkers have 1500 health and can fire powerful blue laser beams from their eye that can deal up to 58 points of damage. If a target is too close to them, they will attempt to distance themselves in order to fire their lasers; otherwise, they will relentlessly pursue the target until they lose track of it. Sometimes when firing their lasers, they will fire in rapid succession if their health is low enough and Link has not moved too far from when they fired their last laser. These rapid lasers will stop if Link gets hit too far from their last firing point, if Link is no longer within their range, or at a random stopping point.
Link can inflict 500 damage to Guardian Stalkers by deflecting their lasers back at their eye with a Perfect Guard. When defeated, they may drop any combination of Ancient Materials. Link can cut off the legs of a Guardian Stalker, which temporarily stuns them and results in Ancient Materials being dropped. This can also topple them, rendering them helpless. However, a disarmed Guardian Stalker will attempt to recover its footing and distance itself from Link while attacking, making it difficult to land further hits. If Link hits a Guardian Stalker in it's eye using a bow, it will temporarily stun it in a similar fashion that cutting off it's legs would do. Sometimes when doing this, the Guardian Stalker may move sideways in order to mess up Link's aim. Using Stasis + on a charging up Guardian Stalker will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during stasis.
In Master Mode, Guardian Stalkers will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge up phase before firing their laser to throw off Link's timing.
