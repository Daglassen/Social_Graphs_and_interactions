He appears in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episode \"[[The Final Review]]\".\n\n==Role in the series==\n[[Bonkers D. Bobcat]] had admired him and his show for a time. But T.J. was not pleased about his show taken off the air due to numerous bad reviews from the TV critic Charles Quibble.\n\nT.J. captured Quibble and held him hostage in the TV studio. Quibble said that someone had to get bad reviews so that his own show could get good reviews (it was what the audience wanted). T.J. built a device called the \"Critically Correct\" Machine, which would crush Quibble with an anvil if he made too many critical remarks.\n\nDetective Piquel faced T.J. one on one. When Finger charged at Piquel, the detective stepped to one side, and T.J. ended up getting his finger caught in the coin slot of a cola machine.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the second Disney character to wear a green zoot suit, the first being [[Greasy]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', the third being [[The Green-Eyed Monster of Jealousy|the Green-Eyed Monster of Jealousy]] from ''[[Quack Pack]]''.\n*The name T. J. Finger is a parody of the popular TV show ''T.J. Hooker''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nvlcsnap-2015-08-07-11h17m53s406.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-07-11h18m13s337.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-07-11h18m54s499.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-07-11h21m20s070.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-07-11h21m46s719.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-07-11h21m52s458.png|Caught in the act\nvlcsnap-2015-08-07-11h22m32s544.png|\"I thought hanging around with the cops would keep me from being a suspect.
