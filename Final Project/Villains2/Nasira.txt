She is [[Jafar]]'s fraternal twin sister.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nNasira's vengeful, ambitious, haughty,\u00a0optimistic, impulsive, and a little cocky at times. Nasira's also said to be 'just as nasty and power-hungry' as Jafar. Though Nasira is a great strategist, her arrogance does get in the way of things, and it ultimately led to her downfall.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nNasira's a middle-aged sorceress/necromancer of Arab descent. Her long black hair resembles a cobra's hood and her sharp eyes are dark brown (they appear black from a distance). Nasira's very tall (a head taller than Aladdin) and skinny. She usually wears a form-fitting, floor-length burgundy dress with black accents. Wrapped around her right bicep is a golden four-ringed snake armband.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nNasira is presented as a naturally-talented sorceress, unlike her brother who required [[Genie]]'s magic to become capable of such feats. She can hurl mystical bolts, perform resurrections through magical artifacts, summon zombies and skeletons, bend others to her will, change her appearance, bring objects to life, create portals, and paralyze enemies.\n\n==Video games==\n===''Nasira's Revenge''===\nIn the opening cutscene, Nasira summoned her [[Jafar|brother's]] ghost from the 'darkest depths' (probably a euphemism for hell). She discovered a way to bring Jafar back from the dead. Nasira was optimistic, but Jafar was\u00a0wary. He warned Nasira not to underestimate [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] or his 'infernal' [[genie]] as he did before. Nasira insisted she had everything under control.\n\nNasira hypnotized the guards, including [[Razoul]], and used them to arrest [[Jasmine]] and [[Sultan]]. She then ordered the guards to bring Aladdin to her, dead or alive. The following morning, Genie found a wanted poster and showed it to Aladdin. Aladdin realized something must have happened to Princess Jasmine and the Sultan, so he set off for the palace.\n\nAladdin barged into the throne room and confronted Nasira, demanding to know what she'd done with Princess Jasmine and Sultan. Nasira nonchalantly revealed she'd disposed of them and then\u00a0angrily\u00a0proclaimed once Jafar returned, Aladdin won't be around either. Before Aladdin could respond, Genie (rather bluntly) told Nasira Jafar wasn't coming back. Nasira lured Genie into a false sense of security before banishing him to the Cave of Wonders. She then ordered the guards to throw Aladdin in the dungeon and stated she'll be there to deal with him personally. But\u00a0[[Iago]] and [[Abu]] rescued Aladdin and helped him escape the dungeon. Aladdin found Nasira and charged at her. Nasira blasted Aladdin and ran away, leaving him to a brainwashed Razoul. Aladdin defeated Razoul and somehow freed him from the spell. Razoul begrudgingly thanked Aladdin and said street rat continued his way.\n\nAladdin went to the Oasis and found the mystic he was apparently looking for (this was never explained). She told him Genie was imprisoned in the Cave of Wonders. So Aladdin went to the Cave of Wonders and rescued Genie. Aladdin and co. escaped and ran into the same mystic who helped him before. She told Aladdin Jasmine was imprisoned in pyramids. Aladdin thanked the mystic and basically said he owed her one. Once Aladdin and co. continued their way, the mystic revealed herself to be Nasira. While holding one of the artifacts needed to resurrect her brother, Nasira stated she was using Aladdin to collect the artifacts for her.\n\nAfter Aladdin saved Jasmine from Anubis, the princess attempted to warn him about Nasira. Aladdin arrogantly brushed off the warning, claiming it hadn't worked yet and continued his way. Aladdin rescued Jasmine's father and Nasira (disguised as the mystic) appeared. Aladdin asked her how she kept finding him and Nasira ditched her disguise. Furious, Aladdin attempted to kill her, but Nasira paralyzed him and ran off with the artifacts. Once the spell wore off, Aladdin followed Nasira and confronted her. He smashed the artifacts, killed Jafar, and chased Nasira off (the player can also choose to knock her out by throwing four or five crystals at her). Either way, Nasira escaped on a floating platform and it is assumed she survived.\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Nasira\" means \"helper\" in Arabic.\n*In the original tale of Aladdin, the evil magician (whom Jafar was based on) has a younger brother who wishes to exact revenge on Aladdin. The younger brother goes to visit a holy woman famous for her healing abilities and wisdom, Fatima, and then murders her. Assuming her identity, he goes to the palace to meet the princess\u00a0and tricks her by \"preaching\"\u00a0that if a roc's egg is hanged from the middle of the dome, it will become the wonder of the world. The magician's brother intends for Aladdin to wish his genie for a roc's egg and then have it hanged. Unbeknownst to everyone, any genie will destroy ''anyone ''who wishes for such thing since rocs and even their unhatched chicks are masters of all genies. The princess then thought only of the roc's egg. When Aladdin is told by the princess of her desire, he summons the genie and makes the wish. The genie becomes immensely outraged by such wish. Before he disappears, he reveals the fake Fatima's true identity. Aladdin summons\u00a0the impostor\u00a0and once he arrives still in his disguise, Aladdin swiftly kills him. The original tale of Aladdin ends there. Nasira is most likely based on that character.\n*It is unknown whether Nasira knew that Iago was the one who truly killed Jafar, as he was the one who betrayed and destroyed his former ally by destroying his lamp in ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' because it is never shown if she has a grudge against him as well as Aladdin and Genie, but she may have heard about it from her brother.\n*Despite her overall high standing as the sibling of a Disney villain as well as a natural sorceress, Nasira is never mentioned outside of the video game she debuts in.\n*Interestingly, the snake band on Nasira's arm matches the one Jasmine wore on her arm when she was wearing the red slave outfit in the first movie.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nmeeting.png|Nasira summons Jafar's ghost to tell him her plan\nNasira throne.png|Nasira and Aladdin meet for the first time.
