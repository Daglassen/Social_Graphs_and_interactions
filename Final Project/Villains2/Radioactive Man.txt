When the Radioactive Man fought [[Iron Man]], [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], and [[Black Panther]]\u00a0inside the [[Stark Tower]], he nearly bested them all until when he tried to absorb the Arc Reactor's power, and was defeated by the trio.\n\nHe was taken to the Negative Zone and helps out during Assault On 42 when [[Annihilus]] attacks the prison. He was seemingly killed by the annihilation wave.\n\n===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===\nIgor Stancheck/Radioactive Man appears in ''Avengers Assemble. ''At some point, Radioactive Man was apprehended by [[HYDRA]] and placed in a radiation-proof capsule in order to be used as a power source. [[Crimson Dynamo]] had obtained the key to the capsule so that [[Winter Guard]] could free them. When the destabilized Russian facility threatened a nearby village and the [[Avengers]] worked with the Winter Guard to save the village, Crimson Dynamo and [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]] freed Radioactive Man who then dissolves the facility.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nRadioactive Man possesses the power to absorb almost any kind of radiation from the environment around him and store it in his body's cellular structure. If needed he can release the stored radiation in blasts of heat, force, or pure radioactivity from his hands.\n\nHe can absorb and expel radiation across the spectrum, from heat blasts to high-intensity bursts that can rob objects of their inertia (stopping Thor's hammer in mid-flight). He is super-strong, and highly resistant to damage.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nRadioactive Man AEMH 1.png\nRadioactive Man AEMH 2.png\nRadioactive Man AEMH.png\ntumblr_me1hairijP1rhgiwro1_1280.png\nWinter Guard AA.png\nWinter Guard AA 1.png\nRadioactive Man &amp; Darkstar  AA.png\nRadioactive Man AA 1.png\nRadioactive Man AA 2.png\nRadioactive Man AA 3.png\nRadioactive Man AA.png\nRadioactive_Man.png\nRadioactive Man (Hulk vs the World).png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\nThere is a superhero on the Fox animated sitcom\u00a0''The Simpsons\u00a0''that is also called [http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Radioactive_Man_(character) Radioactive Man] .
