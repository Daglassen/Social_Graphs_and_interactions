She appears in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[The Good Muddahs]]\" together with her sisters \"[[Boom-Boom Beagle]]\" [382-238] and \"[[Babydoll Beagle]]\" [776-177].\n\nHer large hairdo is one of her defining characteristics, and she uses it often to smuggle objects in and out of places undetected.\u00a0\n\n==Personality==\nBouffant is the leader of the Beagle Babes and seems to be the smartest and most mature of the trio. She comes up with most of their plans and takes care of her younger sisters (like going shoplifting for food that they want). While the Beagle Babes are thieves, they don't seem to be very evil in nature. Bouffant and her sisters really started to care about [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] after they kidnap her.\n\n==Appearances==\nBouffant Beagle and her sisters [[Boom-Boom Beagle]] and [[Babydoll Beagle]] appear in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[The Good Muddahs]]\", where she and her sisters kidnap [[Webby]] and hold her for ransom.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" navigation=\"true\">\nTheBeagleBabes.jpg\n180424.jpg\n136784252131.jpg\nBouffant beagle.jpg|link=Bouffant Beagle\nBeagleBabes TGM2.png\nBeagleBabes TGM.png\nBouffant_TGM3.png|Bouffant listening to Webby's story.\nBBabes 3.png\nBeagleBabes TGM4.png|The Beagle Babes crying.\nBouffant_TGM4.png\nBBabes 5.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beagle, Bouffant}}\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
