Estan is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Estan is a Gerudo who manages a General Store in Gerudo Town. She sells a variety of cooked meat.
According to Maike, a merchant at the Kara Kara Bazaar, Estan is her little sister. Maike tells Link that Estan knows Hylian well, recommending that he stop by and meet her.
When Link speaks to Estan, she greets him and asks him what he eats for breakfast, lunch or dinner depending on the time. If Link says that he eats meat, Estan comments that he has good taste. If Link says that he eats vegetables, she insists that he must have meant meat. Estan wonders if Frita, the Rito girl who stands near her Shop, has something against meat and mutters that it is impossible.
After Divine Beast Vah Naboris has been calmed, Estan is very grateful and thanks Link.
Estan tells Link that she once traversed across Hyrule Kingdom in search for the best meats and learned common words in the Hylian language during her travels. Although Estan knows some words in the Hylian Language, she usually mispronounces them, such as saying "tank you" instead of "thank you."
Not only does Estan sell her wares, she'll also buy Items from Link. When she accidentally says "sarqso" instead of thank you, she appears disappointed. She's very grateful for his patronage.
When Link buys Estan's meats, she calls it a good purchase. If Link has bought all of her wares, she thanks him.
