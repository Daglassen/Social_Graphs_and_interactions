Krane is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Krane is a Goron who stands watch at the western entrance to Goron City. When Krane first meets with Link, he recognizes him as the long lost Hylian Champion, but then admits that Goron City has seen so few tourists lately that he now passes the time pretending to greet the Champion. He asks what brings him to Goron City, to which Link can either answer that he is there for a Divine Beast, pleasure, or on business. Krane will give him different information based on how he responds. If Link speaks to him again and answers that he is visiting for a different reason, Krane will notice the change and become confused.
When told that Link is there for a Divine Beast, Krane will mishear him, but adds that Bludo has been driving away a lizard monster, referring to the Divine Beast Vah Rudania. When told that he is there for pleasure, Krane remarks that Goron City has grown much too hot and recommends that Link buys a Flamebreaker Set piece or a Fireproof Elixir. When told that he is on business, Krane comments that Goron City makes a lot of money selling Gems. He remarks that Gems make for terrible food to the Gorons and does not understand why other people would be interested in them.
