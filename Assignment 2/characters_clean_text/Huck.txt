Huck is member of the Rito tribe in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Huck can first be found talking with Verla about Divine Beast Vah Medoh outside The Slippery Falcon in Rito Village. He tells Link that Revali, the Champion of the Rito, once tamed Vah Medoh and used it to protect Rito Village. He continues, saying that all males from the Rito tribe are encouraged to be formidable warriors like Revali, though he considers this expectation is nearly impossible.
Huck can later be found outside of Rito Village's Armor Shop, the Brazen Beak, advertising the products inside. He advises Link to purchase the Snowquill Set if he wishes to head to the Hebra Mountains or go to any elevation higher than Rito Village. When asked about the Brazen Beak, he pitches their gear, which is made from Rito plumage. He quickly adds that the feathers used in the Armor aren't simply taken from Ritos and glued to shirts, rather they are crafted from the soft, molted feathers from baby Ritos as they mature.
