Magda planted a maze of flowers surrounding the [[Hila Rao Shrine]],<ref>{{Cite|Look! Aren't they lovely? I wanted to see how the shrine would look with flowers around it, and it's wonderful! Please, feel free to take a closer look. Just don't step on them!|Magda|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I planted flowers around the shrine. Please be careful where you step. You don't want to hurt them, do you?|Magda|BotW}}</ref> where she regularly tends to them. Because of her investment in her garden, she becomes upset if people step on or harm the flowers.<ref>{{Cite|Please take some time to really admire the flowers. I worked so hard to plant them...|Magda|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You're not stepping on my flowers, are you?!|Magda|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Magda or disrupts the flowers, she will either tell him about her flower patch or reprimand him, initiating the \"[[Watch Out for the Flowers]]\" [[Shrine Quest]].<ref>{{Cite|No! {{Color|BotW Red|You must not hurt the flowers}}! They are screaming out in pain!|Magda|BotW}}</ref> If Link disrupts the flowers a second time, she will yell at him and tell him to treat the flowers carefully.<ref>{{Cite|How many times do I have to say it?! {{Color|BotW Red|Please treat the flowers with care}}! They're living things, you know!|Magda|BotW}}</ref> If he does so a third time, Magda will break down and frantically run around her flower patch.<ref>{{Cite|So many times...|Magda|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I've lost count of how many times I've told you... It's just so many now...|Magda|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|How do you not understand? Why don't you get it?|Magda|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Big|ARGGG!! NOOOOOOO!!}}|Magda|BotW}}</ref> While running through her garden, she will rant at Link about his trespasses before falling on her face.<ref>{{Cite|I worked day...after day...after day...to plant those flowers. Then you come and hurt them...over...and over...|Magda|BotW}}</ref> She then resolves to make Link understand the \"flowers' rage\" before attacking him.<ref>{{Cite|I will make you understand...|Magda|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Big|the flowers' rage!!!}}|Magda|BotW}}</ref>\n\nWhen Magda attacks Link, she will remove three [[Heart]]s from his [[Life Gauge]]. If Link has less than three Hearts when she attacks, she will not cause any damage to him, instead knocking him out. Link can repeat this process indefinitely.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Names\n|align= left\n|enBr= \n|enBrM= \n|ja= {{Romanize|\u30aa\u30b3\u30d0|Okoba}}\n|jaM= \n|zhS= \n|zhSM= \n|zhT= \n|zhTM= \n|nl= \n|nlM= \n|fi= \n|fiM= \n|frC= \n|frCM= \n|frF= \n|frFM= \n|de= \n|deM= \n|hu= \n|huM= \n|it= \n|itM= \n|ko= \n|koM= \n|no= \n|noM= \n|pl= \n|plM= \n|ptB= \n|ptBM= \n|ptP= \n|ptPM= \n|ru= \n|ruM= \n|esS= \n|esSM= \n|esL= \n|esLM= }}\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Floret Sandbar]]\n* [[Hila Rao Shrine]]\n* [[Watch Out for the Flowers]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n{{Categories\n |Hylians\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
