[Who are you?] I'm a carpenter for {{Color|BotW Blue|Bolson Construction}}. Name's Hudson.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> a company situated in [[Hateno Village]] in [[East Necluda]]. He can initially be found attempting to demolish [[Link's House]] under [[Bolson]]'s orders.<ref name=\"Yeah\">{{Cite|Hey. [What are you doing?] I'm knocking this place down. [Why?] 'Cause no one is living here. [Why?] The owner of this house took off. [Why?] Don't know. Maybe skipped town without paying the bills? [Oh.] Answered all your questions? [Yes.] Good. A lot has happened since the {{Color|BotW Blue|Great Calamity}}. Tough to keep track of it all. [Right.] For the first time since then, we're finally getting back on our feet. [Good.] So best of luck to both of us. [Yeah.] Yeah.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> If [[Link]] offers to buy the house, Hudson will tell him to ask Bolson instead.<ref>{{Cite|[I'll buy this place!] Can't help you. Ask the {{Color|BotW Blue|boss}}.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> If Link agrees to purchase the house from Bolson, Hudson will take a break underneath a tree nearby. There, he mentions that Link would be a great hire for Bolson Construction, but retracts the offer upon learning that Link's name does not end in \"-son.\"<ref>{{Cite|[What are you doing?] Taking a break. By the way... [What?] Are you gonna buy that house? [Yeah.] You're pretty studly, aren't you? [Uh...come again?] You'd be a great hire for our company... What's your name? [I'm Link.] Oh... Well, too bad. Can't hire you. [Why?] 'Cause your name doesn't end in \"{{Color|BotW Red|son}}.\" [Son?] The boss, Bolson, has a strict hiring rule: {{Color|BotW Red|need a name ending in \"son}}.{{Color|BotW Red|\"}} No exceptions. [That's too bad.] \"Builds team unity,\" he says. Anyway... You got some stuff to do, right? Should get going, then.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAfter Link speaks to Bolson and initiates the [[Side Quest]] \"[[Hylian Homeowner]]\", Hudson is tasked with the responsibility of leading the Bolson Construction expansion project in [[Akkala]]. Before he leaves, he waits for Link to say goodbye.<ref>{{Cite|Yeah? [What are you doing?] Taking a break. By the way... Did you buy that house? [Yes.] Impressive. You're just a pup. [Uh...come again?] Don't worry about it. Anyway... [What?] Looks like I've gotta head out and leave this place soon. [Why?] I've been transferred. [Transferred...] Mighta heard, but Bolson Construction is planning to expand big-time. [That's great!] Yeah, big expansion.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> He then tells Link that he is going to Akkala, far north of [[Lanayru (Region)|Lanayru]] and welcomes Link to visit.<ref>{{Cite|[Where will you go?] Zora's Domain is north of here. We're going north of that, though. An area called the {{Color|BotW Blue|Akkala region}}. [That's pretty far.] Yeah...well. [Good luck!] OK then. Well... No time like the present, right? I should be getting on my way... If you'd like, you should come to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Akkala region}} and say hello. Well... Take care of yourself.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> This begins the Side Quest \"[[From the Ground Up]]\", tasking Link with the responsibility of visiting and assisting Hudson at [[Tarrey Town]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*For some reason, conversations with Hudson are usually composed of simple sentences and single-word responses.<ref>{{Cite|[That sounds tough.] That's right. It's tough.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> Hudson himself speaks very directly with practically everything he intends to say being expressed in a single sentence.<ref name=\"Yeah\"/>\n*Hudson has unique dialogue for the occasion that Link does not wear a [[Armor|shirt]], simply saying \"Oh.\" in response.<ref>{{Cite|Oh.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Hudson Concept Artwork.png|Concept artwork of {{Term|BotW|Hudson}}\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Carpenter]]\n* [[From the Ground Up]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hylians, Hyruleans\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
