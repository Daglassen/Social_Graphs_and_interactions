He is a recurring\u00a0antagonist\u00a0in\u00a0''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' also he appears in graffiti art on the [[Ghost (starship)|Ghost]] in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''===\nCad Bane first appears in the season one finale \"Hostage Crisis\", where he infiltrates the Senate building on\u00a0[[Coruscant]]\u00a0alongside a team of fellow bounty hunters. There he holds a group of senators hostage, and demands that Ziro the Hutt be released in exchange for their lives.\n\nIn the second season, Cad Bane is contacted by\u00a0[[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]]\u00a0for a special assignment: the capture of a [[Holocron]] from inside the [[Jedi Temple]]. Bane finds himself in a massive struggle for the stolen Holocron as [[Anakin Skywalker|Skywalker]] and\u00a0[[Ahsoka Tano]]\u00a0attempt to take it back. After he successfully delivers the Holocron to Sidious he was quickly assigned by the dark lord in order to kidnap force sensitive children and bring them to [[starwars:Mustafar|Mustafar]]. He is briefly captured before leading\u00a0[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Mace Windu]]\u00a0into a trap in his headquarters, allowing him to escape. When the Jedi asked him who he works for Bane responded by saying \u201cI work alone.\u201d which means you can\u2019t make me tell you who I work for. However Windu contemplates that Bane\u2019s fear of his client is stronger than his fear of the Jedi.\n\nIn the third season further details are revealed about Bane's attack on the senate building. The episode \"Evil Plans\" takes place before the events of the season one finale, and depicts Bane capturing the two droids [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] who involuntarily give him the plans to the Senate building. Then in the following episode \"Hunt for Ziro\", which takes place after \"Hostage Crisis\", it is revealed that he was hired to extract Ziro from custody by\u00a0[[Jabba the Hutt]], due to an incriminating datapad the latter possessed. Shortly after Bane is congratulated by Jabba for his success, Ziro escapes and the bounty hunter is hired to track down and capture the rogue\u00a0Hutt. He is eventually able to locate his target on the planet Teth but upon arrival he finds Ziro dead and the datapad missing. A short altercation between two Jedi who were also searching for the Hutt ensues but Bane is able to escape nonetheless.\n\nDuring the fourth season, Cad Bane is revealed to be in a Republic prison. He is then hired by fellow convict Moralo Eval for a job by\u00a0[[Count Dooku]]\u00a0to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine on [[Naboo]]. However, Kenobi poses as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen and manages to foil the plot even though Dooku escapes while Bane was arrested (supposedly for good this time).\n\n===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===\nHe appears in the episode \"[[Fighter Flight]]\" in Graffiti art on the [[Ghost (starship)|Ghost]] along with other Bounty Hunter Embo.\n\n=== ''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch]]'' ===\nAt the beginning of the Imperial era, Cad Bane is hired by Kaminoan prime minister Lama Su to recover the young girl, [[Omega]], a particular unaltered clone. Arriving on [[Bracca]], he single-handedly slaughters several clone troopers before confronting Omega and the clone deserter [[Hunter (Star Wars)|Hunter]]. At a dead end, the two opponents take out their blasters but Bane shoots faster, injuring Hunter. Omega tries to resist only for Bane to knock her down with a paralyzing beam and then takes her away.\n\nEscaping from Bracca, Bane greets the captured Omega in a cell aboard his ship. When Omega is persistent the Bad Batch will rescue her, Bane claims that her friends are long gone and that nobody is coming, warning her to sit tight and not cause any trouble. Bane then contacts Lama Su and informs he managed to capture Omega where he is then ordered to keep the girl alive and meet his Kaminoan advisor, Taun We on the planet Bora Vio to receive his credits.\n\nUpon arriving at his destination, Bane discovers Omega had managed to escape from her cell after tricking his droid, Todo 360 into allowing her to repair his leg. However, Bane is able locate and recapture Omega where he threatens the girl that she's lucky that his employers want her alive. Bane is then greeted by bounty hunter [[Fennec Shand]] who had killed Taun We, resulting in the two bounty hunters engaging in a duel. During the skirmish, Omega is able to escape where she is then rescued by Hunter and the rest of Clone Force 99. Bane tries to pursue them, only to discover that Shand had managed to sabotage his ship, leaving him stranded on the planet, much to his fury.\n\n== Printed media\u00a0==\nHe appears in the five-part\u00a0Marvel Comics\u00a0comic book miniseries\u00a0''Star Wars: Darth Maul'', set before the events of the prequel trilogy, where he aides [[Darth Maul]]\u00a0in kidnapping a Jedi Padawan.\n\n==Video Games==\n=== ''[[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition|Disney Infinity: 3.0]]'' ===\nHe appears after the\u00a0[[General Grievous]] fight on\u00a0[[Geonosis]]\u00a0and appears after you take TD-54 to the\u00a0Jedi Council\u00a0he steals TD-54 and you must chase him through the sky and then through the city of\u00a0Coruscant\u00a0he escapes but leaves TD-54 Behind.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nSidious_hiring_Bane.png\nBane_tortures_Ropal.png\nCad-Bane.jpg\nCad Bane holocron.jpg\nBaneTodoHELIOS-3E.png\nCad Bane in control.jpg\nBaneKenobi-Showdown.jpg\nMyHero-TB.png\nCadBane-SWSB.jpg\nCad_Bane.jpg\nCadBane_img_2.jpg\nCad_Bane_cover.png\nCad Bade Holocron FF.png\nCad-Bane-clonetrooper-SWCT.png\nFighter_Flight_Easter_Egg.jpg\n75024_cad_bane.png|[[LEGO]] Cad Bane minifigure\nSeries5_banner.jpg\nCad Bane Racer.jpg\nCad Bane Racer Car.jpg\nCad_bane.png|Cad Bane in ''Disney Infinity 3.0''\nCad Bane DI3.jpg\ntotr_bane.jpg\nCad Bane POP.png|Pop Figurine \n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cad Bane had possibly met [[Sabine Wren]] before due to her graffiti artwork being of himself and Embo in the episode \"[[Fighter Flight]]\".\n*Cad Bane was designed from unused concept art of a bounty hunter developed for ''A New Hope''.\n*According to [[Dave Filoni]], supervising director for ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', Bane's iconic toothpick was originally intended to be a cigarette, but the idea was dropped due to its negative and commercial-like message.\n*The whole point of Cad Bane\u2019s design is that he wouldn\u2019t be mistaken for any other character.\n*Before the cancellation of\u00a0''The Clone Wars''\u00a0TV series, Cad Bane was set to make an appearance during a four-episode arc starring him and\u00a0[[Boba Fett]]. The two were going to team up for a \"rescue mission\" on Tatooine where\u00a0[[Tusken Raiders]]\u00a0had kidnapped a child. It would emphasize Boba's and Cad's relation to one another as Cad had known Jango. Cad Bane would also get new\u00a0clothes\u00a0and a new ship called the \"Justifier\".\n*In a clip revealed during the Animated Origins and Unexpected Fates panel at\u00a0Celebration Orlando\u00a0in 2017, Cad Bane and other Bounty Hunters had ended an insurrection by Fett. To finish it, they engaged in a stand off duel.\n\n==External Links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Cad Bane|Wookieepedia}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
