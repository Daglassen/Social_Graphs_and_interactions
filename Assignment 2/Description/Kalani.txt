[[Danda]] is her grandmother. If Link speaks to Kalani while she is standing in front of her grandmother's [[Arrow Specialty Shop]], she encourages Link to buy lots of stuff.<ref>{{Cite|Vasaaq! Hey, lady! Be sure to buy a LOT of stuff, OK?|Kalani|BotW}}</ref> She also recommends each type of elemental [[Arrow]], saying that [[Bomb Arrow]]s go \"BOOOOOM!!!\", [[Shock Arrow]]s go \"BZZBZZT!!!\", [[Ice Arrow]]s go \"CRAAAAACK!!!\" and [[Fire Arrow]]s go \"BOOSH!!!\".<ref>{{Cite|I really recommend...{{Color|BotW Blue|bomb arrows}}!

I don't have time to hang around here greeting people like this! If I don't hurry, the vure will go away!|Kalani|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Kalani while she is staring at Frita, she comments about what a \"big vure\" she is.<ref>{{Cite|Whoa... That's a really big vure...|Kalani|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can find Kalani and the other three children in Gerudo Town speaking to each other as a group as the sun sets. Kalani asks them if they are in love.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, you guys! Are you in love?|Kalani|BotW}}</ref> [[Makure]] then responds that she wants to attend [[Ashai]]'s class when she grows up and get married.<ref>{{Cite|When I'm all growed up, I will be! I'll go to Miss Ashai's class, and I'll become in love and I'll get married!|Makure|BotW}}</ref> [[Pearle]] then comments that Ashai is unmarried and wonders what that means.<ref>{{Cite|Mom says it's really strange that Miss Ashai is unmarried but teaches her class on voe. I wonder what unmarried means...|Pearle|BotW}}</ref> Lastly, [[Dalia]] says that she heard being in love is the sweetest thing in the world, but does not think she can handle something sweeter than berries.<ref>{{Cite|I heard that being in love and being married is the sweetest thing in the world! But I really like berries, and those are really sweet. I don't know if I can handle something sweeter than that!|Dalia|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
