As zombies, the Undead can infect the living with a bite and transform them into other zombies. Due to their pale skin and bad attitudes, they are often mistaken for teenagers. They seem to have a hunger for brains.\n\nAccording to the \"Creature #6\" next to the species' name, they are implied to be the sixth creature to be written about in the book.\n\nThere is a cure for those who were infected by the Undead's bite which involves cinnamon and formaldehyde.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThe Undead was mentioned in the first episode \"[[Tourist Trapped]]\", where they were described to look a bit like teenage boys.\u00a0\n\nIn \"[[Scary-oke]]\", [[Dipper Pines]] accidentally summons a hoard of them to prove the Federal Agents that his Journal is real. Several of the zombies drag the agents away into the woods before attacking the [[The Mystery Shack|Mystery Shack]] and infect [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]], turning him into one of their own. When the zombies' weakness is discovered, Dipper, [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], and [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]] sing a court song and destroy the zombie hoard.\n\nIn \"[[Weirdmageddon Part 3: Take Back the Falls]]\", several zombies, including the late [[Mayor of Gravity Falls]], try to rise from the graveyard behind the Valentino family's funeral home, but the Valentino couple suppress them back into their graves.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nZombie revival by dipper.png\nZombie.png\nzombie hoard.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Undead}}\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
