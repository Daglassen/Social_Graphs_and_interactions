As he paces back and forth, carving a trench into the ground, the sudden\u00a0cries of newborn\u00a0hatchlings\u00a0call him back to the nest where the four perfect little yellow ducklings have been born.\n\nThe joyous father showers his mate and new ducklings with kisses until the final (and noticeably larger) egg hatches and out pops a strange looking white duckling. [[The Ugly Duckling (character)|Its]] awkward shape and loud honk - completely unlike the pudgy bodies and soft quacks of the ducklings - infuriates the father duck and he demands his mate explain why he is nothing like them. The spat quickly escalates until the father duck insinuates that no child of his could be so ugly and accuses his mate of being at fault for his appearance, prompting her to slap him with her wing. Thoroughly disgusted with the whole situation, he storms off and leaves his mate to deal with their ducklings on her own.\n\nIt is unknown if they ever reconciled as at the end of the film. He did not reappear along with his family when the Ugly Duckling (who's actually a cygnet whose egg somehow found its way into their nest) departs to be with his own.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAngry.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
