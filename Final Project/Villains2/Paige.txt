Separated from her [[The Grid|Grid]] \"family\" during a battle, she was rescued by [[General Tesler|Tesler]]. This resulted in a deep loyalty to him, which occasionally blinds her to his darker side. She is [[Beck]]'s chief antagonist and eventually, the object of his desire.\n\nPaige is blinded by her loyalty to Tesler and ultimately believes she is fighting for the right side when in reality she is helping to oppress the programs of the Grid.\n\nFor this innate goodness, Tesler himself does not give Paige his full trust, as he killed a program Paige had promised would be pardoned without her knowing.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nPaige's First Meeting with the Renegade.png|\"So you're [[Tron (character)|Tron]]?
