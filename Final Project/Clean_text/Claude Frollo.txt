witchcraft and sorcery infectious those around them according him which therefore makes him genocidal also shown have sadism other than his desire persecute sinners also briefly smiles when the previous Captain the Guard prior his promoting Phoebus the rank was heard being whipped for having failed him Surprisingly Frollo has been known somewhat forgiving person This evidenced how forgave Quasimodo for attempting deceive him order attend the Festival Fools and how equated the letter with forgiveness when teaching Quasimodo the alphabet Another example how the Victor Hugo and Laverne gargoyles seemed aware Frollo merciful side they suggested Frollo was more likely forgive Quasimodo for his defiance than permit him attend the Festival Fools also ultimately forgave Quasimodo for helping Esmeralda escape Notre Dame Paris Notre Dame believing the hunchback was under spell Esmeralda making Interestingly while most Disney villains know that what they wrong and they either not care take pride from this Frollo actually believes that good person the very least believes his actions are for the greater good making him something three dimensional character well repeatedly refuses find fault within himself and quite self righteous declaring himself much purer than the common vulgar weak licentious crowd and above the biblical doctrine that all men are equally sinful

ultimately proves his downfall when pushes Quasimodo too far almost killing Esmeralda When believes his lust for Esmeralda turning him sin partially right because this that makes him murderous and unfair towards the other people arresting families and attempting kill just because they wouldn give him Esmeralda Frollo also very cruel Quasimodo refuses allow the hunchback experience freedom forces the young man call him master and allows him humiliated public without even bothering help him punishment for disobeying him Additionally during Frollo outbursts Quasimodo tries move away from

cannot talk and attempt get Quasimodo believe this well Frollo Dear boy whomever are you talking Quasimodo friends Frollo see And what are your friends made Quasimodo Quasimodo Stone Frollo Can stone talk Quasimodo can Frollo That right You smart lad Furthermore Frollo appears rather stoic man always appearing cool and collected and only shows fear when Quasimodo overpowers him after prepares kill him and when about fall his death also shows visible fear when the many eyes Notre Dame glare him for murdering innocent woman upon the cathedral steps rarely exhibits any humor and whenever does dry and black Despite his single mindedness Frollo true weakness that cannot feel understand love for another person even when really tries was this cruelty and abusiveness that drove Quasimodo have very little loyalty towards his master and protect the first people who ever showed the hunchback true kindness namely Esmeralda and Phoebus Nevertheless Frollo does genuinely try good father Quasimodo while raising him but ultimately proves too full hate and arrogance caring parent Frollo also appears misanthrope with little sense personalization despite Quasimodo being the only person whom refers name refers his soldiers You men they prepare attack the cathedral and usually refers Esmeralda the gypsy girl the girl Frollo aging man defined his wrinkled care worn face and thinning white hair the Minister Justice and high ranking public official Frollo most frequently dressed black and purple robe purple jumpsuit purple and black striped tricorn hat with red tassel attached the bottom and

Hatter calling him Frumpy during the time that Goofy lets Daisy know that changed the seating chart that the audience could make new friends which did not work out also appears Mickey House Villains but not the villains that take over Instead only appears sitting next Ratigan crowd shot between the cartoon shorts taking place before the takeover During Jafar reign host however Frollo nowhere seen whatsoever implying that possibly left the club before Jafar plan started Frollo appears the fourth book Power Play seen Disney Hollywood Studios where attempts drown Isabella Angelo Willa commanding

they were the sole problem with Paris took care Quasimodo act contrition for killing Quasimodo mother hoped that Quasimodo would think like him and his emotional abuse was something that was unaware Frollo became consumed with lust for Esmeralda which drove him insane thought the cure was either possess her destroy her His fate changed between the versions the play are changed the German version the play thrown off the cathedral his death Quasimodo rather than falling off the crumbling gargoyle fixture the English version the play when Esmeralda awakens Frollo draws his sword and prepares kill both them but then stops drops the sword and leaves This was most likely included this version the play give Frollo chance redemption though whether not took that chance unknown the North American musical which follows much more closely the original novel Frollo and his younger brother Jehan were raised Notre Dame after they are orphaned While Frollo studied become priest Jehan

are foiled Frollo first encountered Quasimodo baby after killed Quasimodo mother his mother For the murder had take Quasimodo and raise him his own Frollo genuinely poses intimidating yet oddly influential father figure for the next twenty years However when Quasimodo twenty years old Frollo allows him tortured after attempts sneak out the bell tower for which forbidden leave also enraged when Quasimodo helps Esmeralda escape him and sneaks down the Court Miracles where the gypsies are hiding Frollo applauds him for finally proving useful him before forcing him back the bell tower this point Quasimodo has come hate Frollo and will help anyone who helps him such Esmeralda After Quasimodo goes against him battle Frollo hatred for him reaches its limits and Frollo attempts kill him like should have done twenty years ago However this ultimately leads Frollo own demise Frollo was just imagining rope around that beautiful neck Esmeralda know what you were imagining Frollo and Esmeralda Frollo Esmeralda archenemy and was serious threat her life Despite his power and authority she was not afraid him and rebelled against his rules Not only was she even brave enough publicly humiliate and insult him the Festival Fools also intriguing him bit well she even had the courage spit his face before attempted execute her note when Esmeralda and Frollo first meet she playfully brings his face close hers and kisses the tip his nose before pulling his hat down well performing seductive dance This however leads Frollo becoming unhealthily obsessed with her becoming the first link the chain that leads Paris destruction and Frollo ultimate demise While hating Esmeralda for being gypsy and humiliating and evading him Frollo had powerful feeling lust for her powerful was desperate find her and have her himself even that meant burning Paris the ground intent having Frollo evil and vile possible well being blinded the consequences his actions attempt https tvtropes org pmwiki pmwiki php Main AvertedTrope avert the trope https tvtropes org pmwiki pmwiki php Main EvilIsCool Evil Cool common many Disney villains However did not work despite their best efforts Frollo became popular villain anyway and some fans cases even inferred was closer being the good guy When Frollo falls his death the boiling inferno beneath clearly meant symbolize that his soul now trapped eternal damnation the satanic and demonic fires Hell for all eternity punishment for all his actions and ending his tyranny once and for all Ironically his final words life were And shall smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit referring Quasimodo and Esmerelda but himself was the wicked who was smitten and plunged into the fiery pit fact Frollo has committed many crimes the film and

Tony Jay performance Monsieur Arque what led the directors both films cast him Frollo also voiced Shere Khan various Jungle Book spin offs from 1990 2003 Frollo was Tony Jay most iconic voice role and has stated that was his favorite his entire career Frollo behavior strongly suggests that pyromaniac Also based his mannerisms implied that Frollo ambidextrous Frollo represents three the deadly sins Lust lusted after Esmeralda Pride considered himself above all humans and completely flawless although Hellfire shows him begging God for mercy both their souls least somewhat aware what plans sin Wrath desires punish and murder several innocent people seemingly felt guilty for his sins killing Quasimodo mother and his lust for Esmeralda though considering his self righteous personality tries without totally believing himself blame them external forces such the Devil Esmeralda even God himself whom blames for having made Man weaker than the Devil already said does not fully convince himself with those lies and still fears for his soul because those sins asking the Lord for mercy numerous times Frollo has the most screentime any major Disney villain fact appears for third the film running time The Hunchback Notre Dame characters"
