Fortunately, Team Lightyear arrives in time to stop him, and Fop Doppler drops a chandelier on him when he attempts to escape.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Angstrom is seen arrested and taken away for his crimes.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Good Ol' Buzz]]\", Lord Angstrom is seen yet again fresh out of prison. This time, he has his sights set on Mira, only to realize that by the older version of Buzz being there, Mira is oddly absent due to his time-meddling. Lord Angstrom is soon rounded up again, and taken into custody by [[Star Command]].\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angstrom}}\n{{Buzz Lightyear of Star Command}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Buzz Lightyear of Star Command characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
