[[The Evil Queen|Regina]] gives her a rose upon her visit to see a patient, and the nurse informs her no one has come to visit \"[[Belle]]\" that day.\nShe is approached by [[Mad Hatter|Jefferson]], who pretends to be part of the hospital staff, when he goes down to the psychiatric ward. He informs the nurse that all the commotion upstairs is about a boy whose heart is failing. The tea he gives her is drugged, and after taking a sip, she promptly passes out at the front desk. This gives Jefferson the opportunity to take the keys to the rooms, and free Belle.\nAfter the Dark Curse is broken she regains her memories as does everyone else in town.\n\nAfter the Curse, [[Little Red Riding Hood|Ruby]] visits Belle in the hospital after she loses her memory of the Enchanted Forest. The nurse must sedate Belle after she becomes aggravated and tells Ruby that she must be sedated often due to her condition.\nWhen [[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]] discovers that Belle is missing from her hospital bed, he calls the nurse in and asks where she is. The nurse replies that Belle should still be here, to which Gold angrily and impatiently asks where she is, causing the nurse to go and check.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n===Season One===\n*\"[[Skin Deep]]\"\n*\"[[A Land Without Magic]]\"\n===Season Two===\n*\"[[Tiny (Once Upon a Time)|Tiny]]\"\n*\"[[Lacey (Once Upon a Time)|Lacey]]\"\n===Season Four===\n*\"[[Mother]]\"\n{{Col-2}}\n===Season Five===\n*\"[[The Dark Swan]]\"\n*\"[[The Bear and the Bow]]\"\n*\"[[Birth]]\"\n===Season Six===\n*\"[[Broken Heart]]\"\n*\"[[The Other Shoe]]\"\n*\"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\"\n*\"[[The Final Battle (Once Upon a Time)|The Final Battle Part 1]]\"\n{{Col-end}}\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nOnce Upon a Time - 5x06 - The Bear and the Bow - Nurse Ratched.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 5x10 - Broken Heart - Nurse Ratched.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 6x21 - The Final Battle Part 1 - Emma and Nurse Ratched.jpg\nratched.png\nnurse-ratched.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{OnceUponATimeWiki}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
