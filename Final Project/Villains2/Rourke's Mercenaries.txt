They serve both [[Lyle Tiberius Rourke]] & [[Helga Sinclair]].\nThese mercenaries can be seen throughout the film during large group interactions and major events, such as the group's arrival in Atlantis, the confrontation [[Lyle Tiberius Rourke|Rourke]] has with [[Milo Thatch|Milo]] after the swim with [[Kida Nedakh|Kida]], and during the confrontation with Atlantis's king, [[Kashekim Nedakh]].\n\n== Appearance ==\nRourke's mercenaries are always shown wearing gas masks, with breathing tubes and blue lenses. This sets them apart from every other soldier and major character within the film. The masks are never removed, allowing them to appear impersonal and more intimidating visually.\n\n{{Stub}}\n{{Atlantis: The Lost Empire}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Atlantis: The Lost Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
