"[[File:Jigo.jpg|thumb|250 px|Jigo.]]'''Jigo''' was an antagonist in the [[1997]] [[Studio Ghibli]] film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''. In the Japanese version, he was voiced by Kaoru Kobayashi and in the English dub, he was voiced by [[Billy Bob Thornton]].\n\n== Personality ==\nJigo is not much of an antagonist in this movie. He just has this role as you can often see him interact and work with [[Lady Eboshi]] who her herself isn't much of a villain either.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ghibli/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|ghibli|Jigo|Ghibli Wiki}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Studio Ghibli}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Studio Ghibli characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Miramax characters]]"
