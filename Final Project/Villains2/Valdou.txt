By brainwashing the inhabitants and destroying the kingdom's glory, he had it all in his grasp. Though Rei lost his memory, they set on a journey to find the savior - the princess who is meant to salvage the kingdom with the [[Magic Tiara]]. Valdou, however, plans on using the opportunity to find and kill the princess to keep the kingdom the way it is.\n\nNear the end, it is revealed that he is a robotic humanoid, though whether\u00a0he was always one or was once a human who modified himself is unknown. The princess, [[Kilala Reno]], frees the kingdom's inhabitants from Valdou's control and helps create a battalion against Valdou's army of humanoid robots. He is killed by Rei in the end in a fit of\u00a0rage when he (Rei) believed Valdou killed Kilala in a fire.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nValdou's death.jpg|Valdou's death\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kilala Princess}}\n[[Category:Kilala Princess characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
