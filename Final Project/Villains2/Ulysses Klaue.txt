Klaue is an international terrorist, criminal, gangster, smuggler, arms dealer, and black-market man and an extremely major enemy for the [[Black Panther]], for which he is depicted as the Panther's arch-nemesis.\n\nHe made his first appearance as a minor antagonist in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in the [[2015]] [[Marvel Studios]] film, ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''. He later appears in the 2018 Marvel Studios film, ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' as the secondary antagonist.\n\nThe character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. \n\n==Background==\nUlysses Klaue is a black-market arms dealer, smuggler, and gangster operating out of South Africa. He is a former acquaintance of Tony Stark\u2019s from his weapons-dealing days. Klaue met Tony during a conference, however, he and Stark never made a deal. He was hired to take down [[T'Chaka]] at the Blinderberg conference in the case that he refused to negotiate Wakanda's resources, including Vibranium. He has a history with T'Chaka, as the Panther killed Klaue's great grandfather in the 19th Century while this one was trying to anex Wakanda. He was paid ten million dollars for the kill, which was unsuccessful.\n\nYears later, Klaue went to [[Wakanda]], where he stole large amounts of Vibranium. However, he was discovered by the Wakandian population, who decide to tattoo the word \"thief\" on his neck.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====\nAs he was the only person who had Vibranium in the world, [[Ultron]] and the Maximoff twins, [[Quicksilver|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] decide to visit him and make a deal. Klaue immediately recognizes the Maximoffs as Strucker's experiments. Klaue tells them that if they use their powers against him, he would know that they were both were not in charge and ordered them to talk to the man in charge. Suddenly, Ultron appears throwing Klaue from a window and told him he needed his Vibranium for his new body.\n\nKlaue tells Ultron that he could have the Vibranium but that would cost large sums of money; Ultron responded transferring billions of dollars to his bank account. Their alliance ends, when Klaue compared it with [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], causing the rage of Ultron. Ultron then proceeds to cut off Klaue's arm with his own hands. When the Avengers arrive, Klaw escapes before ordering his men to shoot at everyone.\n\n====''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''====\nSometime later, Klaue reappears working with [[Erik Killmonger]] to steal artifacts from a museum in London. He gleefully kills multiple people during the heist and reveals what he calls \"just a taste\" of the power of his prosthetic hand, which he has implanted himself following [[Ultron]]'s death.\n\nIn [[Wakanda]], [[Black Panther|T'Challa]] and the Wakandan Council discuss the theft and Klaue's history with Wakanda. We find out that the last time Klaue was in Wakanda\u2014some 30 years prior\u2014he killed many people, including the family of W'kabi (the head of Wakanda's Border Tribe and best friend to T'Challa). T'Challa plans to apprehend Klaue at an underground gambling establishment in Korea, where Klaue will be selling vibranium to an unknown buyer. W'Kabi blames T'Challa's father T'Chaka for not bringing Klaue to justice long ago and exacts a promise from T'Challa: kill Klaue on sight or bring him back to Wakanda as his father failed to do.\n\nT'challa, [[Nakia]], and [[Okoye]] (with [[Shuri]] assisting remotely) arrive at the club and find that the mysterious buyer is CIA agent [[Everett Ross]]. A chaotic firefight ensues, Klaue and his henchmen escape with T'Challa and the others in pursuit. After a road chase in which the powerful sonic cannon in Klaue's prosthesis temporarily gives him the upper hand, Klaue is eventually taken into Ross's custody.\n\nKlaue glibly mocks Ross during his interrogation and reveals the true nature of Wakanda. Before Ross has much of a chance to question T'Challa about Klaue's claims, Nakia runs in with a warning that something is up outback. Just then, Killmonger, Linbani, and Linda blow through the wall and free Klaue. But this relationship also sours quickly: Killmonger wants to go to Wakanda after killing Linbani, so Klaue takes Linda hostage, using her as a human shield. Killmonger assures Linda that everything will be fine, but kills her with no hesitation or remorse. After a bit of a gunfight, Killmonger manages to shoot Klaue, who was at a disadvantage with only one arm.\n\nKlaue sneers at Killmonger's supposed stupidity for wanting to go to Wakanda, showing him a brand they gave him while he was there as a sign of what happens to outsiders and asks Killmonger what makes him think he can get in. Killmonger shows him the hidden markings under his lips (his true name, N'Jadaka), revealing that he is the son of Prince N'Jobu, the very same Wakandan who was in league with Klaue before his death. Realizing this, Klaue simply finds it amusing to be played by someone he thought to be \"...just some crazy American\", and laughs maniacally before Killmonger kills him with another shot. Killmonger brings Klaue's body to Wakanda and delivers it to W'Kabi in order to be allowed to enter the country as part of his plan to overthrow T'Challa.\n\n===[[Marvel Animation]]===\n====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====\nKlaw with a group of mercenaries went to [[Wakanda]] to steal the [[Vibranium]], after killing the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, Klaw, and his men take the Vibranium but Hank using his powers manages to defeat the mercenaries and Klaw, Klaw runs away scared when is defeated by Ant-Man.\n\nLater, Klaw hires [[Whirlwind]] to steal a sonic disruptor, which he replaced his right hand with it. Klaw later helps Man-Ape to take control of Wakanda so as have the Vibranium when he wants.\n\nThe [[Grim Reaper]] soon decided Klaw had outlived his usefulness and attacked him. The overcharged Vibranium turned Klaw into a living sound creature. [[Iron Man]] and [[Henry Pym|Ant-Man]] stopped Klaw by containing his sound emitter (that had become the \"heart\" of the creature) inside a hollow Vibranium spike.\n\n====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====\nKlaw is a member of the Frightful Four. After [[Trapster]], one of the Four is defeated by [[Spider-Man]], the rest of the Four attack Midtown High School with the belief that Spider-Man is one of the students. They escape before the police arrive, but are later defeated by Spider-Man and his team.\n\n====''[[Avengers Assemble]]''====\n[[Hawkeye]] is first contacted by [[Iron Man]] right after he stopped [[Trapster]], Klaw, and [[Wizard (Marvel)|Wizard]] from committing a robbery.\n\n==Gallery==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBlack Panther (film) 31.jpg|Klaue in ''Black Panther''\nBlack Panther (film) 17.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) 16.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) 04.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) 02.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) 01.jpg\nBlack Panther photography 19.jpg\nWhat If...? - 1x06 - What If...
