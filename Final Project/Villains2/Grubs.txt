Like the [[Little Green Men|LGMs]], they all look identical. They are blue and resemble [[wikipedia:Armadillidium vulgare|rolly pollies]] in body structure, but unlike rolly pollies, have large eyes and mouths.\n\nIt is unknown how long they have worked for the Evil Emperor Zurg, but they are serving him against their will.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Zurg likes to use them as bowling pins when he's in the mood for a game of \"Evil Bowling\".\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Buzz Lightyear of Star Command}}\n[[fi:Toukat]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Buzz Lightyear of Star Command characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bugs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
