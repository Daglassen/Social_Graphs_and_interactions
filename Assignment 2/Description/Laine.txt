Greetings, Hylian. This is the {{Color|BotW Blue|northwest gate}} of Gerudo Town. Feel free to admire it from the outside.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> When [[Link]] tries to enter Gerudo Town without a [[Gerudo Set|disguise]], Laine will stop him from entering and tell him that she cannot allow a man to go inside.<ref>{{Cite|I cannot allow a voe to go any farther. I must ask you to leave at once.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> When Link speaks to Laine, she tells him that it is safe in the Town, but that she cannot allow a man inside by Town law.<ref>{{Cite|It's safe within the walls of the city, but I can't let a voe like you inside.|Laine|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|But don't attempt to cross its threshold. Town law states voe like yourself are not allowed within these walls.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> Laine suggests that Link goes back to the [[Kara Kara Bazaar]] if he seeks shelter.<ref>{{Cite|If it's shelter you seek, you'll have to head back to {{Color|BotW Blue|Kara Kara Bazaar}}.|Laine|BotW}}</ref>\n\nLink can also receive the [[Shrine Quest]], \"[[The Silent Swordswomen]]\", by speaking to Laine. She tells Link that she is impressed that Link got to Gerudo Town from the northwest,<ref>{{Cite|Though I must admit I'm impressed you got here from the northwest.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> asking if he passed through the sandstorm to get there.<ref>{{Cite|Did you truly pass through that {{Color|BotW Red|sandstorm}} to get here?|Laine|BotW}}</ref> If Link says yes, Laine will deny it and say that it is impossible.<ref>{{Cite|No, that would be impossible...|Laine|BotW}}</ref> If Link says no, Laine does not find that surprising and goes on to explain that a Gerudo sandstorm has the \"temperament of a raging stallion.\"<ref>{{Cite|Of course you didn't.|Laine|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|A Gerudo sandstorm has the temperament of a raging stallion.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> Laine warns Link to keep his distance from sandstorms and that even Gerudo get lost in them.<ref>{{Cite|There aren't even many Gerudo who would risk being caught in a sandstorm. You should keep your distance.|Laine|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|If you wander into one, you'll lose all sense of direction. Even us Gerudo are in a bind if one seizes upon us.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> She goes on to explain that the ancients used storms to their advantage and hid treasure in them.<ref>{{Cite|But the ancients were able to use the storms to their advantage. It's said they hid all manner of treasure here.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> When Link asks about the treasure, Laine says that she does not know all the details,<ref>{{Cite|Having said that, I don't really know the details either.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> but tells Link of a superstition that the statues of swordswomen scattered across the [[Gerudo Desert]] are said to point to the ancient treasure.<ref>{{Cite|There are {{Color|BotW Red|statues of swordswomen}} scattered across Gerudo Desert. They're remnants of ages long past.|Laine|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|People talk about the statues pointing to the hiding place of ancient treasure...but that's just superstition.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> Laine comments that even if it was true, the threat of the dangerous monsters in the sandstorms are not worth the risk.<ref>{{Cite|Even if it was true, there are dangerous monsters in the sandstorms. I wouldn't risk it.|Laine|BotW}}</ref> After Laine is finished speaking, Link receives the Shrine Quest.
