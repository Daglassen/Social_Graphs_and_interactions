He is first mentioned in \"[[Paradise Lost]]\", and makes his first appearance in \"[[The New Deal]]\". He is a member of [[HYDRA]], and father of [[Gideon Malick]], who later goes on to become a prominent head. The Chronicoms Hunters make it their mission to travel back in time, to [[1931]] to terminate Freddy, who was responsible for the delivery of the incomplete Super Soldier Serum, which transformed Johann Schmidt into the [[Red Skull]]. Following this, he ascends into both HYDRA, and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], working as a double agent, and allies himself with the Chronicoms, to bring S.H.I.E.L.D. down. He is portrayed by Darren Barnet and Neal Bledsoe.\n\n==History==\nFreddy Malick was born into a wealthy family. They had a lot of money, until the Great Depression rendered them bankrupt, and one day Freddy finds his dead father, who killed himself, by throwing himself out the window. The grief leaves his mother, mentally unstable, unable to speak, and Freddy eventually because a homeless youth, hustling on the streets. [[Gemini (Marvel)|Ernest Keonig]] finds him and takes him in, offering him a wage, and shelter at a discounted rate. By [[1931]], Freddy runs Keonig's safehouse, speakeasy, in [[New York City]], used to illegally consume alcohol.<ref name=\"TND\">\"[[The New Deal]]\"</ref><ref name=\"KYO\">\"[[Know Your Onions]]\"</ref>\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Alternate Timeline=\nWhile working at Koenig's bar, Freddy allows two men (Agents [[Alphonso Mackenzie|Mack]] and [[Phil Coulson (LMD)|Coulson]], from the future) to enter, believing they're entering the establishment as consumers. When the two men make a request for Koenig, Freddy secures the perimeter, to prevent them from escaping, under the belief they are a threat. The two eventually organise a meeting with Keonig. While Freddy is cleaning in the back, Keonig explains how he helped him, before reprimanding him for accidentally breaking a bottle. Freddy later goes on duty, at a political party, organised for the governor of Albany, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He is joined by Mack, and wonders why he is in awe of FDR, unaware of his future political position. When [[Deke Shaw|Deke]] asks Freddy how he ended up in his position, he explains how Koenig found him, following his fathers death, and offered him an opportunity to work for him. During the party, he makes contact with [[Viola]], a woman who worked with his father, and held admiration for him, prior to his death. She offers Freddy a chance to restore his family's former glory, by delivering a set [[Super Soldier Serum|vials]] to the docks, she ominously refers to, as \"the future\". As Freddy accepts, he is ambushed by Chronicom Hunters, who seek to eliminate him. They shoot Viola, before setting their sights on Freddy. Before they can kill him, [[Quake]] uses her powers to defend him from his attackers, by blasting them into another room. Mack and Shaw evacuate Freddy from the building, unaware of why he is being targeted.<ref name=\"TND\"/>\n\nThe trio manage to safely escape, and Freddy has Deke and Mack change into civilian clothing, as the pair insist on joining him, for the delivery. Freddy covers the truth, by claiming he is expected to deliver alcohol, though, the pair seem to be aware he is lying. As they leave, Freddy slips one of the vials, into a bottle, before joining them. They stop by the railway, five hundred miles away the desired destination, where Freddy tries to dismiss them, but the pair insist on joining him, and seeing this through to the end. The three of them board the train together, and Freddy admires Deke's transmitter, fascinated by the advanced technology. Deke asks Freddy about himself, and in a moment of vulnerability, Freddy divulges about his past, and parentage. He also shares his future ambitions, he'll be afforded, once the delivery is over, dismissing the importance and impact, this delivery is set, to make on the world. He eventually falls asleep, only to be awoken by Deke's transmitter, and finds his comrades, browsing through his delivery crates. He angrily questions Mack's intentions, still trying to maintain his cover, and as the pair continue to rummage, Freddy points a gun at them, demanding they stop. Freddy questions their motives in joining him, and they reveal they were sent to protect him. When they question the dangers this mission will entail, Freddy reassures them of his safety, as he was sent on the mission by Viola, who was a family-friend. The train abruptly comes to a halt, leaving Freddy distracted, and Mack tackles him to the ground, while Deke takes the gun, and Freddy reveals they have arrived. They leave the train and he Mack make preparations for the delivery, while Deke is talking on his transmitter. During their preparations, Mack comes across the vial Freddy slipped into the bottle and removes it. Mack demands to know what it is, and Deke reveals his identity, as future father of [[Gideon Malick]], who goes on to become of the heads. As Freddy questions how they know about the organisation, Deke pulls his gun towards Freddy, upon learning of the future crimes, destined to take place, with [[HYDRA]]'s formation. Freddy protests his innocence, and as Deke lowers the weapon, two Chronicoms appear, and aim fire at them. Freddy hides behind a crater, and manages to escape with the vial, while Mack and Deke, fight the Chronicoms, along with their newly joined allies. As Freddy reloads his gun in an empty warehouse, Koenig appears and pleads with Freddy, to not partake in the mission. Freddy, insistent on not becoming like his father, ignored Koenig, and shoots him in the shoulder. A black car arrives, and Freddy enters, leaving Koenig, and completes the delivery.<ref name=\"KYO\"/>\n\nMalick eventually joins HYDRA, rising through the ranks, while simultaneously, working in S.H.I.E.L.D., as an undercover agent, so that he may take down the organisation, from the inside.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nBy [[1955]], [[Daniel Sousa]] learns of HYDRA's infiltration and reports to Wilfred, with plans to expose them. Sousa plans on delivering a device to [[Howard Stark]] created by Lindmore, a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist, and Malick orders the pair to be killed. He receives an anonymous phone call, revealing that Sousa is on a train, and set to arrive at the Hotel Roosevelt in [[Los Angeles]]. His men find Lindmore, already dead, and take another man, who was in his house, to Malick. He protests his innocence, by claiming he is a toaster salesman, and Wilfred kills one of his subordinates, over his incompetence. As the man pleas for his life, he addresses him as Freddy, revealing he is the Deke Shaw of 1931, who helped him deliver the super soldier serum. Malick realizes he is telling the truth, and spares his life, now paying off his debt, though warns he may not have the same luck, should the two encounter each other again. When questioning Deke about why he was at Lindmore's house, Deke tells him that he was looking out for his future, a sentiment Malick believes, everyone shares. When Sousa arrives at the hotel, Malick's men confirm they have had Sousa killed, though report, that the device he was set to deliver, was not with him. Later on that evening, a man reveals himself, from the shadows on Malick's office, and he recognizes his voice, as the one who called him about Sousa. The mysterious man, proclaims they share an enemy, though his is from the future. Malick believes this to be true, having seen Deke not aged after twenty-four years. The mysterious man reveals S.H.I.E.L.D. is set to destroy, everything he has built up, and the only way to stop them, is by doing as he says.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nThe man reveals himself as a Chronicom, a synthetic and biological being from another planet, and the future, providing information on S.H.I.E.L.D., effectively changing the timeline, and preventing Malick's premature death, in [[1970]]. He also helps set off [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Project INSIGHT]], a plan to take down S.H.I.E.L.D. from within, forty years earlier, than it's occurrence in the original timeline. Project INSIGHT involves placing SHIELD Helicarriers in the sky, and linking them to targeting satellites, which would, unknowingly to S.H.I.E.L.D., target assets, what would be a future threat, to HYDRA. Malick keeps the list of targets on his personal computer. Luke also makes Malick aware of their shared enemies, a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, also travelling from the future, who may try to prevent his plans, that he has had a previous encounter with. At an unknown point in time, Malick has two children, Nathaniel and [[Gideon Malick]].<ref name=\"ATITM\">\"[[A Trout in the Milk]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x05 - A Trout in the Milk - Wilfred Malick.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]\nBy [[1973]], Project INSIGHT is in the process of completion. Malick arrives in the bar, The Krazy Kanoe to celebrate the success of the project with his sons, and fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. coworkers, who remain oblivious, to his ties with HYDRA. He gives a speech, where he recalls his early life, working there, and Project INSIGHT's capabilities, in celebration. As he finishes, he notes Coulson's presence in the bar, and approaches him, under the guise of giving his thanks. When asking for his identity, Coulsom plays coy, though Malick confirms he is aware of his identity, by commanding the presence of multiple Chronicoms at the bar. Having dropped the act, Malick tells Coulson he remembers him, from their encounter, forty-two years prior. He holds Coulson and his team hostage, demanding they surrender, but before they can be given a choice, he finds his son Nathaniel being held hostage. Coulson counters his offer, to free them, in exchange for his son, and when Malick protests his innocence, May explains it doesn't matter, as Nathaniel is a consequence of the ripple effect, and only alive, because of the changed timeline. The Chronicoms are ready to kill the agents, but Malick orders them to stand down, in exchange for his son. He is reprimanded by Luke, who cannot comprehend the reasons for his decision.<ref name=\"ATITM\"/>\n\nIn [[1976]], Project INSIGHT is ready to take off. Malick views the launch of the project, from his estate window, and finds himself in the presence of Luke, who has returned to him, three years later, and reveals he was expecting the Chronicoms to return today. Luke demands an explanation, for what he perceives, as a transgression, at the bar, during his run-in with S.H.I.E.L.D., in 1973. Malick questions why, explaining it was three years, and wondering if he's still angry. Luke explains to him, that Chronicoms cannot get angry, and they simply adapt, even explaining how Malick taught them a lesson about human behavior that day - about the importance of relationships between humans, which he cites as a flaw, that they've been able to exploit. He further explains that their Predictor, [[Sibyl]] has foreseen that S.H.I.E.L.D. will find him, and prepares him for their arrival, by handing a envelope, which he cites as \"leverage\". Malick opens it, to finds the names of a married couple, who have been taken hostage by the Chronicoms, and when Malick asks why he doesn't simply place them on the list, Luke explains it will not be as effective, and they can exploit the relationship, as it will force S.H.I.E.L.D. to reveal themselves, and give up their position. As INSIGHT gets closer to launch, Malick finds himself confronted by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Deke and [[Yo-Yo|Yo-Yo]]. He is held at gunpoint by Deke, and confesses he was aware they would arrive, having been told by the Chronicoms. They inform him the launch won't be happening, though Malick simply remarks they're unaware of what they're up against. Yo-Yo insists he return with them and confess, but Malick refuses. He shows them the brown envelope, explaining he has something they want, but the pair are uninterested, demanding he answers for his crimes. Malick divulges that the Chronicoms have always been one step ahead of them, aware of how the situation would unfold, and as he does so, Deke suddenly shoots him in the head, killing him instantly.<ref name=\"ATITM\"/>\n|-|Original Timeline=\nFreddy eventually joins HYDRA, rising through the ranks, while simultaneously, working in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], as an undercover agent, so that he may take down the organisation, from the inside. By [[1955]], [[Daniel Sousa]] learns of HYDRA's infiltration, and reports to Wilfred, with plans to expose them, unaware his superior is also the enemy. Sousa plans on delivering a device to [[Howard Stark]] created by Lindmore, a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist, and Malick has the pair killed.<ref name=\"OOTP\">\"[[Out of the Past]]\"</ref>\n\nAt an unknown point in time, Malick had two children, [[Nathaniel Malick|Nathaniel]] and [[Gideon Malick|Gideon]].\nMalick belongs to a religious sect, within HYDRA, that worship the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]], known as [[Hive|Alveus]]. In this religious sect, when its members come of age, they take part in a ceremony, in which participants draw stones from a bag, one of which is white. The member who draws the white stone, is chosen as their Traveler. They are then absorbed by the Monolith and transported to Maveth, where they will be sacrificed to Alveus. Malick cheated his way, into not being selected, by obscuring a stone, which he familiarized himself with, so that when it was time to choose one, he didn't pick the stone that would mark his death. Malick's views on what HYDRA is, and it's religious traditions, differed from those of [[Daniel Whitehall]]'s scientific ones, and he passes his values, onto his children. He eventually passes away in [[1970]].<ref>\"[[Paradise Lost (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Paradise Lost]]\"</ref><ref name=\"ATITM\"/>\n</tabber>\n\n==Quotes==\n{{Quote|Curiosity can get you killed, faster than trust.\"|Freddy Malick|Know Your Onions}}\n{{Quote|I'm going to be somebody.|Freddy Malick|Know Your Onions}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode \"[[A Trout in the Milk]]\", Malick has a computer, which lists targetted [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] assets, including; Ben Taylor, Susan Morse, James Cook, [[Isabelle Hartley]], Mark Roberts, Ronald Collins, Susan Parker, Natahn Bowen, Gabe Jones, Conrad Murphy, [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], [[Victoria Hand]], Ben Harris, Betty Wright, Michael Phillips, Roger Stewart, Margaret Nelson, Leonard Terres, Jis Morita, [[Robert Gonzales]], Robert Meere, Thomas Hall and David Robinson.\n**The names include characters previously seen or referenced, prior, in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x01 - The New Deal - Photography - Freddy.jpg\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - 7x05 - A Trout in the Milk - Wilfred Malick.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malick, Freddy}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:HYDRA agents]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
