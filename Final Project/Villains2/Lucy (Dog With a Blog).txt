"{{Infobox character\n|image = Lucy.jpg\n|name = Lucy\n|shows = ''[[Dog With a Blog]]''\n|voice = Rachel Butera\n|personality = Aggressive, hostile\n|alignment = Bad\n|weapons = Her beak}}'''Lucy''' is a parrot [[Ellen Jennings|Ellen]] adopted in ''[[Dog With a Blog]]''. She is voiced by Rachel Butera.\n\n==Character History==\nEllen bought her because Avery suggested she become an animal person. When introduced to the family, she was very hostile and aggressive.\n\nLucy's annoying squawking rapidly kept the family up at night.\n\nStan let her out of her cage in an attempt to get rid of her, but she flew back in through the door. Ellen eventually sided with the family, after Lucy continuously dug her claws into her head, causing it to bleed, although at first she was hesitant to show it. Ellen tried getting rid of Lucy by opening the door and trying to let her go. When she was gone, Ellen finally caved and admitted to hating the bird from the start.\n\nAt the park, Lucy's \"Tyler's a jerk\" gave [[Rebecca Davis|Rebecca]] a \"sign\" that she shouldn't go out with him. Tyler recommends it's just one bird's opinion until a flock of other parrots, who Lucy met, kept repeating what she said.\n\n==Personality==\nLucy proves to be hostile and aggressive towards the James-Jennings' family, even Ellen. Her constant squawking annoys them.\n\nLucy, like every parrot, has this typical habit of repeating what she heard.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*''[[The Parrot Trap]]''\n\n===Season Two===\n*''[[Stan Makes His Mark]]''\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''Stan Makes His Mark'', it's revealed that Lucy has a new owner.\n\n{{Dog With a Blog}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Lucy}}\n[[Category:Dog with a Blog characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
