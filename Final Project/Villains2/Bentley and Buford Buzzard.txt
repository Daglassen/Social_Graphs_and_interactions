They are the  Imperfect clones of [[Bradford Buzzard]], created to aid him in undermining [[Scrooge McDuck]] from within his own company as Scrooge's [[Board of Directors]] and helped Scrooge McDuck in managing his finances.\n\nBentley and Buford, along with Bradford, were eventually revealed to be the High Command of [[F.O.W.L.]], and clones of Bradford meant to help him take over the world as his silent partners.\n\nBentley and Buford first appeared in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales reboot]] premier, \"[[Woo-oo!]]\", and made their final appearance in the series finale, \"[[The Last Adventure!]]\" where Bradford eliminates them once they've outlived their usefulness to him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nFile:Concept Art of Bradford.jpg|Concept Art\nThe Board of Buzzard.jpg\nF.O.W.L..jpg\nBuzzard Brothers.jpg\nFOWL Commands 4.webp\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bentley and Buford are two of the few characters to die in the show.\n*In the first episode, Buford doesn't seem to have his hair, but between the premiere and \"[[The Great Dime Chase!]]\", he seems to have grown hair. However in \"[[Last Christmas!]]\", he seemed to have hair long before \"[[Woo-oo!]]\", meaning that this is simply a case of design change.\n*A plot hole created by the first episode is that Bentley is shown seated center and speaking, with [[Bradford Buzzard|Bradford]] off to the side and not speaking. All subsequent episodes have Bradford seated center and speaking, with it later revealed that the other two are clones who cannot speak in complete sentences.\n*However, the two are capable of speaking single words or short sentences, such as \"Aye,\" or \"I don't know,\" as seen in \"[[The Great Dime Chase!]]\" and \"[[Last Christmas!]]\", Respectively.\n*It could be theorized from this plot hole that Bentley was meant to take Bradford's place as the chairman of the [[Board of Directors]], and maybe even the leader of [[F.O.W.L.]], and the main antagonist of Season 3.\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]"
