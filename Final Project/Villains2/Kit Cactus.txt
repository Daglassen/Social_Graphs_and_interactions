He is a mean bandit cactus and voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]].\nKit Cactus is similar in appearance to [[Toby (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Toby]]. The difference is that Kit is a lighter shade of green, wears a black hat with a red band, and, as a bandit, has a rude attitude. He used his appearance to fool the townsfolk of [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] and frame Toby for the crimes he pulled off. But when Kit ended up running into Toby, [[Sheriff Callie|Callie]] and [[Deputy Peck|Peck]] tried a \"spot the impostor\" test to find out who the real Toby was. Finally, Toby performed the popcorn trick he had shown Peck earlier, proving he was the real Toby, and Callie arrested Kit.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nKit demands 5 shakes.png\nKit Cactus steals a bite.png\nBlame it on Toby.png\nKit Cactus stolen hats.png\nKit Cactus steals watches.png\nKit Cactus Prairie Dogs.png\nKit about to poke Clementine.png\nKit and Toby collide.png\nTobyPeckKit SC56 1.png\nKit Cactus Busted.png|Kit Cactus gets busted\nKit Cactus grumbling.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
