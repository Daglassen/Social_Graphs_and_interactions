Cursed Moblins are Enemies in Breath of the Wild.


== Characteristics ==

Cursed Moblins appear to be the dismembered heads of Stalmoblins wreathed in Malice, which has somewhat brought them back to life. The only part of their life they retain is the ferocity of a Moblin, so they'll attack anything they see. Cursed Moblins tend to charge at Link after chomping their jaws. They can be defeated with a single strike from any Weapon. Cursed Moblins can be found in Divine Beasts and the two gatehouses in Hyrule Castle. As is the case with all cursed enemies, they will continuously spawn from Malice pools. Destroying the eye spawning the heads will stop them from spawning.
