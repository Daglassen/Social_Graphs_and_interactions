Guardian Scout I can be found in Ancient Shrines that involve fighting. While other Guardians were made to combat Calamity Ganon, Guardian Scouts were made specifically for the trials insideAncient Shrines. They are the weakest of all the Guardian Scout, and have no ancient weaponry at their disposal.
These types of Guardians can be found in many Ancient Shrines. Though they remain uncorrupted in Ancient Shrines, their corrupted versions can be found inside Divine Beasts. They also appear in the Trial of the Sword during The Master Trials DLC Pack, as well as the Final Trial as part of The Champions' Ballad DLC Pack.
