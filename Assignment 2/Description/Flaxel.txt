They're four travelers named {{Color|BotW Blue|Oliff}}, {{Color|BotW Blue|Flaxel}}, {{Color|BotW Blue|Canolo}}, and {{Color|BotW Blue|Palme}}....|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> However, the five of them were attacked by {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin|link}} on the path to {{Term|BotW|Koukot Plateau|link}} and ended up separated.<ref>{{Cite|I don't know... We were all walking together when some monsters suddenly jumped us near the {{Color|BotW Blue|Koukot Plateau path}}.|Sesami|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Canyon Stable|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} can find Sesami, who managed to escape.<ref>{{Cite|I took off running and didn't stop until I got here.|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> He asks Link to let Flaxel and the rest of his friends know that he's waiting for them at the Stable.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, if you happen to run into any of my friends on the road, please let them know Sesami is waiting for them here.|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> This initiates the {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}} \"{{Term|BotW|Missing in Action|link}}\".\n\nFlaxel is found on the southeastern edge of the Koukot Plateau. When Link saves her from the {{Term|BotW|Blue Bokoblin|link}} attacking her, she thanks him for his help.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks for the assists, pal. That could've been the end of me.|Flaxel|BotW}}</ref> She remarks on how sore she'll be tomorrow, calling the {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin|link}} filthy bottom-feeders.<ref>{{Cite|Boy, I'm gonna be sore tomorrow. Filthy bottom-feeders...|Flaxel|BotW}}</ref> Flaxel is angry when she finds out Sesami has been at the Gerudo Canyon Stable the whole time,<ref>{{Cite|So Sesami was kicking his feet up in the stable while I was being tortured by those sorry sacks?!|Sesami|BotW}}</ref> at which point she decides to give him a piece of her mind.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, I'm going to go give him a piece of my mind, all right. A piece of my fist, too!|Flaxel|BotW}}</ref>\n\nBack at Gerudo Canyon Stable, Flaxel admits that she was going to yell at Sesami for leaving her, but she stopped once she saw his face.<ref>{{Cite|I was gonna yell at Sesami for leaving me to die, but as soon as he saw my face, he looked like he was gonna start sobbing...|Flaxel|BotW}}</ref> She can't bring herself to be mad at him for being scared, since that's the way he is.<ref>{{Cite|I can't be mad at him for being scared.
