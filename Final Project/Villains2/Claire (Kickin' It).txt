She is a rich girl going to Seaford High's biggest rival, Swathmore Academy.\n\n==About==\nClaire is rich as seen when she only bought food from Falafel Phil's to feed her pug. She is fairly pretty and knows it because she was very confident that she would win the Pearl of Seaford beauty pageant.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Kim===\nClaire treats [[Kim Crawford|Kim]] as though she was an ugly poor girl and goes far enough to say she isn't beauty pageant material. She thinks only girls from Swathmore Academy can win the pageant. When Kim came into the dojo and bumped into her she called her a sweaty girl in pajamas.\n\n\n[[Category:Kickin' It characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
