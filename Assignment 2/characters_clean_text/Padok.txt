Padok is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Padok is the owner of the Highland Stable, where he receives incoming guests and registers Horses. When Link first meets him, Padok offers to teach Link about the Stable network across Hyrule Kingdom which boards and registers Wild Horses to travelers, officially making them companions to the person who registers them, as well as explaining the limit of five Horses that can be boarded. He also offers to teach Link how to catch Wild Horses, should he not know how.
Padok will also direct any travelers seeking a rest inside of the Highland Stable, where they can stay. If Link asks to register a Horse, Padok will charge Link 20 Rupees to support the Stable conservation efforts and to cover the cost of a Saddle and Bridle for the new Horse companion. Upon paying the fee, Padok will allow Link to name his Horse. After registration, Padok will ask Link whether he would take the Horse with him, or if he would like to board it inside the Stable. As parting words, Padok will teach Link about Whistling to attract his Horse, noting that Horses have a limited range of hearing.
