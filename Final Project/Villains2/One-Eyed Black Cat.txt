In said story, an alcoholic man and his wife have a menagerie of pets including a black cat named '''Pluto'''. In a drunken rage one night, the man uses a pen to carve out one of Pluto's eyeballs though he regrets doing so after. Unable to cope with the cat as a living reminder of his loss of control, the man kills Pluto by hanging it from the neck in the tree outside his house.\n\nFollowing this event, the man's house burned down leaving him and his wife to find a new home. At this new home, they came upon a one-eyed black cat nearly identical to Pluto, albeit for a white patch on its chest which the man saw as being in the shape of a gallows. The couple took in this cat and and gave it the name of Pluto in tribute to their old beloved pet though the husband was neurotically afraid of the creature. One night the man had a complete breakdown due to fearing the cat and his wife not believing him so he took a hatchet and murdered his wife.\n\nThe husband stuffed his wife's corpse in an out-of-use chimney within the basement and bricked over it. When police arrived, they began to hear a sound coming from the chimney which they noticed was recently bricked over. To the man's protest, they tore open the chimney and within found the wife's corpse with the one-eyed black cat sitting atop it. The man was subsequently arrested and it is ultimately left ambiguous as to if the cat was truly supernatural or a figment of his broken mind.\n\n====The Haunted Mansion====\nThe One-Eyed Black Cat was the main-antagonist of the Haunted Mansion in an unused script written by [[Xavier Atencio|X. Atencio]]. Guests would have been warned by the [[Ghost Host]] at the beginning of the ride to beware the cat as it is a powerful being which has a hatred of mortals. The red-glowing slit eye of the cat would watch guests throughout the attraction, until eventually appearing as an undead cat's head. This head would then transform into the rotting corpse of a human as guests made their escape.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[Disney Parks]]===\n\n====The Haunted Mansion====\n\n=====[[Disneyland]]=====\nIn [[2021]], a statue of the black cat was integrated into the interior queue of the Haunted Mansion.
