It was then revealed that the reason for his disappearance was because he decided to change sides and become an evil mastermind in an operation for various crimes involving gators. He is first seen meeting two German specialists; [[Horst and Klebb|Klebb and Horst]] (actually Daisy and Donald impersonating them) he was expecting to help him with his \"big plan.\"\n\nAt night, while Donald is put through a test by the Colonel, the Colonel somewhat flirts with Daisy over dinner. Daisy, on the other hand, rejects the flirting and tries to get some information from the Colonel about his \"big plan.\" But the Colonel decides to discuss it in the morning and has Donald thrown in the brig (with his nephews, who were captured earlier by the [[Colonel's Thugs|Colonel's thugs]]) by Daisy for failing the test.\n\nIn the morning, the Colonel reveals to Daisy that he intends to rob a gold depository while avoiding a special security system that harms humans in sight but has no effect on animals. When Daisy deduces that he's going to use the alligators he stole earlier from Cal Crudon as a safe way of getting in without being seen and harmed by the security system and blow the vault open with a tank, the Colonel rejoices and finds ''her'' idea more brilliant since his original plan was to disguise the gators as vacuum cleaner salesmen and storm the place; much to Daisy's dismay.\n\nThen, the Colonel's thugs bring in \"two impostors posing as Horst and Klebb\"; which causes Daisy to blow her cover after spitting out her real name after arguing with the real Klebb.\n\nLater, the Colonel approaches the depository in a tank with the ducks tied up and roped to it as he watches his thugs and the specialists executing the \"big plan\"; using the stolen alligators as cover from the security system.\n\nAfter the task is complete, the Colonel; in his tank, breaks into the place while his men stand guard. The ducks; having escaped the tank with the help of a female alligator named [[Antoinette]] who has a crush on Donald and one of Cal Crudon's loyal gators, defeat the minions while Daisy takes care of the Colonel. In doing so, she accidentally destroys the depository and finally shoots the Colonel out of his tank far away; never to be seen or heard from again.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nColonel Quack Pack1.jpg|The Colonel meeting Daisy and Donald impersonating  as Klebb and Horst\nColonel Quack Pack2.jpg\nColonel Quack Pack3.jpg\nColonel Quack Pack4.jpg|The Colonel discussing his \"big plan\" with Daisy\nColonel Quack Pack5.jpg\nColonel Quack Pack6.jpg\nColonel Quack Pack7.jpg\nColonel Quack Pack8.jpg|The Colonel's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Quack Pack}}\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Colonels]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
