Dai is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Dai is a Hylian traveler who can be found outside the Coliseum Ruins. He is equipped with a Traveler's Sword and a Fisherman's Shield. Link can initially find him trembling near the entrance to the Coliseum Ruins, looking on in terror at the Lynel inside. If it is Raining, Dai will blame his trembling on the Rain.
Upon speaking to Dai, he will be spooked by Link's presence and consequently chide him for scaring him. Afterwards, Dai will explain that he is attempting to slay the monsters inside the Ruins for the treasure and Weaponry they guard. If Link speaks to him a second time, Dai will boast about his skills in battle or suggest that Link scouts out the area first. However, Dai will not actually go into the Coliseum Ruins. At midnight, Dai will fall asleep against the wall that he hides behind, dreaming of defeating the monsters inside the Ruins. Dai will wake up and resume his activities at 05:00 AM.
If Link defeats the Lynel inside the Coliseum Ruins and returns to Dai, he will give Link a Silver Rupee, valued at 100 Rupees, for his trouble. He will then tell Link that he can handle the situation on his own and bids him farewell.
