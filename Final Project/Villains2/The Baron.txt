He is a notorious kingpin that has a history with [[Flynn Rider]] and [[Lance Strongbow]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Baron rules the city of Vardaros, residing in a luxurious castle with his daughter, [[Stalyan]]. He is a deeply feared member of the criminal underworld and has allied himself with other thieves such as Flynn and Lance to carry out his bidding throughout regions beyond Vardaros itself. The Baron, however, does not appear to partake in actual operations on the field. He instead spends the majority of his time at his castle, feeding his swans and wallowing in luxury. Almost no one ever sees him.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he cannot be trusted and has betrayed his accomplices before. He, however, is not immune to being betrayed, himself\u2014Flynn, Lance, Angry, and Red are all known to have crossed the Baron at least once. He holds special disdain for Flynn, who, at one point, broke Stalyan's heart by refusing to marry her. Those who cross the Baron are subjected to a slow and painful death at the bite of a venomous Kai spider he keeps in his ring.\n\n==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==\n===Season one===\nThe Baron is first mentioned in \"[[The Return of Strongbow]]\" where, eight years in the past, Weasel betrays Flynn and Lance during a royal caravan robbery. As he makes off with the goods, Weasel notes that his actions were \"Baron's orders\". Eight years later, Lance ropes Flynn (now going by his real name, Eugene) into robbing the Baron's treasury, which they accomplish.\n\nIn \"[[Big Brothers of Corona]]\", the Baron sends Weasel and his goons to find and capture two young thieves who crossed him. The girls, [[Angry and Red]], plan to steal from Corona so they may use the money to pay for travel expenses to escape the Baron's clutches. Unfortunately, Weasel finds them, though Eugene and Lance turn themselves in exchange for the girls' freedom, knowing the Baron would much prefer the heads of his two most hated adversaries. Weasel agrees, but before he can make the delivery, he and his men are defeated by Angry and Red.\n\n===Season two===\nIn \"[[Beyond the Corona Walls]]\", Eugene and his friends make a stop in Vardaros during their travels for resupply. Word of Eugene's arrival quickly reaches the Baron, who orders his goons to capture Eugene so to settle their feud. Eugene, Lance, and [[Shorty]] are taken to the Baron's castle, where the former is interrogated by a bitter Stalyan. She reveals to still have feelings for Eugene, however, prompting the Baron to make a proposition\u2014Eugene must keep to his original promise and marry Stalyan, or he, Lance and Shorty will perish. To get his point across, the Baron unleashes his Kai spider upon Lance and bites him under his clothes. With no other choice, Eugene agrees to marry Stalyan in exchange for the antidote from the Baron as a wedding present.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the wedding is crashed by Eugene's girlfriend, [[Rapunzel]], and her accomplices\u2014[[Adira|one of whom]] manages to free Eugene. Furious, the Baron engages in battle with Eugene and successfully pins the latter down. As the Baron prepares to unleash his Kai spider, Shorty's clumsiness causes the spider to be startled and ends up biting the Baron, instead. Fatally infected with the spider's venom, the Baron desperately searches for the anti-venom, but it had already been stolen by Rapunzel's chameleon, [[Pascal]], and used to cure Lance. The Baron, nevertheless, accepts his oncoming death, and tries to strike Eugene down in vengeance, but is thwarted by Rapunzel. With the battle over, Stalyan tends to her father, vowing to find more anti-venom and settle the score with Eugene afterward.\n\n===Season Three===\nUp to the events of \"[[Flynnpostor]]\", it is revealed that the Baron had become disfigured by the spider venom. He has lost his entire criminal organization, and his daughter has moved on without him. With nothing left to live for, all he wants is to get revenge on Eugene. His attempts are foiled and he is put in jail by Eugene, who became [[Corona]]'s new captain of the guards.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBeyond the Corona Walls 10.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 12.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 60.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 39.jpg\nStalyan and Eugene's Wedding - Beyond the Corona Walls.jpg\nBeyond the Corona Walls (8).jpg\nBeyond the Corona Walls (9).jpg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 64.jpeg|The Baron poisoned by his own spider's venom.\nThe Return of Quaid 9.jpg\nFlynnpostor (23).jpg\n''You're gonna wish he stayed with my Stalyan''.png|\"When all of this is through, [[Rapunzel|you're]] gonna wish he stayed with my Stalyan\"\nFlynnpostor (20).jpg|The Baron's defeat.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The Baron was an unseen character throughout all of Season 1, having only been mentioned by other characters.
