You'll die protecting this world!|Kaecilius|Doctor Strange (film)}}\n\n'''Kaecilius''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears as the main antagonist in the [[2016]] [[Marvel Studios]] film, ''[[Doctor Strange (film)|Doctor Strange]]''. He is a former student of the [[Ancient One]]. However, after becoming disillusioned by her teachings, Kaecilius left the order of the Mystic Arts and founded his own group of [[Zealots]], determined to defeat the Ancient One and bring immortality to the world by bringing the Dark Dimension to Earth.\n\nKaecilius was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.\n\n==Background==\nAfter losing his wife and son, Kaecilius sought out the [[Ancient One]] in Kamar-Taj and joined the Masters of the Mystic Arts. However, after becoming disillusioned by her teachings, Kaecilius left the order and became determined to defeat the Ancient One and bring immortality to the world by bringing [[Dormammu]] of the Dark Dimension to consume Earth. He also founded a band of students who were also disenchanted, called the [[Zealots]], though only one member is known, [[Lucian|Lucian Aster]].\n\n===Personality===\nThe basis of Kaecilius' life and goals was to bring the Dark Dimension to Earth and do what he perceived as saving the world from time and death. Rather than accepting that death was a natural part of life, he cited that time destroyed everything. Despite this, he considered the lives he himself took as meaningless. He was a cruel, bitter, ruthless, obsessed, and nihilistic man driven solely by his goal of creating life without end by surrendering his homeworld to Dormammu. His apathy caused him to have no regard for his fellow [[Zealots]], though he did bother to rescue Blonde Zealot from the desert after she failed him. He was delusional and proud, unable to see that the Ancient One did what was necessary to protect life, instead of just endlessly creating it.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nKaecilius was a stunningly handsome middle-aged man with a tall and muscular build and smooth grey-white long hair. After hailing Dormammu over the stolen book of power, his eyes became disfigured and purple-colored, while a red mark formed in the center of his forehead.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Doctor Strange (film)|Doctor Strange]]''===\n{{Quote|You can't fight the inevitable! It's beautiful...a world beyond time...beyond death...|Kaecilius|Doctor Strange (film)}}\nKaecilius and his [[Zealots]] stole a book of power from the Ancient One, narrowly escaping from her. Inside a church, they hailed [[Dormammu]] and received markings upon their foreheads and deformations around their eyes. With his followers, Kaecilius moved to destroy the three Sanctums keeping Dormammu away from Earth, killing the Ancient One in the process but losing most of his men to her in his efforts.\n\nGoing to the third sanctum in Hong Kong, the Zealots were nearly stopped when newcomer [[Doctor Strange]] used the [[Eye of Agamotto]] to reverse their actions, making them start all over again. Aggravated, Kaecilius and the two female Zealots that had survived the ordeal to this point worked together to send a wave of energy through the city to incapacitate their enemies, leaving no one to oppose the Zealots or to prevent Dormammu's arrival. However, Strange flew into the sky and into the Dark Dimension, where he forced Dormammu into a bargain to take Kaecilius and the female Zealots and never return. Just as Kaecilius and the others realised what was going on, Dormammu turned all three of them into Mindless Ones, to live in utter horrific torment for all eternity.\n\n===[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]===\nKaecilius is set to return.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kaecilius will return in [[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]. This makes him the first villain in the MCU to return in a sequel film, specifically for one superhero (in this case Doctor Strange).\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Promotional===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDoctor Strange - Spanish Poster 5.jpg\nDr. Strange - Textless - Kaecilius.jpg\nDoctor Strange - Blue Poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDoctor Strange 57.jpg\nDoctor-Strange-19.png\nDoctor Strange 55.jpg\nDoctor Strange 103.jpg\nDoctor Strange 102.jpg\nDoctor Strange 106.jpg\nDoctor Strange 53.jpg\nDoctor Strange 52.jpg\nDoctor Strange 114.jpg\nDS HD VFX 13.png|Kaecilius' fate.\n</gallery>\n\n===Behind the scenes===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDoctor Strange BTS Mads Mikkelsen 5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\ndoctor-strange-funko-pop-kaecilius.jpg\nFunko-Dorbz-Doctor-Strange.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Doctor Strange characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
