"'''SAL 3000''' was a supercomputer that acted as the main antagonist in the ''Recess'' episode [[Schoolworld]].\n\nAfter [[Ashley Spinelli|Spinelli]] accidentally destroyed [[Third Street School]]'s clock due to throwing her football at it in irritation at the recess hour prematurely ending, [[Peter Prickly|Principal Prickly]] decided to use the opportunity to install a state-of-the-art computer system that would control various aspects of the school, called SAL 3000, which included a unique bell system as well as keeping time and manning the water fountains, doors, and various other mechanics in the school, as well as keep eye on the children. Although its first day on the job went reasonably well, with the kids liking the computer, in particular [[Gretchen Grundler]], it did have an incident where it locked [[Gus Griswald]] out due to coming out of the bathroom after the bell ending recess rang, thus forcing him to be tardied. Gretchen ultimately defended SAL, with it overhearing Gretchen and thanking it. However, it briefly stuttered when stating Gretchen's last name, implying that it was catastrophically glitched. Ultimately, the second day had it undergoing more severe actions, such as spraying [[Mikey Blumberg]] in the face with water and also causing some mayhem. Eventually, things came to a head when Prickly decided enough was enough and tried to pull the plug, but it was ultimately too late, as SAL rebelled against him and then proceeded to use a facsimile to lure the kids back into the classroom and keep them locked in the classrooms, especially after \"overhearing\" TJ and the others expressing concern about what its up to. While justifying its actions when Gretchen tried to talk sense into it, it also proceeded to call Gretchen dumb, incensing her enough to become determined to shut it down. They ultimately did so via turning off various functions in a sequence, with it ultimately singing \"School Days\" as it was shutting down and Gretchen, in reference to SAL's earlier insult, sarcastically asking in a gloating manner who the dumb one was.\n\n==Trivia==\n*SAL's overall character arc and appearance (such as having a red camera lens) was an obvious reference to [[Wikipedia:HAL 9000|HAL 9000]], much as the episode it hailed from, Schoolworld, was a direct parody of ''[[Wikipedia:2001: A Space Odyssey|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Also, an official character from said franchise is named SAL 9000 from 2010: A Space Odyssey.\n*According to Prickly in the ending of the episode, an upgraded version of SAL existed called the SAL 4000 that came with watches that were wirelessly connected to the mainframe.\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n{{Recess}}"
