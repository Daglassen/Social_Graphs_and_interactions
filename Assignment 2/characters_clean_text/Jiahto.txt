== Biography ==
Jiahto is a Zora historian who studies and preserves the history of Zora's Domain. He can first be found studying the stone monument at the back of the domain. Though he doesn't recognize Link initially, upon realizing his identity, he proclaims that he will never forgive the Hylians for the death of Mipha.
Despite his prior statement, after Divine Beast Vah Ruta has been calmed, Jiahto will admit to Link that he misjudged him. He properly introduces himself to Link and explains that the stone monument at the back of Zora's Domain is degraded and he's worried about the condition of the 10 monuments outside the domain. He wants to put the contents of the monuments into a book, but he's limited by his old age. Agreeing to help him gives Link the "Zora Stone Monuments" Side Quest. When Link returns after reading all the monuments, Jiahto will thank him and reward him with a Diamond.
