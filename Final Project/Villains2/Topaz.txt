She is the personal guard of [[Grandmaster]], acting as his personal assistant. Much like the Grandmaster herself, Topaz is morally ambiguous, but is still loyal to the Grandmaster. \n\nWhile on the service of the Grandmaster, she carries around a staff that can fire energy blasts powerful enough to melt her enemies, something she is often eager to do, much to the Grandmaster's chagrin. Topaz also dislikes [[Valkyrie]], another subordinate of the Grandmaster, for receiving the Grandmaster's favor. After the revolution on [[Sakaar]] begins, Topaz leads the chase after [[Thor Odinson]], [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], and Valkyrie trying to escape in fighter ships. A distraction in the battle disorients her and she perishes when her fighter crashes.\n\n\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Thor characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:What If...? characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Timeline Versions]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
