ultimately crushed Clayton death Hollow Bastion Maleficent and her legion villains discussed the presence the Heartless Deep Jungle due Clayton darkness saying that his darkness was bit too tasty the Heartless for his own good believing the hunter have been weak hearted William Cecil Clayton and Tarzan biological younger cousin the movie had addressed the relationship between these would more likely Tarzan older cousin given his appearance and age between his forties and fifties Although Clayton the main villain doesn appear until thirty minutes into the movie and only has about seven minutes screen time the original script for the film Clayton and Tarzan battle took place the boat and men tried escape Tarzan would end killing Clayton men and confronting the hunter the boat Much like the final cut the film Tarzan spares Clayton but Clayton bounds and attacks the ape man yet again Tarzan would end dodging the bullet literally and throwing knife oil bucket which would leak and blow the boat incinerating the hunter for good This ending was dropped since was too dark and violent for young viewers and was felt was more appropriate have the final fight the jungle could play part Clayton downfall the vine around his neck Another reason for being dropped was because also contradicted Tarzan remark that will not man like him Clayton yet this version Tarzan kills Clayton henchmen and ultimately kills Clayton throwing the knife Clayton trapping him near the oil bucket where dies the explosion They also wanted Clayton appear more animalistic and rely more brute force his battle with Tarzan Hence has lot less dialogue the final version except for his xenophobic remark and lot more violent his attacks This alternate ending can found the Special Edition Disc DVD Clayton another villain who never sings for example Shan Clayton another the Tarzan characters that does not appear House Mouse because the only who appears Tantor Villains"
