"Carnotaurus also known Carnotaurs Meat eating bull were species carnivorous dinosaur that lived the Late Cretaceous period million years ago South America They appear the main antagonists Disney 2000 CGI film Dinosaur Although they serve the film antagonists Carnotaurs are simply carnivores who require meat survive and have real malicious intent Like most natural predators they see prey creatures little more than food Though they have dialogue the film they are not without certain level intelligence they were smart enough follow the herd footprints find food and water The the movie might mated pair perhaps siblings they have very strong bond and the surviving shows powerful grudge against Aladar trying drag him over cliff possibly avenge the death his friend Carnotaurs are extremely vicious dangerous bloodthirsty and feared described mouthful teeth with bad attitude Eema But important note that like most predators they are best picking off weak and solitary prey Their easiest quarry would have been stragglers much smaller creatures even these powerful predators could not contend with entire herd and struggled against strong individuals like Aladar and Bruton The Carnotaurs are fearsome bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs with reddish scales long tails sharp teeth and short horns Their arms are stubby and vestigial the bipedal predators longer require them for locomotion The Carnotaurs that serve the film main antagonists are noticeably different size though unknown whether they are mated pair just relatives Both Carnotaurs are ambiguous regards their genders and never stated whether either male female Carnotaurus first appears the beginning the film where Baby Parasaurolophus young Parasaurolophus chases flying lizard into the jungle The flying lizard eventually landed what appeared the bark large tree The young dinosaur looks where the reptile but before can get close saliva falls the branch next causing the young dinosaur look where the lizard landed the nose carnotaur which quickly awakens The young Parasaurolophus runs out the jungle terror getting the attention many the herbivorous dinosaurs The Carnotaur bursts out the treeline and lunges after the dinosaurs smashing all but Aladar the eggs Iguanodon nest the process Ultimately the chase ends when the Carnotaur runs down and kills unfortunate Pachyrhinosaurus the slowest herbivore the group Like the other dinosaurs the film migration the Carnotaurus have been driven out their usual habitat the meteor strike and pair them have decided follow the herd obtain food the arid landscape Near the middle the film Carnotaurus scare off pack likeminded Velociraptors from the remains Struthiomimus The hunters then continue tracking the herd that Aladar and his lemur family have recently joined

himself having unintentionally led the predators the rest the herd That night the Carnotaurs stop for water before noticing new tracks the distance and resuming their hunt Later Aladar his family friends and Bruton take shelter from rainstorm cave the Carnotaurs inevitably discover them and attack Bruton comes the rescue and sacrifices himself causing cave burying the smaller Carnotaur The larger Carnotaur survives however leaving and roaring vengeance before continuing his search for the herd After Aladar and company find the Nesting Grounds Aladar rushes back warn Kron herd about the rock pile and ravine blocking the main entrance the way there sees dead Stygimoloch and quickly hides when hears the Carnotaur coming eat the Stygimoloch Aladar manages escape shortly after unintentionally drawing the Carnotaur attention The next day Aladar reaches the herd and tries warn Kron about the approaching Carnotaur Kron refuses listen and berates Aladar for leading the carivore them After his battle with Kron Aladar assumes the herd leadership Unfortunately the Carnotaur arrives shortly after and the cornered herd begins panic Aladar orders the herd stand together rather than scatter avoid being picked off Aladar bravely takes the lead confronting the larger predator himself joined Neera and other members the herd soon join The carnotaur finds itself overwhelmed the herd combined might and backs down However spots Kron who has stubbornly scrambled off his own and the hunter chases after him with Neera and Aladar not far behind After Kron climbs the rocks only find himself facing cliff the Carnotaur corners him Kron fights back but the Carnotaur bites him the back and tosses him against rock mortally wounding him about finish him off Neera comes and assaults the Carnotaur attempt save her brother but quickly overpowered The Carnotaur then prepares finish Neera but Aladar arrives and manages push the Carnotaur the edge the cliff the carnotaur faces Aladar its massive weight causes the cliff ledge crumble the ledge starts crack the carnotaur grabs Aladar and tries pull him down along with but fails and the Carnotaur falls off the cliff its death the jagged rocks below The carnotaurus return the main antagonists the video game the movie they are unkillable and can only defeated completing set tasks that lures them into deadly traps the ride DINOSAUR Disney Animal Kingdom Carnotaurus encountered four times addition Carnotaurus sculpture appearing the sign for the attraction and the animal presence can felt early the queue Within the Dino Institute there giant replica Carnotaurus skeleton the centre piece part within the queue likely that this skeleton intended the dinosaur encountered the ride sign underneath the skeleton explains its beefed size and misplaced location through museum sign labeling Floridian subspecies known Robustus Floridaensis The first time the Carnotaurus directly encountered when the Time Rover computer locks onto large dinosaur although not the Iguanodon the dinosaur meant captured When the Time Rover reached the targeted dinosaur the computer identified Carnotaurus roars the riders but they safely get away the second encounter lightning flashes reveal the Carnotaurus runs towards the guests the Time Rover flees After turning left and right many times avoid meteor strikes the Carnotaurus encountered again rearing its full height and roaring loudly Luckily the riders the Time Rover escape The last encounter just seconds before the killer asteroid hits the Earth The Carnotaurus lunges the guests just they make through the present day the asteroid marks the extinction the dinosaurs including the Carnotaurus Dinosaur Carnotaurus was shown much bigger than was real life The film shows big the Tyrannosaurus Rex naming Carnotaur actuality Carnotaurus sastrei was smaller roughly about feet tall and feet long while Tyrannosaurus was feet tall and feet length thus making Carnotaurus slightly larger than Iguanodon the main dinosaur the movie The real life animal was also far lighter build than its movie counterpart having disproportionately long legs meant for high speed running opposed close quarters brawling the film version uses Additionally the arms the film Carnotaurus are longer and more opposable than the arms real Carnotaurus whose arms were barely used all and resembled small hands sticking from their sides According the behind the scenes features the DVD the Carnotaurus least feet tall the movie The skeleton Carnotaurus robustus floridaensis the lobby for the ride Animal Kingdom casting made combining elements cast material from Tyrannosaurus rex and scaled casts actual Carnotaurus sastrei material Another inaccuracy that while the Carnotaurs the movie are very big bulky animals the real life Carnotaurus was very slim animal almost like cheetah with long gracile legs Added this Carnotaurus was also very fast and had thick stiff tail for powering its running abilities such could not use its tail strike another dinosaur the larger Carnotaurus did Aladar the film during their battle This would have also prohibited any pivotal turns The snout the Disney Carnotaurus much more prolonged and broad than the snout the Carnotaurus real life which often compared that bulldog The Carnotaur given much more articulated body the film heavily inspired the rex Contrary popular belief Carnotaurus was not typical theropod dinosaur its family Carnotaurinae developed separately from the group the then isolated South America from different ancestors often put forward scientists have had relatively simply body which would have looked like sausage with long legs and mouth the end Even with the rationalization that the Carnotaurus the attraction Floridian sub species unknown how the Carnotaurus would have come inhabit there The reason behind this because during the Cretaceous Period the continents which would become South America and North America were separated coastal seas and straight the Atlantic Ocean Carnotaurus was naturally indigenous South America tropics with its features such bumpy exposed skin being adapted this tropical ecosystem while what would become Florida was located far the northern hemisphere and completely submerged passage known the Suwannee Straits 2019 Twitter post Joe Rohde has offered the explanation series long since eroded islands within the shallow seas being means for species exchange between the continents though this conceit isn referenced Dinoland propping itself https twitter com Joe_Rohde status 1147704324446814209 The theory that carnotaurus was covered robust crocodile like scales was disputed 2021 upon examination the skin impressions showing that the larger scales would have been randomly distributed with the scales overall resembling more typical avian lizard like scales The tips the Carnotaurus tails are similar those the armadillo lizard During the production both the movie and the ride original plans called for the famous Tyrannosaurus rex but Disney decided incorporate the lesser popular Carnotaurus instead its demonic appearance made fitting for the role the main antagonist and wasn well known animal the time However many fans and viewers often mistake the Carnotaurus portrayed the film rex due their large size They even nearly resemble devil like rex appearance Carnotaurus have many differences from rex such smaller useless arms its obvious horns and shorter snout Ironically though paleontologists credit the abelisaurs the group Carnotaurus belongs being similar tyrannosaurs such Tyrannosaurus dubbing them the rexes the South Hemisphere The canyon scenes were possibly set the Americas because Carnotaurus and several iguanodonts not Iguanodon were discovered Argentina The death spots the abelisaurids were South America and the rest the film most likely takes place North America the nesting grounds Asia the desert and Europe the original nesting ground land The vocal effects were composed Christopher Boyes former colleague and sound engineer Gary Rydstrom For the Carnotaurus the sound designs were based the roars big cats pigs crocodilians etc The second smaller Carnotaurus perhaps the larger mate also possible given their size differences that the larger carnotaur the smaller parent Though according the designer David Krentz they were both always referred since their relationship was not considered Aside from size the Carnotaurus appearance nearly accurate most regards skin impressions are known from Carnotaurus its appearance can shown with relative confidence With that being said however the armor plating also known osteoderms was not spiked instead they were smooth and small Deleted scenes depicting Bruton and his scouts attack the Carnotaurus indicate that there was originally supposed three Carnotaurs instead Original storyboards also indicate that the Carnotaurs were responsible for the deaths the discarded characters that were Noah old name concept for Aladar grandparents The creatures also were originally given much more uncanny role almost dinosaur Grim Reaper some notes saying they almost never vocalize and have habit sneaking characters The Carnotaurus the DINOSAUR ride has Hidden Mickey its forehead when encountered the 1st time The mural the dinosaur the gift shop the end the ride has the dewlap its neck After its appearance DINOSAUR the Carnotaurus would appear other media has also appeared the 2016 animated Universal movie The Land Before Time XIV Journey the Brave well the 2018 live action Universal movie Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom Before this however the dinosaur also appeared Michael Crichton book Jurassic Park The Lost World where they developed the ability turn practically invisible Carnotaurus would also appear the video game adaptions the franchise under the same name The Carnotaurus the latter films look similar the ones Dinosaur The
