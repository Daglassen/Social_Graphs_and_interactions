"'''The Black Cube of Darkness'''\u00a0is a character\u00a0in [[Wander Over Yonder|''Wander Over Yonder'']]''.''{{Infobox_character|image = Black Cube of Sunshine.png|name = The Black Cube of Darkness|shows = [[Wander Over Yonder]]}}\n\n== Background ==\nHe\u00a0first appeared in \"The Fancy Party\". He is a seemingly ominous object who was considered to be concentrated evil and only speaks in Latin with a deep demonic voice. He was formerly one of the most powerful and evil villains in the galaxy and was consistently among the top rankings of the\u00a0Galactic Villain Leaderboard\u00a0with dozens of planets under his control, but eventually gave up villainy after failing to acquire the Ring of Invincibility in a humiliating event. He has since reformed with the aid of\u00a0Wander\u00a0and found a new lease on life.\n\nHe joins Wander and a group of rebels to fight [[Lord Dominator]] at [[The End of the Galaxy]].\n\n== Powers ==\nHis main power is the ability to temporarily suck the soul out of anyone who looks directly at him. When he does this, he can be heard speaking, and visible distortion occurs for those nearby. Victims will become limp, and their pupils grow to cover the whole eye. It appears these effects only last a short amount of time. He is also capable of levitation, which provides his main method of mobility.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Andy Bean is not credited for voicing the Black Cube during the animatics and credits\n* According to\u00a0Francisco Angones, the Black Cube is loosely based on the \"Ultimate Evil\" from the 1997 film\u00a0''The Fifth Element''.\n* It is possible that he knows some English because if you listen carefully when he's battling\u00a0Little Bits, it sounds like he says, \"It's over for you.\"\n\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black Cube of Darkness, The}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
