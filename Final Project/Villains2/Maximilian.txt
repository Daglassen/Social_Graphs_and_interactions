Palomino|Palomino]] arrives at the command tower, Maximilian is the first robot to approach them and almost threatens to eliminate them until Dr. Reinhardt orders him to stand down.\n\nHe assists Captain Holland, Pizer, and V.I.N.CENT require the parts they need to repair their ship but shows no trust toward the visitors, especially when he catches Holland snooping around.\n\nWhen [[Kate McCrae|Kate]] and Alex try to escape after finding out Reinhardt's dark secret, Maximilian engages them and kills Alex much to Reinhardt's disgust.\n\nWhen the [[U.S.S. Cygnus|Cygnus]] is on the edge of destruction, Reinhardt orders him to prepare the Probe Ship but instead goes after the crew of the Palomino, leaving his master pinned down against a huge monitor. He takes them by surprise and shoots [[B.O.B.]]. V.I.N.CENT fights him off while the crew escapes to the Probe Ship. He nearly destroys V.I.N.CENT until he drills through his circuitry and lifelessly gets sucked away into the black hole.\n\nReinhardt and Maximilian are merged together and are last seen standing upon a hellish landscape.\n\n===Personality===\nAlthough he doesn't express what he thinks in words, his sharp stiff body language does the talking. He shows no trust toward strangers especially when they are considered as guests. Even though he is [[Hans Reinhardt|Reinhardt's]] loyal number one, he's also known to be disobedient and will do as he pleases when he kills Dr. Durant or ignores Reinhardt's cry for help.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Basher [[Beetleworx]] takes on the form of Maximilian in [[Tomorrowland|Tomorrow City]] in ''[[Epic Mickey]]''.\n*Maximillian is cited as one of the inspirations for the Omnidroid in ''[[The Incredibles]]'', which was released 25 years later, in [[2004]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nMaximillian_Concept_Sketch_by_Carl_Aldana_05.jpg\nMaximillian_Concept_Sketch_by_George_McGinnis_01.jpg\nMaximillian_Concept_Sketch_by_George_McGinnis_04.jpg\nThe Black Hole 5.jpg|Japanese cutaway\n133b_Cinef_V9_3 n 4_Pg14b_Blk Hole_Max_lg.jpg|Maximilian Clay model quarter inch scale model\n134a_Cinef_V9_3 n 4_Pg33_Blk Hole_m.jpg\n130a_Cinef_V9_3 n 4_1980_Cvr_wide fold_lg.jpg\n133a_Cinef_V9_3 n 4_Pg14_Blk Hole_m.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nCap091.JPG\nCap059.JPG|Maximilian about to kill Alex Durant\nCap041.JPG\nBlack-hole-disneyscreencaps.com-9985.jpg|Maximilian's defeat\nMaximilian-black-hole.jpg\nMaximillian Attacks.jpg\nThe Black Hole 2.jpg|Head to head with V.I.N.CENT\nTumblr n4vgdoshZz1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr n7r42fBjBK1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr neuqrbyfz31qhcrb0o2 1280.jpg\nTumblr ngvgssQQNM1qhcrb0o2 1280.jpg\nMaximillian 1.jpg\nMaximillian 2.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" navigation=\"true\">\nFunko-NYCC-Exclusive-Maximillian-Black-Hole-Pop.jpg\nDisneyRobots.jpg\n54587DC7-ACC2-4762-AA18-0CAD81DA9640.jpeg|The full-size Maximilian filming model as seen in the VIP area of Disney\u2019s MGM Studios (used to be Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop which was part of the original Backstage Studio Tour)|link=https://www.flickr.com/photos/rustyalaska/1951464192/in/album-72157601793775439/\n8467397E-4638-43A6-A31D-6EB5656B5C2A.jpeg|A miniature size Maximilian filming model located in Disneyland Paris\u2019 Planet Hollywood restaurant|link=https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/black-hole-max-pics.33399/\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Black Hole}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Black Hole characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Machines]]"
