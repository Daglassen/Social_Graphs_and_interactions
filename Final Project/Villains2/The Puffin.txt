He is said to have more advantage in the rain which has not been demonstrated yet. His dress and appearance are based on the Penguin from Batman (and a similar parody of him), although characters in the show stop talking before the connection is made and before lawsuits can be filed.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Puffin}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
