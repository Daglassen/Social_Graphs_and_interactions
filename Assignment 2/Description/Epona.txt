Consecutive hits boost your score!|Stage Select|LCT}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n==={{OoT|-}}===\nEpona is first seen when she is just a foal at [[Lon Lon Ranch]] in {{OoT}}, where she is raised by [[Malon]].<ref name=\"Friend\"/> She is wild and untamed, running away when Link approaches, as only Malon can get close to her.<ref>{{Cite|It seems like Epona is afraid of you, fairy boy...|Malon|OoT}}</ref> After Malon teaches Link \"[[Epona's Song]]\",<ref>{{Cite|My mother composed this song. Isn't it nice? Let's sing together.|Malon|OoT}}</ref> Epona stops running away and approaches Link. Malon then says that Epona has taken a liking to him.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, Epona! She's grown fond of you, fairy boy.|Malon|OoT}}</ref>\n\nLink then finds Epona seven years later when she has become a mare. However, things have taken a turn at the Ranch and [[Ingo]] is now in charge. Ingo plans to present Epona to [[Ganondorf]],<ref>{{Cite|Is that Epona? How did you tame that wild horse right under my nose?! I was going to present that horse to the great Ganondorf...|Ingo|OoT}}</ref> who he claims gave him ownership of the Ranch.<ref>{{Cite|There are some people in Kakariko spreading rumors that I cheated Talon out of the ranch, but... Don't be ridiculous! That guy Talon was weak! I, the hard-working Ingo, poured so much energy into this place! I don't want any strangers like you saying anything bad about me! Listen. The great Ganondorf recognized my obvious talents and gave the ranch to me!|Ingo|OoT}}</ref> At first, Epona will run from Link as if he is a stranger, but if he plays \"Epona's Song\", she will remember him and trot to his side. Link can then participate in a horse race against Ingo with Epona as his steed. If Link wins, Ingo will get furious, challenging him again while betting Epona herself on the outcome of the race.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, you!! How about another race! If you win... You can keep...the horse!!|Ingo|OoT}}</ref> If Link wins, Ingo lets him keep Epona. However, Ingo then attempts to prevent Link from leaving with Epona by shutting the gates of the Ranch.<ref>{{Cite|As I promised, I'll give the horse to you... However... I'll never let you leave this ranch!|Ingo|OoT}}</ref> Link can guide Epona to jump over the walls of the Ranch to escape into [[Hyrule Field]]. Afterwards, Link can play \"Epona's Song\" while in Hyrule Field to call her. During the ending credits, Epona is seen running across Hyrule Field, and is later seen next to Malon during the celebration of Ganondorf's defeat at Lon Lon Ranch.\n\nWhile riding Epona, Link cannot get hurt by enemies and can only attack by using the [[Bow]]. He can also whip her to get up to six speed boosts, appearing on-screen as [[Carrot]]s. The boosts can be used to jump over barriers and fences, such as in the aforementioned escape from Lon Lon Ranch after Ingo shuts the gates, and are restored after a few seconds. Epona can be used to jump across the broken bridge in [[Gerudo Valley]] and to play the [[Horseback Archery Range]] minigame in [[Gerudo's Fortress]]. She is also required to summon [[Big Poe]]s in Hyrule Field. Despite this, obtaining Epona is entirely optional, as Link can also cross the broken bridge in Gerudo Valley using the [[Longshot]].\n\n==={{MM|-}}===\nLink is first seen riding Epona through the [[Lost Woods]] at the start of {{MM}}. Epona is then startled by [[Tatl]] and [[Tael]], causing [[Link]] to be thrown to the ground and knocked unconscious. The [[Skull Kid]] wearing {{MM|Object}} then appears and searches Link's body, finding the {{Term|OoT3D|Ocarina of Time (Item)|link}} and taking it.<ref>{{Cite|Ooh, ooh! What a pretty ocarina... Hey, Skull Kid, lemme touch it! I wanna see!|Tael|MM}}</ref> When Link regains consciousness, the Skull Kid attempts to hide the Ocarina, but Link lunges at him in an attempt to get it back. The Skull Kid then leaps out of the way and onto Epona, galloping away on her afterwards. Link leaps after him but only manages to grab onto Skull Kid's leg. Epona continues to gallop along, dragging Link with them until he loses his grip. When Link finally catches up with the Skull Kid again, he tells him that he got rid of Epona because she did not listen to a word he said.<ref>{{Cite|What's with that stupid horse of yours?! It doesn't listen to a word that's said to it... There's no point in riding a thing like that, so I did you a favor and got rid of it... Hee, hee...|Skull Kid|MM}}</ref>\n\nAfter completing the [[Snowhead Temple]], Link finds Epona in [[Romani Ranch]]. If he visits the Ranch on the [[First Day]], [[Romani]] teaches him \"Epona's Song\" and gives Epona back to Link after he practices shooting balloons while riding her.<ref>{{Cite|I'll teach Romani's horse-calling song to you, Grasshopper.|Romani|MM}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Now you two keep getting along, and go practice some more!|Romani|MM}}</ref> Epona is required to enter the [[Great Bay]] and [[Ikana Canyon]] since they are blocked by fences that only she can jump over. During the [[New Day|ending credits]], Link is seen departing from [[Termina]] on Epona.\n\nAs in {{OoT}}, enemies cannot hurt Link while riding on Epona, he can only attack by using his Bow, and he can get up to six speed boosts.\n\n==={{TMC|-}}===\nEpona can be seen in [[Hyrule Town]] carrying a wagon with [[Milk]] containers in {{TMC}}. She is owned by Malon, who sells milk to Link after he helps her and [[Talon]] find the [[Spare Key]] to their farm house. While {{Term|TMC|Minish|link}}-sized, {{Term|TMC|Link}} can communicate with Epona, who asks him to buy some Lon Lon Milk.<ref>{{Cite|Please! Buy Lon Lon Milk from me! If you don't my wagon will be too heavy on the ride home!|Epona|TMC}}</ref> Link can also [[Kinstone Fusion|Fuse]] [[Kinstone]]s with her.\n\n==={{TP|-}}===\nThe name of Link's horse can be chosen in {{TP}}, although the default name is Epona. She is seen and used very early in the game, aiding Link in his job as a rancher in [[Ordon Village]], although [[Ilia]] is the one who takes care of her.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, hi, Link. I washed Epona for you!|Ilia|TP}}</ref> Ilia gets angry when Link treats the horse poorly or she gets hurt.<ref>{{Cite|Wait... What's this? What's happened? She's injured, isn't she? Link? How could you! You were pushing Epona too hard again! I bet you hurt her leg jumping fences, didn't you!|Ilia|TP}}</ref> After the village is attacked by [[King Bulblin]], Epona disappears. However, Link reunites with her later in [[Kakariko Village]], where she runs around desperately attempting to throw off two [[Bulblin]]s. Once the Bulblins are defeated, Link has to tame her and then ride her back to Ordon Village to ask [[Mayor Bo]] how to best the [[Gorons]] of [[Death Mountain]].<ref>{{Cite|Hmm... You're not too shabby a wrangler after all! Won't this make getting back to your town a lot easier? Now go finish your errand so we can get back! Get a move on!|Midna|TP}}</ref> After returning to Kakariko Village, Link and Epona ride together to save [[Colin]] after he is kidnapped and taken into Hyrule Field by King Bulblin.\n\nIn most locations around Hyrule Field, Link can call Epona by blowing a [[Horse Grass]] or the [[Horse Call]], which both play \"Epona's Song\". Unlike in previous games, Link can use various items while riding her, including the [[Sword]]. Additionally, Epona can provide short speed boosts like in {{OoT|-}} and {{MM|-}}, appearing onscreen as spurs instead of Carrots. Epona is used when fighting against [[King Bulblin]] and during the third part of the final battle with Ganondorf. [[Wolf Link]] is able to speak with her, as with other animals.<ref>{{Cite|Even though you change shape, I still understand you.|Epona|TP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Link... Hurry up and return to your true self...|Epona|TP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|If you wish to ride me, return to your true self.|Epona|TP}}</ref>\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\nLink can obtain Epona in {{BotW}} by scanning either the {{SSB|-}} Link or {{TP|-}} Zelda 30th Anniversary Link [[amiibo]]. Unlike other horses in the game, Epona does not need to be tamed and can be immediately mounted. Once registered at a [[Stable]], Epona cannot be obtained more than once through the amiibo, even if deceased as she can be revived by [[Malanya]] if she is registered when she dies. \n\nLike the [[Giant Horse]], her mane cannot be groomed and she receives a special bridle and saddle called Epona Gear.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= CaC|publisher= |page= 161}}</ref>\n\nThough not stated in-game, Epona is the namesake of [[Epona Co.]], a 150 year old company that makes horse goods from horse gear to fine items like brushes and riding wear worn by stable workers.<ref name=\"EponaCo\">{{Cite Book|quote= {{Big|Epona Co.}} An established, all- encompassing horse goods maker with over one hundred and fifty years of experience. Our company name comes from the cultural developments between man and horse born from the beloved partner of a legendary hero, which serves as our motto. We handle everything from saddles and bridles to fine items like brushes and riding wear.|book= CaC|publisher= |page= 337}}</ref> Their company logo can be seen on the hats of Stable workers and the base of the [[Horse]] statue at the [[Sanidin Park Ruins]] indicating they were involved in its construction. As a result, Epona is famous and legendary horse among the stable managers/innkeepers as they recognize her when Link registers her and will force Link to name her Epona as they will not accept any other name.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n{{Ambig|Start}}\n==={{LCT|-}}===\n{{Stub|LCT}}\n{{Ambig|End}}\n\n==={{SSBB|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\nEpona in her {{OoT|-}} incarnation appears as a [[Sticker]] in {{SSBB}}.\n\n====Sticker Information====\n{{SSBSticker|header=yes}}\n{{#section:Sticker|Epona}}\n|}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==={{HW|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\nEpona appears during Link's intro and victory animations in {{HW}}. In the Master Quest DLC pack, she is also a [[Horse (Item)#Epona|weapon]] type for Link, allowing him to ride her in battle. She is very fast and is able to cause damage to enemies while running due to her sheer size. She has a good area of effect attacks, though her large size also makes her easy to be hit. Her second and third weapon tiers are based on her designs from {{TP|-}} and {{OoT|-}}, respectively. Unlike other weapons in the game, Epona's additional tiers are not earned via special requirements, but are instead available right from the start provided they are earned in battle.\n\n<gallery align=\"center\">\nFile:HW Epona Icon.png|Epona\nFile:HW Twilight Epona Icon.png|Twilight Epona\nFile:HW Epona of Time Icon.png|Epona of Time\n</gallery>\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==={{MNPTP|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n[[File:MNPTP Epona Sprite.png|left|50px]]\nThe thirty-first puzzle in the ''Picross'' series and the thirty-ninth puzzle in the ''Mega Picross'' series depict {{Term|MNPTP|Epona}}.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n\n==={{SSB4|3DS|-}}===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\nEpona apppears as a [[Trophy]] in {{SSB4|3DS}}.\n\n====Trophy Information====\n{{SSBTrophy|SSB4|header=yes}}\n{{#section:Trophies in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Epona}}\n|}\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n===''Animal Crossing: New Leaf''===\n{{Noncanon|Start}}\n{{exitstub-nintendo|Nookipedia|Epona|Epona in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf''|more in-depth articles}}\nEpona was added as a villager in the ''{{np|Welcome amiibo|Welcome amiibo}}'' update of ''{{np|Animal Crossing: New Leaf}}'', alongside [[Wolf Link]], [[Ganon]], and [[Medli]]. If the [[Sheik]] [[amiibo]] is scanned into the game, Epona will show up at the campground and can be asked to move into the town. She is a {{np|Horse}} villager that has a {{np|Peppy}} personality, and is thus friendly, talkative, and likes to gossip. Her birthday, November 21, references the Japanese release date of {{OoT|-}}.\n{{Noncanon|End}}\n\n==Development==\nDuring the development of ''{{smw|Super Mario 64}}'', the development team had plans to include a horse, which were later moved to {{OoT|-}}. The developers did not want controls to be difficult, so Epona was made to automatically jump over barriers if she has enough speed. To make the experience more entertaining, the carrot system was established, as well as mounted archery. The developers also wanted to include one-on-one battles and horseback swordplay, though such features did not appear until {{TP|-}}. \n\nThe scene where Epona jumps over the broken bridge in Gerudo Valley was specially requested by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. A similar scene is shown when Epona escapes from Lon Lon Ranch, which had more than one exit, so a cutscene was made for each. The idea of horses and these scenes were inspired by Western movies.<ref name=\"IwataAsks\">{{Cite web|url= http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/zelda-ocarina-of-time/1/4|title= What We Couldn't Do with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|site= Nintendo official website}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/zelda-ocarina-of-time/4/2|title= Everyone Loves Horses|site= Nintendo official website}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Various unnamed horses resembling Epona appear in the opening cinematics of {{OoS}}, {{OoA}}, and {{TWW}}, as well as in [[The Field]] stage from {{FSA}}.\n*During development of {{OoT|-}}, Link would use a whip to control Epona.
