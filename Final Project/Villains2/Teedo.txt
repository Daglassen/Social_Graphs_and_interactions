He lives on the planet of [[Jakku]]. He snags [[BB-8]] and carries him around, until [[Rey]] comes along and frees the droid.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''===\nTeedo is a scavenger on Jakku, riding a luggabeast. He catches a BB-8 unit in his net and plans to sell or use it for parts, but is stopped by fellow scavenger Rey. After a brief argument between the two, Rey frees BB-8 as Teedo rides away, angry.\n\n===''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]''===\nTeedo returns \"[[BB-8 Bandits]]\", this time leading a pack of bandits. Teedo instructs the bandits to attack Rey and try to capture BB-8, but Rey outwits them and escapes on her speeder. Teedo and the other bandits board speeder bikes and chase after her, shooting and trying to stop her. Rey manages to trick the other bandits into crashing their bikes into each other, then leads Teedo to the empty husk of an\u00a0[[Imperial Star Destroyer]]. Teedo shoots her speeder, forcing Rey to stop and confront him. Teedo pulls out a large blaster and takes aim at Rey. However, he is stopped when a junk-eating nightwatcher worm appears and devours his speeder bike, throwing him off. Teedo flees, and Rey and BB-8 make their way to the Niima outpost.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Members of the Teedo species make no distinction between individuals, so all members are called \"Teedo\".\n*Members of the Teedo species are telepathic with other Teedo.\n*Teedo, like the rest of his species, is native to Jakku, speaks a language called Teedospeak, and worships a deity known as\u00a0R'iia.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nThe Force Awakens EW 04.jpg\nBB-8 Bandits 2.png\nStar-Wars-Forces-of-Destiny-2.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SW|url=/databank/teedo|text=Teedo}}\n*{{SWW|Teedo (Niima Outpost)}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Psychics]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Sequel Trilogy characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars: Forces of Destiny characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]"
