He is a calm character, with a seemingly stoic expression, but it hides his determination and meanness. He actually likes his plumbing job and hopes to commit some big crime to retire and dedicate the rest of his life to plumbing just for love to the art. He also likes theather and is a good actor, an ability he uses to cover his crimes.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Piper, Joe}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"
