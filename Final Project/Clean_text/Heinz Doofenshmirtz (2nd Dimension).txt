Another notable difference between Doofenshmirtz and his 1st Dimension counterpart the fact that able recognize Perry the Platypus without his hat something which 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz incapable doing much Doofenshmirtz annoyance Unlike his original self Doofenshmirtz actually also willing eliminate those that pose some significant obstacle his plan least those that disappointed him some way once ordering the beating the 1st Dimension selves Phineas Flynn Phineas and Ferb Fletcher Ferb order successfully expose the 1st Dimension Perry secret identity then ordered the feeding the same Phineas Ferb and Perry along with the 1st Dimension selves Candace and even Doofenshmirtz Goozim Phineas and Ferb for refusing reconstruct the Otherdimensionator Perry for failing leverage against

Phineas albeit with baseball launcher when begins stop his plans but was foiled Perry then attempted eliminate Phineas Ferb and Perry once and for all crushing them with fist from his giant robot shortly afterwards but was interrupted the 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz who tells him stop Despite him being darker and more sinister version the 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz still has his flaws and lighter sides like his 1st Dimension counterpart would burst out into monologues sometimes slips into goofy personality very briefly and act irony would also mindlessly include self destruct devices his Norm bots also appears much more emotionally unstable than his counterpart since became far more evil than him despite only losing toy train even Doofenshmirtz finds this stupid reason evil and brings his far unhappier childhood for comparison Additionally his good side immediately returned when Doofenshmirtz loaned over his own toy train causing him change his mind taking over the 1st Dimension Tri State Area and end his reign the 2nd Dimension Tri State Area ufeff Also spite his evil ways Doofenshmirtz genuinely loves and cares for his wife Charlene who shares much his personality

than day spite having lost his left eye Doof has excellent eye accuracy shown when spotted Phineas trying pull himself destroy his inator and managed stop this perfectly throwing razor disc cut the cord that Phineas was pulling The primary trait that Doofenshmirtz shows his high intelligence For example planted clever ruse turning captive Perry into cyborg lure Phineas and Ferb into trap knowing

overthrown and imprisoned for life extremely skilled robotics was able create and mass produce entire army Norm Bots take over his Tri State Area and enforce his reign well creating satellite that allows him control the Norm Bots during his attempt take over the 1st Dimension Tri State Area His skills robotics has extended the same situation when turned Perry into Platyborg well molding his Tri

then pays visit Doofenshmirtz cell where revealed that his wife Charlene Doofenshmirtz 2nd Dimension Charlene the responsible for capturing the agents and turning them into the cyborgs they are now Candace then swore find Charlene and bring her and coerced Doofenshmirtz into helping her threatening take his Choo Choo away while can still remain his life prison Having choice Doofenshmirtz leads Candace into Charlene penthouse where revealed that both them pretended divorced for financial advantages such coupon mail tax records junk yard sales and separate vacation trips during Doofenshmirtz reign Also the revealed that the attack the park and the attempted kidnapping Perry were all but diversions trick the Resistance into freeing Heinz With that mind Charlene sets her Animal borgs place her Phineas and Platyborg prisoners allowing Doofenshmirtz free Charlene also annoyed having her husband focusing his attention his silly toy train she just throws away resulting Doofenshmirtz back his evil ways Following battle between the animal cyborgs and the arriving Resistance members which end with almost all animal cyborgs being freed their evil programming Candace about take both Doofenshmirtz and Charlene into custody only interrupted the couple daughter Vanessa 2nd Dimension Vanessa After brief moment reconciliation Vanessa suddenly aids both her parents and Pandaborg escape having her boyfriend Tony Marzulo drive them away hover car the notorious Doofenshmirtz family escape from the Resistance Doofenshmirtz recognizes Tony the boy whom banished earlier because his interest towards Vanessa Perry The Platyborg Doofenshmirtz second command and Norm Bot army general whom often issues commands They may have possibly been rivals the past while Perry had supposedly been agent before was captured and converted into the evil half cyborg hybrid now Eventually the end after Doofenshmirtz arrested Perry relieved his evil programming and goes back being Phineas and Ferb pet and Doofenshmirtz nemesis When and the 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz meet they initially befriend each other and team capture Perry then force his owners into reconstructing the Otherdimensionator However soon realizes that the 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz incompetent being evil and annoying betrays him and attempts feed him his pet Goozim along with Perry Phineas Flynn Phineas Ferb Fletcher Ferb and Candace but fails when Candace reveals herself the Goozim room and they all manage escape When the 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz hands over the toy train had child which alike that his 2nd dimension counterpart which had been lost called Choo Choo has massive change heart and makes with his 1st Dimension counterpart There appears mutual forgiveness between the after that but can certain Doofenshmirtz considered Candace arch nemesis Ever since Doofenshmirtz has took over the Tri State Area and ruled with iron fist for five years Candace felt that has become personal threat herself and her family and she became bent putting end his reign once for all This was evident when she told the 1st Dimension Candace going DOWN DOWN DOWN Her feud against Doofenshmirtz mirrors those the relationship between the 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz and Perry but despite her determination Doofenshmirtz managed maintain his rule until his defeat Doofenshmirtz and Candace are very cold and merciless towards each other time Candace threatened take away Doof toy train while can remain prison for life refuses help her catch his wife Charlene another time when Doofenshmirtz witnessed Candace destroying his Norm Bots the doom arena furiously ordered more Norm Bots get that banshee screaming girl and lock her cell After Doofenshmirtz was finally defeated Candace felt happy that finally brought justice However months she angered witness Doofenshmirtz and his family escaping from custody she even tried blow their hovercar stop them from escaping but was too late Similar Heinz and Charlene both Heinz and Charlene are seemingly divorced this dimension However revealed that the still love each other and have actually pretended divorced for financial advantages such tax papers and discount coupons during Heinz reign the Tri State Area addition this Charlene shown very evil Heinz she turned several agents into cyborgs similar how Heinz turned Perry into Platyborg Despite their strong and faithful relationship Charlene seems annoyed over her husband cowardice and obsession over his toy train the end they both escape along with Vanessa and Pandaborg from the Resistance thanks Vanessa boyfriend Tony Marzulo Vanessa Heinz and Charlene teenage daughter Her relationship with her father appears strained she angrily reprimanded him for banishing every boy who asked her out most recently her current boyfriend Tony Marzulo and telling him she might not lead social life this keeps which makes nonchalant reply Heinz also admits that very disappointed the fact that Vanessa doesn want show any interest doing evil spite this Heinz still remains civilized with Vanessa doesn mind letting her take his blimp leave for Charlene saying Tell your mother you had fun though even entrusted Vanessa custody Charlene case would overthrown and imprisoned for life which may imply that still cares for her similar fashion Vanessa manages help both her father and mother well Pandaborg escape from Resistance custody having Tony drive them away hover car after tricking Candace into letting her have moment with them This would indicate that Vanessa may evil despite her lack interest and that she still loves her father similar the relationship between Heinz and Vanessa considered irony that this Doofenshmirtz never went through any the 1st Dimension Doofenshmirtz unfortunate childhood events such being forced dress lawn gnome being disowned his parents and being raised ocelots etc and that only took the loss his toy train reshape him into the villain now the lyrics Kick Notch shows that Doofenshmirtz able find least rhymes for evil upheaval and medieval unlike his 1st Dimension self who made many failed attempts while writing down his own evil jingle Does This Duckbill Make Look Fat likes sing like his 1st Dimension counterpart and eat muffins His second favorite game backgammon The magazine confirms that received his scar from Perry who smacked him across the patch with his mace arm while saluting him Him and Derek Milo Murphy Law Derek are the only characters the Phineas and Ferb Milo Murphy Law Universe that have successfully taken over Danville However Aloyse von Roddenstein and Rodrigo very close too taking over Danville but were stopped before they could successfully take the town over"
