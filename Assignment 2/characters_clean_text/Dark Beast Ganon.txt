Hatred and Malice Incarnate: Dark Beast Ganon is the final boss of Breath of the Wild. He is a gigantic, porcine beast covered by Malice and is the purest form of Ganon's rage. Dark Beast Ganon is fought in Hyrule Field after Link defeats Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle's Astral Observatory. Following his defeat, Calamity Ganon flees to Hyrule Field where he sheds his mortal form and abandons his attempt to reincarnate as Calamity Ganon in exchange for power, drawing from all of his Malice. Princess Zelda transports Link beside his Horse to engage Dark Beast Ganon in combat, offering up the only unbreakable weapon to repel him, the Bow of Light. Despite this, it is possible to damage Ganon with the Twilight Bow, Ancient Arrows, or from Sword Beams from the Master Sword.
After the battle begins, Dark Beast Ganon will fire a beam of dark energy from his mouth towards Link, dealing 72 base damage. Princess Zelda will warn Link that the Malice encasing Dark Beast Ganon's body renders any attacks on him useless, so she plans to use her power to hold the Malice back, opening parts of Ganon's body to attack. She does so by manifesting various sigils of light on numerous spots of Dark Beast Ganon's body, encouraging Link to attack when she does so and reporting successful hits. These sigils initially appear on Ganon's shoulder, ribs and thigh on either side of his body. If Link takes too long, Princess Zelda will be unable to hold back the Malice and the magical circles will disappear until she regains enough strength to try again.

After Link has successfully struck Dark Beast Ganon six times, a sigil will appear on Ganon's stomach. When this magical circle has been struck, Dark Beast Ganon will expose the core of his being: a gigantic eyeball located on his nape. During this period, the sky will turn red, akin to a Blood Moon. To reach his core, Link must use the updrafts created by Ganon's dark energy beams to become level with it. As Link draws the Bow of Light, Princess Zelda will urge Link to deliver the final blow.
Upon the final blow being delivered, Princess Zelda will escape from Dark Beast Ganon's core and glow with a holy light, stripping Ganon of his corporeal form and returning him to his ethereal state. In his desperation, Ganon attempts to attack Princess Zelda, only to be driven back and engulfed by a sphere of golden light that destroys him.
