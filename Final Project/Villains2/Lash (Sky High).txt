He is one of the school's bullies, and later an servant of [[Royal Pain]].\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nLash is a condescending, arrogant, narcissistic bully, much like his friends: Speed and Penny.\n\n===Powers===\n*'''Elasticity:''' Lash has the power to extend and contract his body and its parts to great lengths. He was able to use his elasticity to convert himself into the equivalent of a giant slingshot. Lash likes to use his ability to stir up trouble, such as tripping [[Will Stronghold]] in the cafeteria to provoke a fight with [[Warren Peace]], ups a cup of ginger ale at the Homecoming dance, and snatches [[Ron Wilson]]'s cap.\n\n==Role in the film==\nLash and Speed first appear outside of Sky High as seniors, and approach the freshmen asking for a nonexistent student fee of twenty dollars. Ethan, however, realizes they are lying, and they are dismissed by Student Body President [[Gwen Grayson]] (who they have, or soon will, form an alliance with).\n\nLash and Speed take their bus driver's hat until they are confronted by Will Stronghold. Deciding it not worth the trouble, they head off. That day, during lunch, Lash sees Will is near [[Warren Peace]] and trips him, emptying the sidekick's tray contents onto Peace. While Will is fighting Warren in the school cafeteria as a result, Lash trips him again.\n\nAfter stuffing Ethan and Zach into lockers, the two bullies are intercepted by Will and Layla, who challenge them in a game of Save the Citizen. The two ultimately lose after Will ties Lash to a pole, which Speed is smashed into, stunning him.\n\nAfter Gwen reveals herself as Royal Pain, Lash teams up with Speed and Penny which means they were her servants and they intercept Will and his friends. Hot on Ethan's trail, Lash is caught off guard when his opponent kicks him, dunking his head in a bathroom toilet (and taking revenge).\n\nAt the end, it is revealed that Lash\u00a0and the others are\u00a0in prison. He is seen taking Speed's cap.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nLash 2.jpg\nSpeed and lash sky high.jpg|Speed and Lash\nBehind the scenes 02.png\nSky high oh it is so on.png|Lash and Speed watching Warren fight Will\nWarren about to throw a fireball at lash during save the citizen sky high.png|Warren about to throw a fireball at Lash during Save The Citizen\nLashtiedup.jpg|Lash tied up by Will during the Save the Citizens game at P.E.\nGet ready.png\nGwen's minions ready to fight.png\nSky High-Lash after locker punch.jpeg|Lash tries to punch Ethan, but ends up punching a locker instead.\nLash having his head stuck in a toilet.png|Lash defeated by Ethan after his head trapped in the toilet.\nGwen and her gang in detetion.png\nGwen and her gang's defeat.jpg|Lash imprisoned with the rest of the gang\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sky High}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Lash}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Sky High characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
