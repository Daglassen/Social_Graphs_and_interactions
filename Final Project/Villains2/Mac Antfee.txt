He was the Norrisville Ninja during the 80s, the former instructor of Ninja Camp, and is currently a motivational speaker. He has an obese companion whose belly is used as a gong.\n\n==History==\nWhen Antfee became the Norrisville Ninja during the 1980s, he was probably heroic and courageous, like most others. But after being the Ninja for more than four years, he started to become aggressive and uncaring and began neglecting his sacred duties. This was evidenced in \"[[Stank'd to the Future]]\", where Antfee imprisoned [[Dickie]] in a freezer (instead of removing the [[Stank]] possessing him) just so he could have fun at the prom.\n\nSometime prior to the events of the episode \"[[Ninja Camp]]\", the [[NinjaNomicon]] removed Antfee from his status as the Ninja, confiscating the [[Ninja Mask]] and the suit along with it. Antfee was incensed at this, and vowed to someday reclaim the mask so he could \"kick every butt in Norrisville\". Since Antfee exited the book without being mind-wiped, the memories of his time as the Ninja left him crazed and corrupt. Before long, he established his own dojo and training facility so he could recruit his own army and get back at those he believed had ruined his life.\n\nAs a teacher, he was very ambitious, conceited, and determined, always aiming to be the best, and considering those who helped other people to be \"losers\" and \"nicewads\". Antfee showed no mercy to anyone and would convince his fellow students that he was the one true Norrisville Ninja. Antfee even trained his followers to have a hatred for the Ninja and help reclaim the Ninja Mask in order for him to become unstoppable and wreak vengeance. Antfee's desire for the mask was so extreme, he would even resort to threatening ways (such as holding the Ninja's friend hostage) in order to get his hands on it.\n\nIn \"[[Enter the Nomicon]] he become as a motivational speaker at [[Norrisville High]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name shows a lot of similarity with the name of Anti-Virus scanner [[wikipedia:McAfee VirusScan|McAfee]].\n*Mac Antfee appears briefly in \"Stank'd to the Future\" when the Nomicon is explaining to Randy about Dickie.\n*He is revealed to be the Ninja of 1985.\n*According to himself in \"Enter the Nomicon\", Mac was the Ninja for six years, an unusual amount of time for a student to be the Ninja.\n*Since he says to Randy, \"There's no shame in losing to the Class of 85, because we rock!\" he almost certainly graduated in that year. He would, at any rate, presumably have to be at least a junior to attend the 1985 Prom. Assuming that he remained the Ninja for two extra years because he had to repeat one or more grades in high school, he probably entered Norrisville High in late [[1979]].\n*He is an expy of John Kreese from ''The Karate Kid''.\n*He is also similar to Rex from ''Napoleon Dynamite''.\n*He did find out that Randy is the ninja in \"Enter the Nomicon\", but he forgets it after being mind-wiped.\n*He might have known McFist, who also went to Norrisville High in 1985, but their relationship is unknown.\n*As of \"Enter the Nomicon,\" Mac Antfee is now permanently good.\n*He is seen briefly in \"Swampy Seconds\" in an Ace card when the Nomicon warns Randy that \"if he abuses his ninja powers, he will lose them.\"\n*He is the first villain in the whole series to reform.\n*His sword, which he used in \"Ninja Camp,\" seems to be a replica of the Ninja's.\n**Also, the book he used for the Mac Antfee Loyalty Oath has a similar design to the NinjaNomicon's.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nNinja Antfee.jpg\nMac antfee intro.jpg\nNinjaCamp - 64.jpg\nNinjaCamp - 65.jpg\nMac Antfee 85.jpg\nMac Antfee Doodle 001.jpg\nRandy n mac both.jpg\nRandy greets Antfee.jpg\nNinja Camp - Mac and Randy.png\nNotevencloseMac.jpg\nMac beats dummy.jpg\nMac n Man Gong.jpg\nMac n Man Gong 02.jpg\nWhat was that Mac.jpg\nNinja Camp - Randy and Mac.png\nXcept U Randy.jpg\nMac Antfee Doodle 002.jpg\nMac Antfee Doodle 003.jpg|Mac has the mask confiscated.\nMac Antfee Doodle 004.jpg\nNinjaCamp - 502.jpg|\"Someday, I'll get that mask back!\"\nVengeful Antfee.jpg|\"And when I do, I'll kick every butt in Norrisville!\"\nMac Antfee Oath.jpg\nNinja Camp - Mac Antfee.png\nU betrayed me macolyte.jpg\nNinja Camp - Mac and Howard.png\nNinjaCamp - 604.jpg\nMac Antfee speedboat.jpg\nXplosion Antfee.jpg\nMac Antfee Batman Circle.png\nEnterNomicon - 113.jpg\nEnterNomicon - 132.jpg\nEnter the Nomicon - Randy, Howard and Mac Antfee.png\nGet over here U 2 mac.jpg\nMac break a sweat.jpg\nMac nailgnaw.jpg\nWanna know the dilly.jpg|\"You wanna know the dilly?\"\nMac antfee laugh.jpg\nHeres the dilly.jpg|\"Here's the dilly.\"\nEnterNomicon - 262.jpg|\"Now that I know who you are...\"\nEnterNomicon - 263.jpg|\"...I will ''never'' stop coming after you.\"\nSavalotoftrubel.jpg|\"So save yourself a lot of trouble...\"\nIntimidating Mac closeup.jpg|\"...AND GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!!!\"\nMac smash heid shock.jpg\nMac camera stomp.jpg|Mac stomps on the camera.\nEnterNomicon - 351.jpg\nMac unconscious.jpg\nRandy in Enter the Nomicon 1.png\nRandy in Enter the Nomicon 3.png\nRandy in Enter the Nomicon 4.png\nDoodle Armor Antfee.jpg|\"Anything is possible\"\nEnterNomicon - Hydro Hand.jpg|\"Ninja Hydro Hand\"\nEnterNomicon - 523.jpg|\"I was the Ninja for five years!\"\nEnterNomicon - 530.jpg|\"All right.
