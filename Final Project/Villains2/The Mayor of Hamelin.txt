When the incensed Piper threatens to lead the children of Hamelin away in retaliation, the Mayor dares him to \"blow your pipe until you burst\" as the townsfolk had locked the gateway after the rats left. \u00a0However, the Piper not only charms the children into following him, but enchants the town gate into ripping itself open and allowing the children to leave. \u00a0As the Piper leads the children of Hamelin into the hills, the Mayor is left to face the wrath of the angry townsfolk for the loss of their children, much to his horror.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nIn this show, the Mayor of Hamelin is replaced by The Sherif of Hamelin portrayed by Doug Abrahams and appears in the third season, worried by the disappearance of the children caused by [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSheriff 304.png\nMayorofhamelin.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mayor of Hamelin, The}}\n\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]"
