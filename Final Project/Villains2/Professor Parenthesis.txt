Files]].\" He is an evil flea scientist bent on taking over O.W.C.A. with his own army of Mecha-Fleas to take control of all of O.W.C.A.'s agents to do his bidding for him. Unlike most evil-doers who are dealt with by the agents, he is clearly a more intelligent and dangerous villain, always putting on a few tricks up his sleeve.\n\nHe has a habit of mispronouncing words by putting emphasis on the wrong syllables.\n==Appearance==\nIn his usual human appearance, Parenthesis has tan skin, blue eyes, and light yellow hair pointing upon his forehead. His head resembles that of a round bracket, hence his name. He wears a white lab coat with two light-green shoulder pads, green shorts, and pink slippers.\n\nHowever, this appearance was nothing more than an android to conceal his true appearance: that of a tiny blue four-armed flea wearing a white shirt and pink slippers. Parenthesis' android is also capable of procuring four mechanical tentacles as back-up weapons and a giant LCD screen to show his true face to his enemies.\n== Referances ==\n<references>\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
