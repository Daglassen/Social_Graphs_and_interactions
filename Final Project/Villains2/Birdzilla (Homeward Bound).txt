''\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey]]''===\nBirdzilla was the name that [[Chance]] gave to a turkey on [[Kate (Homeward Bound)|Kate]]'s farm after he encounters it at the chicken coop. The turkey intimidates him and forces him to flee in terror. Birdzilla is also what leads to [[Chance]] to change his mind after choosing to stay regarding escaping Kate's farm with [[Shadow]] and [[Sassy]] to return to the Seavers' home. Birdzilla was not seen afterward, but had probably been returned to the chicken coop by Kate's friend Frank.\n\nGoing by its actions during its appearances (including attempting to pursue Chance while he attempted to escape), Birdzilla is extremely territorial.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Birdzilla is a portemantau of \"Bird\" and \"[[wikipedia:Godzilla|Godzilla]].\"\n*Ironically, considering Birdzilla's species, Chance is shown to love turkey at the beginning and end of the film.\n\n{{Homeward Bound}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Turkeys]]\n[[Category:Homeward Bound characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
