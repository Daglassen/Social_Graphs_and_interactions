He was bought by [[Fat Cat]], in order to take part in his plan to seize all of the fish in town.\n\n==Role in the episode==\nJuice-Lee is a master fighting fish who lives in Chinatown. [[Fat Cat]] and [[Fat Cat's Gang|his gang]] go to show the Siamese Twins the ruby and he wants to use Juice-Lee for his master plan. Mole is unsure about Juice-Lee's fighting skills and the twins call for a test to see how well Lee is at fighting. Everyone sees that he can attack some piranhas and Fat Cat is satisfied and takes him.\n\nFat Cat and his gang bring Juice-Lee to a large cargo boat and use him to get rid of the nearby sailors. As the sun rises, Fat Cat sends Lee to punch holes on other boats so that his gang can steal the fish some fishermen captured.\n\nJuice Lee then sees [[Chip and Dale|the two chipmunks]], [[Monterey Jack]], and [[Zipper]] heading to the cargo boat using a ship in a bottle and follows them there. When the gang climbs on an anchor, Lee breaks it in half so Chip and Dale can fall off. He chases the chipmunks until he gets sucked into a pipe. He later flies out of the boat and lands in a glass of water with teeth inside.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Juice-Lee was based on and named after the Hong Kong American martial artist actor, [[wikipedia:Bruce Lee|Bruce Lee]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nJuice-Leedefeat.png|Juice-Lee's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
