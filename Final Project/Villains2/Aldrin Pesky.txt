"[[File:Aldrin_Pesky.png|thumb|250px]]\n'''Aldrin Jace Pesky''' ([[David Kaufman]]) is Maggie's 15-year-old older brother, from the show ''[[The Buzz on Maggie]]''. It appears that he is well-liked at school and is a star athlete.\n\n==Life style==\n===Occupations===\nAldrin works part-time at a local fast food restaurant called Buzz Burger.\n\n===Personality===\nAs the star jock in many sports, but mostly in football, he sometimes becomes vain and selfish. But as he points out to Maggie, he has practiced long and hard to earn this fame, while she is always cutting corners on the road to success. Of his siblings, he seems to tolerate Bella the most and was visibly upset when she went missing.\n\nHis name is a reference to Buzz Aldrin, an astronaut. Like Maggie, Aldrin is selfish and only thinks about himself and what he wants but not like her, he cares about his family and friends.\n\n===Popularity===\nAldrin is the most popular boy at Buzzdale Academy. He plays in the football team and is the best player there, along with George. All the other players are very unpopular.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Maggie Pesky===\nAldrin and Maggie's rivalry seems to stem from early childhood, when Maggie replaced Aldrin as uncle Zeb's \"favorite\" child and no amount of effort on Aldrin's part could win back that coveted position.\n\n===Pupert Pesky===\nIn addition to squabbling and competing with his sister, Aldrin often bullies his younger brother Pupert. However he views Pupert as far less of a threat than Maggie, and will sometimes team up with him to outsmart Maggie.\n\n===George===\nGeorge and Aldrin are best friends. They are both in Buzzdale's Football Team.\n\n===Principal Peststrip===\nPeststrip adores Aldrin, without him, they would never win the football championship. When Aldrin got hurt and couldn't play, Peststrip was furious and pointed out Maggie as the scapegoat.\n\n{{Buzz on Maggie}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pesky, Aldrin}}\n[[Category:The Buzz on Maggie characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]"
