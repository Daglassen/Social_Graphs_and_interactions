Dorrah is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Dorrah is a Gerudo soldier who guards the front entrance of Gerudo Town with her fellow guard, Merina. She wields a Gerudo Spear When Link tries to enter Gerudo Town without a disguise, the guards will stop him. Dorrah will tell him that no "voe" are allowed in Town. She apologizes if Link speaks to her and says that it is a strict tradition that "voe" are not permitted into the Town, suggesting that Link instead go to the Kara Kara Bazaar if he needs to prepare for a journey.
When Link mishears "voe" as "boe," Dorrah corrects him, explaining that "voe" means "man" in Hylian. Dorrah also explains that the Gerudo word for "woman" is "vai". When Link finishes speaking to Dorrah, she tells him that "Good-bye" is "sav'orq" in Gerudo.
If Link tries to sneak into Gerudo Town without using one of the three entrances or removes any piece of his disguise while in the Town, Dorrah will yell that a man has been detected and commands the soldiers to capture him at once. Link is then thrown out to the front entrance of the Town, where Dorrah points her Gerudo Spear at Link and tells him that men are forbidden by Gerudo law.
Once Link obtains the Gerudo Set, he can speak to Dorrah again. She explains that Gerudo Town is Hyrule's largest trade hub and that only "vai" are permitted to enter. When Link mishears "vai" as "bai," Dorrah corrects him and explains that "vai" means "woman" in Hylian. She also explains that the Gerudo word for "man" is "voe." Dorrah recommends learning the Gerudo language if he plans to stay at Gerudo Town.
After Divine Beast Vah Naboris has been calmed, Dorrah says that Riju has calmed Naboris and, if he's wearing the Gerudo Set, Link can come now relax in Gerudo Town. She expects there to be more traffic in and out of Gerudo Town, which means she'll have to be more diligent to keep men from entering.
