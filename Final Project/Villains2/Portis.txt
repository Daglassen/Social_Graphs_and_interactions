Portis uses a spray formula to turn [[Goofy]] into a werewolf to kidnap neighborhood cats, so with another formula the cats will be turned into leopards, silver foxes, etc, for 120 hours, so Pete and Trudy will sell them at the black market, and shortly after paying, the buyers will find their exotic animals turning back into common cats. This plan is stopped by [[Mickey]] and [[Bruto]], who use their own formula against them.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
