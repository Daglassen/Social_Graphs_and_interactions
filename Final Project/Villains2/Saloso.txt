The sirenas turned the tide and banished them to the shipwrecks of their enemies and kept them away through the coral alarms installed, which produced a debilitating sound for the malandros, throughout their kingdom.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSaloso is a shapeshifter, but his default form is a river dolphin. Like the other malandros, anything he shapeshifts into is usually pink, including non-aquatic creatures such as humans.\n\n==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==\nWhen word got out that the sirena royal family decided to form a peace treaty with the humans, the sirenas' general, Daria, went to Saloso for his help, as they shared a common enemy in humans. Saloso at first denies the offer but changes his mind when Daria cut a deal with the malandros leader: if they helped Daria sabotage the unity pact, they get the coastline north of the city and can leave their dilapidated quarters. Saloso agrees to help Daria as long as she deactivates the coral alarms when they arrive, which she agrees to. After Daria leaves, Saloso orders Torpe to follow Daria to destroy all the deactivated alarms.\n\nOnshore the next day, Daria meets with the malandros and proceeds with the plan. Taking the form of a human, Saloso plants himself on board [[Naomi Turner]]'s ship docked nearby while Torpe turns into a sirena. Once King Pescoro prepares to sign the treaty with [[Princess Elena]], Torpe pretends to be a sirena and sings to Saloso, pretending to be entranced, and accuses the sirena of leading him into danger. Convinced that the sirenas are still vile, the humans prepare to attack the innocent sirenas nearby, canceling the peace treaty. During the dissent, Saloso turns back and infiltrates the palace with the other malandros with no coral alarm to stip them. There, they capture the royal family when they return. Daria furiously confronts Saloso, stating that this wasn't part of their deal. Saloso simply laughs and unabashedly reveals Daria's treachery to the shocked sirenas. Ocho uses his ink to confuse the river dolphins and helps Daria and [[Princess Marisa]] escape, prompting Saloso to send the malandros after them.\n\nMarisa returns with assistance from Elena and her friends. Using the [[Scepter of Light]], Elena tries to restore the coral alarms until Saloso and the other malandros arrive to attack the group. Saloso's minions narrowly incapacitate Elena's friends, but Elena successfully regrows the coral alarm, and it emits a noise that agitates the malandros. Saloso swears his vengeance as he retreats with the other river dolphins.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe Tides of Change 18.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 1.png|Soloso with Daria\nThe Tides of Change 19.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 22.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 24.jpg|Soloso In Human Form.\nThe Tides of Change 27.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 12.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 2.png|Saloso with his right-fin man, Torpe.\nSaloso steals the throne.png|Saloso steals Pescoro's throne\nElena snatched by Saloso.png\nSaloso knocks Elena's scepter away.png|\"So much for that!\"\nSaloso blasted by the alarms.png|Saloso covering his ears when the coral alarms are restored.\nSaloso vows revenge as he and his goons retreat.png|\"This isn't over, sirenas!\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dolphins]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]"
