We'll crank it up to Jacksimum overdrive!|Greg Jack}}\n\nThe '''Mad Jacks''' are a team of extreme operatives who appear in ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]''.\n==Background==\nThe Mad Jacks are a high octane action team for hire, who specialise in carrying out extreme missions. While they have real individual names, they all go by the name \"Jack\". Greg Jack is voiced by [[Rob Riggle]], Jack by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], and Jaq\u2014the only female\u2014by [[Kerri Kenney]].\n\n==Role in the [[Big Hero 6: The Series|series]]==\nThey made their debut appearance in \"[[The Impatient Patient]]\" when [[Obake]] hires them to steal valuable hard drive from [[Alistair Krei]]. During their mission, they are confronted by [[Big Hero 6 (team)|Big Hero 6]] and defeated, mainly due to the power of [[Baymax]]. After several attempts, the Jacks are defeated for good, leaving Krei with the drive. Little did they know that the whole thing was a ruse set up by Obake to get Krei paranoid enough to keep the hard drive to himself instead of having it analysed by his tech security team. The hard drive itself turned out be a bug that Obake could use to hack into Krei's computers once he plugged it in.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*The Mad Jacks have their own (catchy, according to Krei) theme song.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Impatient Patient 10.png\nThe Impatient Patient 27.png\nThe Impatient Patient 28.png\nThe Impatient Patient 29.png|Jaq\nThe Impatient Patient 30.png|Greg Jack\nThe Impatient Patient 31.png|Jack\nThe Impatient Patient 33.png\nThe Impatient Patient 26.png\nMad-Jack Jetpack 1.jpg\nMad-Jack Jetpack 2.jpg\nMad-Jack Jetpack 3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
