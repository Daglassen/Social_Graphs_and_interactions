Leaving the heroes to die, Mozenrath and Sirocco departed for Agrabah where they attacked.\n\nHowever, the heroes escaped and after a lengthy battle, Iago imitated Mozenrath's voice to fool Sirocco (who would literally only obey his master by their voice) and Iago banished the demon to the farthest corner of the earth, under the order to never come back. Fooled into thinking this was Mozenrath's order, Sirocco blew off and was never heard from again.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Jackals]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]"
