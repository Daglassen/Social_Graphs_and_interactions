Mazli is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Mazli guards the entrance to Rito Village. Upon meeting Link, he says that he would like to show him around but now is not a good time. If Link asks where he is, Mazli responds that he is in Rito Village, but they are not in welcoming mood. Mazli tells Link to talk to the Village's inhabbitants to hear all about it. When asked what is going on, Mazli faces the sky toward Divine Beast Vah Medoh, explaining that it showed up a while back and shot down the Rito warriors who flew up to check it out. Although it is said to have once been a divine being that protected the Village, it does not seem very divine to him. Mazli is thankful it only shoots at anything flying high above the Village, but it is still demoralizing for the Rito to have to fly so low to the ground. When Link leaves Mazli says not to let him keep the hero.
After Divine Beast Vah Medoh has been appeased, Mazli asks Link if he has come to see the Divine Beast. Vah Medoh has been perched above the Village and has not moved an inch since it stopped there. Mazli is surprised that the rock up there can support all that weight.
