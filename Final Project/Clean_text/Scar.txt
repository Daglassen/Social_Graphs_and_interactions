his brother Scar infuriatingly used the Roar the Elders eliminate them Due using the Roar the Elders for evil the Great Lions the Past took the Roar away and Scar lost the power completely and descended into depression becoming shriveled and weak early treatment for African centered feature called King the Jungle main point conflict was war between lions and baboons this iteration the story Scar was portrayed baboon and served the leader the baboons Eventually Scar became rogue lion that was out for the throne with the Allen treatment the story well the King the Beasts version Allen and Ron Bass This rendition Scar was closer minion than the true main antagonist being subservient Banagi the leader the Hyena Clan well puppet king and the King the Beasts version was also depicted being bit more honorable compared the final version the character twice angrily denounces the Hyena Clan attempts aiding him when about lose against Mufasa and Simba repeatedly insisting fight his foes alone The filmmakers however felt would more impactful Scar had deeper connection the heroes therefore was rewritten Mufasa envious younger brother Andreas Deja was assigned Scar supervising animator Rather than working Pocahontas Deja chose work King the Jungle due his love for The Jungle Book and Milt Kahl animation Shere Khan Despite this Deja did not study Khal animation when working The Lion King prevent himself from simply copying what was done before instead studied real lions some which were brought into the Disney studio and relied the vocal performance and facial features Jeremy Irons Scar was designed stand out from the other lions and reflect his sinister nature u2014he was given dark fur black mane and his claws are consistently featured opposed the other lions whose claws only appeared during points contention Scar song written Elton John and Tim Rice was originally titled Thanks and was performed after Mufasa death the development the story progressed the filmmakers felt that Scar song was performed too late the film They also wanted use Scar number build his eventual takeover thus was renamed Prepared and featured Scar and his hyenas plotting kill Mufasa and Simba and rule the Pride Lands The Lion King Audio commentary Infamously deleted plot point included Scar exiling Nala from Pride Rock because she ignored his romantic approaches after which she finds Simba alive and well with Timon and Pumbaa This idea was ultimately abandoned presumably because sexual harassment and sexual advances particular was considered improper family movie the time However the stage musical adaptation includes this plot development part director Julie Taymor efforts expand the female characters presence the story Malcolm McDowell and Tim Curry were once considered for the role Scar Jeremy Irons was approached thereafter due his theatre background the filmmakers would have envisioned Scar Shakespearean villain Initially Irons was hesitant voicing role animated feature his career was built dramatic live action roles was swayed after watching test animation matched his voice Irons would give ten and fifteen takes line which would reviewed the directors and editor and chosen from there When came Prepared Irons endured numerous rehearsals and eight hour session studio perform the song the end the session Irons literally blew out his baritone voice specifically with the line You won get sniff without and the rest the song sung Jim Cummings who voiced the hyena Scar known very resentful Mufasa and Simba the latter for essentially ruining any chance him legitimately becoming king His resentment and anger towards Mufasa were strong enough that after usurped Mufasa place the throne murdering him outlawed the very mention Mufasa name whenever was anyone immediate vicinity Scar seems possess somewhat inferiority complex evidenced his sad resignation the fact that was passed over the gene pool regarding brute strength the same time however Scar egotistical and prides himself his intelligence saying far brains got the lion u2019s share and somewhat narcissist the latter trait being especially prevalent when plotting the murder Mufasa after the hyenas failed attempt slaughtering Simba the Elephant Graveyard where mentions that when becomes king they u2019ll see him for the wonder has some peculiar quirks which aware when Simba affectionately states You weird Scar tells Simba You have idea although this specific line was intentional joke referring Reversal Fortune which Jeremy Irons utters the same line Scar heavily sarcastic frequently replying attempts conversation with sarcasm and subtle insults After taking over Pride Rock Scar overall demeanor takes turn for the worse becoming somewhat deluded not self denial believing that still logical ruler despite clear evidence the contrary apparently being unprepared confess even himself that Mufasa was better king finding fault his own leadership such dark parallel Simba Just Can Wait King initial idealism becoming king also proceeds refuse relocating the Pride from Pride Rock despite being confronted with obvious evidence that any surviving animals the region had fled the premises well there being ongoing drought not caring this resulted the kingdom his own death This implied that large part the reason why decided this course action was simply because could give that order king Even when above Mufasa having betrayed murdered and stolen the throne from him remains sensitive his brother mention the only subjects that can flare his temper the mere mention Mufasa threatens Zazu assaults Sarabi and snaps his own hyena minions This indicates that Scar suffers from low self esteem Even position power remains vulnerable bouts indecision and insecurity unable accept criticism and too stubborn take the advice his advisers Scar also hypocrite begs Simba spare his life due their family ties despite the fact that killed his own brother also tells Janja not run like coward ignoring the fact that himself fled from Simba during the battle Pride Rock During his younger years leader his Guard Scar often did patrols his own showing his confidence was also bit naive trusted account rouge that ended double crossing him which ended wounding him the end However proved very tactic with his intentions after turned traitor and slaughtered the stranger revenge spun the narrative around his favor make him the hero the story showing his lust for attention Scar highly smart himself liked boast easily able manipulate situations and conversations his advantage This made for Scar lack physical strength which was further demonstrated his decision subject fully grown Simba court rather than fighting him openly Despite this did not appear mind doing his own hunts evidenced when brought zebra leg for the hyenas and the 2019 remake hunted alongside the hyenas fierce fighter who held his own against the bigger and much younger Simba and came very close having him slaughtered However Scar will not hesitate deceive fight seen when flings embers into Simba eyes temporarily blinding him gain the upper hand Scar was extremely charismatic individual able inspire the hyenas follow his cause and gain fanatical loyalty from Zira and her pride lionesses even death Regarding his treatment Shenzi Banzai and somewhat harsh with them evidenced his berating them regarding their failure kill Simba and Nala even though they only escaped because Mufasa timely arrival and his angrily kicking them out after Banzai made the mistake mentioning Mufasa within earshot could barely tolerate the idea relying idiots like them Worst all when realized that they lied him about Simba fate gives them glance which seemed indicate would deal with them Despite this however seems value them friends evidenced his remark when finds the hyenas waiting for him before realized they overheard his remarks well his attempts owing them apology for falling deaf ears when realized was too late and finally passed Scar also detestable sadist convincing his own nephew was responsible for Mufasa death and then taunting him for further even toys with Zazu when the majordomo tried talking back him Despite his negative traits attempts applaud Zazu sing more bouncy song other than Small World song Small World which apparently finds very exasperating like lot people real life because when Zazu starts sing Scar snaps him telling him stop Anything but that Scar remains conniving and power hungry even after his demise evidently shown his schemes weaken the Lion Guard led his great nephew Kion and has apparently become less forgiving failure the point that Janja fears Scar greatly death still manipulative and u2014in spite his pridefulness u2014knows that his goals cannot accomplished without the assistance the Outlanders prompting him use both intimidation and temptation keep his new lackeys compliant retains his plotting nature though becomes more maniacal gleefully sows dissent panic and unrest the Pride Lands through the work his allies attempts break the Circle Life and even kill massive herds animals order weaken the kingdom once ruled his allies show any sign failure cowardice foolishness weakness Scar will fly into terrible rage His anger only rises when his multiple plots are foiled his grand nephew Kion for whom harbors special hatred the end Scar has concept forgiveness nor compassion towards others caring only for himself and has comprehension family clearly shown when surprised and dumbfounded when Kion forgives him for his crimes and instead calls upon the Great Kings the Past judge Scar rather than eliminating the evil spirit hatred Scar elegant and poised but also unkempt and wild looking also speaks with English accent perhaps the most evidently feline lion the film scraggly and melanistic appearance with sleek black mane tawny fur and distinctive almond shaped neon green eyes has large

Claudius had kind side and genuinely believed that could make the country better place and was highly competent king whereas Scar cared only for himself Like Scar Claudius was cunning intelligent manipulative charismatic and ruthless Unlike the diabolically evil Scar Claudius repented from his wrongdoings and did not reveal the secret truth about his brother murder his family also similar the Shakespearean villain Iago from Othello being sadistic charming smooth talking bitter envious and narcissistic also shares many similarities the title tragic anti hero character Macbeth Although not directly related started out honorable soldier King Duncan Like Scar believed would next line for the throne the king son Malcolm was too young However when became official that Malcolm would take
