Trained in the dark side of the Force, he wields the same model dual-bladed lightsaber as [[The Grand Inquisitor|the Grand Inquisitor]], revealing in the opportunity to destroy Rebels and Force-wielders alike. He was dispatched by [[Darth Vader]] to locate the Ghost crew and [[Ahsoka Tano]] to bring them to Justice.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nIn contrast to the Grand Inquisitor and the Seventh Sister, the Fifth Brother seems merely content to kill any Jedi he found rather than use them for information or traps against the wider rebellion. As a result of this, he is not widely respected by Imperial officials or even his fellow Inquisitors. He is also sadistic, bloodthirsty and brutal, enjoying his occupation as a Jedi hunter and relishing the sport.\n\nThe Fifth Brother is a self-assured individual, confident in his ability to succeed where the rank-and-file Imperials and even his predecessor, the Grand Inquisitor, had met defeat. He is less tactically-minded than the Grand Inquisitor or the Seventh Sister, preferring to eliminate his targets at the first opportunity. He also seems to have a hunter-mentality, stating to his colleague \"the kill is his\" after she prevented him from killing Ezra. He tends to look to the Force more often than the Seventh Sister, sensing his prey and traps. The Fifth Brother is clearly over-confident, often simply walking toward his foe in a battle. Despite this, he is willing to listen to input from his fellow Inquisitors, and even protect them from potential harm. However, he maintains an air of superiority, particularly when his decisions are questioned by his junior partner.\n\nHe is clearly ruthless, as he threatened to cut Sabine's throat to force Ezra to comply with his and his partner's orders, as well as being willing to strike down a shipful of innocent bystanders after capturing a Force-sensitive child.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''[[The Force|Power of the Force]]:''' The Fifth Brother has a very strong connection to the Force, being one of the most powerful Force-users of his time.\n**'''Telekinesis:''' The Fifth Brother can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. His skill with the ability allowed him to take control of several electronic grenades used by Zeb and [[Sabine Wren]], preventing them from detonating long enough to launch them back at the two rebels and incapacitate them with the resulting explosions.\n**'''Force Sense:''' The Fifth Brother can sense another sentient being's emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users.\n**'''Force Jump:''' The Fifth Brother can jump or leap at great distances.\n*'''Advanced Strength:''' The Fifth Brother possesses enough strength to crush a communicator with his hand and effortlessly throw an Ithorian. He was also able to face off against [[Garazeb Orrelios]], a Lasat, on mostly equal grounds.\n\n====Abilities====\n*'''Skilled Lightsaber Duelist:''' The Fifth Brother is a skilled, albeit slightly clumsy lightsaber duelist. His dueling style has little to no technique, consisting mainly of vicious power strikes, and heavy chops, hacks and slashes. Despite this, he is still a formidable opponent, as he was able to overwhelm [[Kanan Jarrus]] with a single power strike. However, his lightsaber combat skills are proven to be inferior to [[Ahsoka Tano]]'s, who was able to outmaneuver and overpower him relatively easily in mere seconds.\n**'''Form V:''' Due to valuing strength-oriented tactics, the Fifth Brother is skilled in Shien/Djem So.\n*'''Expert Hand-To-Hand Combatant:''' The Fifth Brother is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant.\n*'''Skilled Pilot:''' The Fifth Brother is skilled in piloting most types of flying crafts.\n\n===Weapons and Equipment===\n====Lightsaber====\nThe Fifth Brother's valued weapon and possession is his red lightsaber.\n*'''[[Lightsaber|Double-bladed spinning lightsaber]]:''' The Fifth Brother had built a red double-bladed spinning lightsaber. It would remain in the Fifth Brother's possession until it was destroy in his duel against [[Ahsoka Tano]], [[Kanan Jarrus]], and [[Maul]].\n\n==Role in the Series==\nFollowing the death of [[The Grand Inquisitor|the Grand Inquisitor]], [[Darth Vader]] dispatched the Fifth Brother to hunt down the Rebels. While aboard [[Kassius Konstantine|Admiral Konstantine's]] ship, the Imperials detected a power signature coming from an abandoned medical station. While Kallus denied the possibility of Rebels, the Fifth Brother didn't and departed to investigate. He arrived just in time to join the [[Seventh Sister]] in her pursuit of [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Sabine Wren]], and would have killed the young Jedi Padawan had it not been for the Seventh Sister's intervention. At her suggestion, he went after Sabine with a pair of [[ID9 Seeker Droid]]s accompanying him and ambushed her and [[Garazeb Orrelios|Zeb]], capturing the young Mandalorian and left the droids to finish off the Lasat.\n\nRejoining the Seventh Sister after her failed interrogation of Ezra, the Fifth Brother threatened both him and Sabine in an effort to learn the location of the other Rebels. Upon the pair receiving a communication from \"Commander Meiloorun,\" the Inquisitors intimidated them into instructing their colleagues to join them on the station. Upon reaching the appointed docking bay, however, the \"commander\" was revealed to be Zeb, who had escaped the Inquisitors' droids and succeeded in rescuing his friends and escaping, with the Fifth Brother powerless to do anything but deflect blaster shots aimed at him and his fellow Inquisitor.\n\nLater, he and the Seventh Sister are revealed to have become partners. During attempts to abduct Force Sensitive children, they ran into Ezra, Zeb, and Kanan Jarrus. The two Inquisitors easily overwhelmed the trio. Suddenly, Ahsoka Tano appeared. Using everything she learned from Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka easily overwhelmed to two Inquisitors and escaped. To add insult to injury, they found their TIE's destroyed. Suddenly, one of the Seventh Sister's probes appeared and showed a record of Ezra that revealed that the Rebel Network was hiding on Garrel. They take this information to Agent Kallus and Admiral Konstantine. Konstantine is skeptical until Kallus confirmed the lead to be solid. While they ultimately fail to capture the Rebels, they succeed in leaving the Rebel Network with nowhere to hide for a year.\n\nMuch later, it is revealed that the two Inquisitors are the cause of this. When they tracked the Jedi to Lothal, The Inquisitors discover a Jedi Temple. Once inside, they were surrounded by Jedi Sentinels and were shocked to see their late leader. After surviving the encounter, they contact their master who arrives. The Fifth Brother told his master the Jedi were getting stronger and Vader assured him it would be their undoing.\n\nThe Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister were contacted by the [[Eighth Brother]] to [[Malachor]] after he was captured by Kanan and Ahsoka. He and the Sister battle Kanan and Ahsoka but were overpowered when [[Maul]] and Ezra arrive, they continued to battle up to the Malachor Sith Temple. With the Seventh Sister murdered by Maul, the Eighth and Fifth Brother tried to stop Maul, but Ahsoka damaged the Fifth Brother's lightsaber; Maul then stabbed him, putting an end to the Fifth Brother.\n\n==Printed Media==\n===''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith''===\nFifth Brother is revealed to have once been a Jedi in the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith'', which takes place between the events of ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''Star Wars Rebels''. He is, alongside other members of the Inquisitorious such as the Grand Inquisitor, Seventh Sister, Fifth Brother, Sixth Brother and Eighth Brother placed under the tutelage and command of Vader. During a training session, Vader also sliced off Fifth Brother's right hand, leaving him to be fitted with a new cybernetic hand.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''===\nFifth Brother is the assist character for [[Seventh Sister]], available as a Unique card.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Unlike most who embrace the [[The Force|Dark side of the Force]], the Fifth Brother does not have the red-rimmed yellow eyes.\n**He is the third Dark side Force-user who doesn't possess this trait. The first was [[Count Dooku]] and the second was [[Asajj Ventress]].\n*The Fifth Brother has double eyelids; the primary set shuts vertically while the secondary set shuts horizontally.\n*The Fifth Brother's design was inspired by unused artwork generated for ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Fifth Brother|Wookieepedia}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic characters]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:Dark Jedi]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
