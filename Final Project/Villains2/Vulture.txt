However, because his role did not contribute much to the story and also somewhat detracted from that imposing nature of\nMaleficent, he was cut from the final version of the film. Despite this, there was dialogue written for the vulture and some rough sketches for the character.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/03/sleeping-beauty-deleted-vulture/16426505/ USA TODAY: New 'Sleeping Beauty' character discovered]</ref>\n\nAfter the vulture was removed, [[Diablo]] was created to fill the role of Maleficent's pet and confidant.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Sleeping Beauty}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Sleeping Beauty characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
