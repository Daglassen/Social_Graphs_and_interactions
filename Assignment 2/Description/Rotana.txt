I was just poring over some ancient text that I discovered the other day... {{Big|And I've finally decoded it!}}|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> [[Link]] can begin the [[Shrine Quest]], \"[[The Seven Heroines]]\", by speaking to her. If Link speaks to Rotana, he will catch her muttering something about a sandstorm to herself before she turns around and notices Link.<ref>{{Cite|It was over there the whole time? <small>I thought it strange that the sandstorm over there never lifted...</small>|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> When Rotana notices Link, she asks what a \"[[Hylian]] vai\" is doing there.<ref>{{Cite|Mmm... Huh? And what is a Hylian vai like yourself doing here?|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> If Link says he has to go, Rotana becomes upset that he is leaving already and thought he wanted to hear the legend of the [[Seven Heroines]].<ref>{{Cite|Wait, you're leaving already?|Rotana|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Oh. I thought that you came to hear the Legend of the Seven Heroines...|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana mutters that she hoped someone would listen to her because her sister, [[Pearle]], will not.<ref>{{Cite|<small>My sister won't listen to me, so I was hoping someone else would...</small>|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks Rotana what she is doing, she introduces herself and says that she was just analyzing part of an ancient text that she discovered recently.<ref name=\"Archaeologist\"/><ref>{{Cite|Well...part of it, at least. ...But the rest is not far off.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana feels that she can get recognition for this discovery and that Link arriving must be fate.<ref>{{Cite|With this discovery, I'll finally be able to make a name for myself as an archaeologist!|Rotana|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Big|OF COURSE!}} You and I meeting here is no coincidence. I've never been one to question fate.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana offers to share her research with Link if he promises to keep it secret.<ref>{{Cite|I can't explain why...but I trust you for some reason. I'll tell you the details of my research if you can keep a secret.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> If Link says he has to go, Rotana becomes upset, demanding that he listens and tells him about her research anyway.<ref>{{Cite|What? You're joking, right? Look, whenever I talk to my sister about this, she spaces out. I need someone to talk to, so YOU'RE GOING TO LISTEN!|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> If Link instead promises to keep it a secret, she will simply tell him about her research. Rotana tells Link of a temple to the east near the entrance of [[Gerudo Desert]].<ref>{{Cite|There's a temple east of here near the entrance to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo Desert}}.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> She tells Link that the temple is dedicated to giant statues of the seven heroines who once protected the Gerudo people.<ref>{{Cite|It's dedicated to the {{Color|BotW Blue|seven giant statues of the heroines}}, said to be the divine protectors of the Gerudo.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana also tells Link of the ancient scripture that she discovered there, which serves as a clue for the Shine Quest.<ref>{{Cite|It was at this temple that I originally discovered the ancient scripture. It reads: \"When the symbols of the seven find their place, the blessed path will be revealed.\"|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana explains that this was all she has been able to decipher so far.<ref>{{Cite|...That's all I've been able to decipher so far.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> She also explains that people once traveled in search of the heroines' blessing,<ref>{{Cite|It's believed that people once came from around the world in search of the heroines' blessing.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> but no one has ever found it.<ref>{{Cite|But as far as I can tell, no one has found it yet.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about the blessing, Rotana says that she is not sure what it means yet.<ref>{{Cite|I'm not sure what exactly it means, but maybe I'll find out once I've deciphered more of the text.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana then explains that the heroines are said to each hold a different power,<ref>{{Cite|I'm not sure if this is related, but it's said the heroines held powers that were part of a bigger whole.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> which include skill, spirit, endurance, knowledge, flight, motion and gentleness.<ref>{{Cite|Each heroine had a different power: skill, spirit, endurance, knowledge, flight, motion, and gentleness.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana thinks they all look the same,<ref>{{Cite|But they all look the same to me.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> so she is unable to decipher which heroine holds which power without understanding the entire script.<ref>{{Cite|I should understand the entire script before long, but that's only the beginning of my problems.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana is also concerned about the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Naboris|link}} wandering the Desert and hindering her research,<ref>{{Cite|That {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} has been moving around the area, making it harder for me to conduct my research.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> exclaiming that Naboris has \"no respect for academia.\"<ref>{{Cite|That thing has no respect for academia!|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> Rotana also says that she knows the place referenced in the ancient script, but she needs to finish deciphering it.<ref>{{Cite|Well, we know the place it's referring to. I just need to finish deciphering the full text now.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks where the place is, she reiterates that it is near the entrance to the Gerudo Desert, but adds that the nearby sandstorm is a problem.<ref>{{Cite|The temple with the giant statues is {{Color|BotW Red|near the entrance to Gerudo Desert}}, but the sandstorm presents a problem.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> She also mentions that approaching the temple will be difficult with the [[Divine Beast]] around.<ref>{{Cite|And that {{Color|BotW Blue|Divine Beast}} isn't in the most welcoming mood. Approaching the temple will be difficult.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> When Link ends the conversation, Rotana wishes that her sister, Pearle, was more like Link and took interest in her research instead of obsessing over Lady [[Urbosa]].<ref>{{Cite|I wish my sister was more like you. If she'd take more interest in my research, she might learn something useful.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Instead she spends her time obsessing over Lady Urbosa. She won't even give me the time of day.|Rotana|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link speaks to Rotana after completing the \"The Seven Heroines\", she is ecstatic that the [[Korsh O'hu Shrine|Shrine]] that appeared at the temple must be a trial given to her by the Seven Heroines.<ref>{{Cite|Earlier, when I went to investigate the temple, I saw a shrine that wasn't previously there... A new shrine. That can only mean one thing. This must be a trial given to me by the seven heroines!|Rotana|BotW}}</ref> She believes that she will be the star of the archaeological society after she completes the trial.<ref>{{Cite|When I beat it, I'll be the star of the archaeological society!|Rotana|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Rotana Close Up.png|Rotana reading a book in her home\nFile:BotW Rotana.jpg|Rotana telling Link about the Seven Heroines\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo\n |characters= BotW\n}}"
