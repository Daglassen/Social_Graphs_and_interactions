== Biography ==
Uma spends her time during the day sitting on a stool by a large tree outside the local inn. She kindly greets Link and asks if he happens to be a traveler. If Link admits that he is indeed traveling, Uma will be surprised. She states that the village has become lively thanks to the peaceful state of the region. Link can ask her to explain and she will tell him that in earlier years, Hateno was no place for farming. She sadly recounts the devastation of Central Hyrule in the wake of Calamity Ganon.
Speaking to her again allows Link to ask her about a number of topics, which she does not mind answering. Asking about the Calamity pushes Uma to reveal that she was not alive for the event, but was born in an age called the Age of Burning Fields. She explains that in time, the people and plants of Hateno recovered, but that Central Hyrule is still caught in the grips of the Calamity Ganon. She believes that older people may be able to tell Link more.
Bringing up Hyrule Castle allows Uma to tell Link of what the Castle used to be like and how courageous villagers would seek out glory there. Its current state depresses the old woman. 
Uma will relate how Castle Town used to be a bustling wealth of diversity should Link ask about it, which also reminds her to tell the hero how he can find the fallen city on his map. It makes her wonder at the scale of the Calamity's devastation. Whenever she is finished answering a question, Uma will ask if Link would like help with anything else. She will bid him farewell when he decides to leave.
