He is [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]]'s trusted scientist responsible for engineering the dognapping of 98 puppies (excluding Oddball and Domino).\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]===\nBefore the events of the game, it is suggested that Cruella and Professor Farzboom have begun dating, if they are not yet married. They may have also met by Internet dating, as Cruella sometimes refers to Farzboom as her \"''Dot Com Darling''\".\n\nProfessor Farzboom at the start is told by Cruella to initiate Plan B since her robotic toy sales are failing. He sends out an army of the robotic toys to capture puppies and pack them in crates to be taken to the toy factory. He also builds a small helicopter for Cruella which fails to help her attack Oddball and Domino at Big Ben.\n\nAfter Cruella's first defeat at Big Ben, she asks Farzboom if his supergloop formula is ready. He shows a bucket of it stuck to his right hand as he tells her it needs improvement. He then builds her a speedboat armed with a tomato cannon (which he claims to be his best invention ever), but her attack is thwarted by Oddball and Domino a second time.\n\nAfter her humiliating defeat, Farzboom shows his supergloop formula, which he intends to use to coat the captured puppies in his dipping process. Frozen in supergloop, they would make realistic animal toys for Cruella's toyline.\n\nAs Oddball and Domino infiltrate the toy factory, Cruella uses the newly built supergloop cannon and Farzboom activates it. After she falls into a pool of supergloop, the two puppies give the professor a fright and cause him to fall in with Cruella.\n\nEventually the police arrive at the factory and retrieve both Cruella and Farzboom and take them to a prison cell (still covered in supergloop). Much to the woe of Cruella, Farzboom tells her that the supergloop would wear off in 20 years, which is the same amount of time as their prison sentence.\n\n== Personality ==\n\nFarzboom has a cheerful personality and is extremely devoted to Cruella despite her dismissive attitude towards him. Despite his pleasant demeanor, he doesn't have any reservations about Cruella's plans for the puppies.\n\n\nHe appears to be rather sensitive about his name, as, during the instructions for the checkers minigame, he repeatedly asks the player to not make fun of it.\n\n== Notes ==\n* Farzboom's submissive relationship with the bossy Cruella is reminiscent of Cruella's unnamed husband in the novel. Like Cruella's novel husband, he has a meek demeanor and supports Cruella's cruel hobbies.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farzboom, Professor}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
