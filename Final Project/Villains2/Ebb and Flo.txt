They only appear in the episode \"[[Beached]]\".\n\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid: The Series]]''===\nNo sooner than [[King Triton]] beached [[Ariel]] and [[King Triton's Daughters|Arista]] (for arguing) banning them from going to the Carnival of Tides. [[Sebastian]], of course, is then assigned to be their babysitter.        \nThe Gators arrive. Specifically, Flo and Ebb Gator, freshwater thieves. Their target is the royal treasure, left unguarded in the absence of King Triton's [[Trident (The Little Mermaid)|trident]]. Ariel and Arista quickly develop a truce; the Gators are the biggest threat, not each other. If they work together, they can stop the fiends from reaching the royal treasure. Oh, and Sebastian helps too.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Their characterizations as well as their plan to rob Atlantica palace were most likely a reference to Marv and Harry, the two main antagonists from ''[[wikipedia:Home Alone|Home Alone]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Home Alone 2: Lost in New York|Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]''.\n*Because they are actually part of the Alligator and Crocodile family, real Alligators and Crocodiles couldn't really live in Open Oceans. As the TV Show and Film series are set in Denmark, Scandinavia, Alligators and Crocodiles can't reach the destination as it'll be too cold in climate.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFlo Gator.jpg|Flo\nEbb.jpg|Ebb\nbeached4.jpg\nbeached5.jpg\nbeached7.jpg\nbeached85.jpg\nbeached89.jpg\nbeached91.jpg\nbeached101.jpg\nBeached115.jpg\nbeached116.jpg\nbeached120.jpg\nbeached134.jpg\nbeached135.jpg\nEbbFlo.png\nebbflodefeat.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Crocodiles]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian characters]]"
