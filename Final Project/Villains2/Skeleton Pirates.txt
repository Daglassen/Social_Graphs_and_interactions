"[[File:james-giant-peach-disneyscreencaps_com-5693.jpg|Their Pirates' Flag|thumb|250px]]\n\n'''The Skeleton Pirates''' are minor antagonists in\u00a0''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''===\nAfter [[Mr. Centipede]] got caught by the Skeleton Pirate Captain, one of the Skeleton Pirates that was named Paul Bunyan attempted and failed to cut Centipede in half. With help from [[Miss Spider]] and [[James Henry Trotter|James]], Centipede was rescued and they escaped with a compass they needed. Centipede was suddenly pulled back by the Skeleton Pirates, which he bravely fought. It appeared that Centipede got killed, but he actually managed to come out in one piece.\n\nIt is unknown if the Skeleton Pirates are still alive after their battle with Mr. Centipede, James, and Miss Spider.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Skeleton Pirate Captain bears a strong resemblance to [[Jack Skellington]] from ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', due to the interchangeable heads used for Jack Skellington being reused for the Pirate Captain. In fact, when Mr. Centipede encounters him for the first time, he even says \"A skellington?\"\n**Additionally, both ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' and ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' were both directed by [[Henry Selick]] and [[Tim Burton]] had a hand with both of them.\n*One of the pirates is very similar to [[Donald Duck]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\njames-giant-peach-disneyscreencaps_com-5769.jpg|Captain Jack\nSkeleton_Pirate_Captain.png\njames-giant-peach-disneyscreencaps_com-5738.jpg|The Pirate Compass\njames-giant-peach-disneyscreencaps_com-5781.jpg|The Pirate Crew\nScreen Shot 2016-01-24 at 12.27.10 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2016-01-24 at 12.28.10 PM.png|Paul Bunyan as a Viking\nScreen Shot 2016-01-24 at 12.29.23 PM.png|An Eskimo\nScreen Shot 2016-01-24 at 12.30.01 PM.png|Ragetti and Donald Duck\nScreen Shot 2016-01-24 at 12.30.47 PM.png|Jack's parrot\nScreen Shot 2016-01-30 at 11.54.38 PM.png|Models of skeletal Donald Duck and Eskimo in a museum exhibit\n</gallery>\n\n{{James and the Giant Peach}}\n[[Category:James and the Giant Peach characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]"
