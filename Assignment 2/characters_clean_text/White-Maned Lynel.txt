White-Maned Lynels are recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.


== Characteristics ==

White-Maned Lynels are the white and black-colored variant of Lynels. They have been in Hyrule since ancient times and only a few amount of witnesses of this breed survive to tell the tale. Like other Lynels, it will often refrain from attacking for a short period of time after spotting Link, instead opting to stare down its opponent. However, they start their battle by roaring out loudly and slamming its Weapon down to causing a fiery explosion around itself. Being a higher tier variant from the Blue-Maned Lynels, it is known to carry a stronger set of "Savage" Lynel gear, such as a Savage Lynel Sword, Savage Lynel Shield, Savage Lynel Bow, Savage Lynel Spear, and a Savage Lynel Crusher.
In Master Mode, they carry "Mighty" Lynel gear. One also appears on the Great Plateau carrying a Savage Lynel Crusher and Savage Lynel Bow.
