He is the adopted father of [[Mozenrath]] and the former ruler of the Land of the Black Sand.\n\n==History==\nAccording to [[Iago]], Destane was a real hard case and even [[Jafar]] steered well clear of him. Mozenrath took control of the Land of the Black Sand from Destane. Mozenrath also explained that he stole from Destane, his power and his humanity, and turning him into one of his [[Mamluks|undead soldiers]].
