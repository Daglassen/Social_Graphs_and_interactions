Gaddison is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Gaddison is a guard for Zora's Domain who can be found guarding the eastern bridge, wielding a Zora Spear. In her youth, Gaddison was part of the Big Bad Bazz Brigade with Bazz and Rivan. Before the Great Calamity, Link would play with her and her friends.
When Link first approaches Gaddison, she reports that the east gate to Zora's Domain is clear. However, she quickly recognizes Link, calling him a sight for sore eyes. She realizes that Link must be the Hylian that Sidon brought to the Domain.
However, Gaddison notes that Link hasn't changed at all in 100 years, but she dismisses it as she doesn't have time to chat. She's supposed to watching the East Reservoir Lake as part of her job, but asserts that she can talk to Link later.
Once Link has calmed Divine Beast Vah Ruta, Gaddison notices the clear sky wonders whether Sidon managed to stop the Divine Beast. She is still wary of the water level of the Reservoir, even after Ruta has stopped spouting water. She shares some of the history of Vah Ruta, such as Mipha piloting it 100 years ago, and wonders if Seggin managed to fire Shock Arrows at it.
Gaddison is seen in the crowd of Zora who watch as King Dorephan praises Link. She is grateful for all that Link has done, as she can return to her work and the Domain can receive tourists again.
During the "From the Ground Up" Side Quest, Gaddison can be asked to move to Tarrey Town due to her name ending in "-son". However, she will refuse Link's request. After Kapson has left, Gaddison will inform Link that he was heading to Akkala. She offers Link a shortcut to Akkala by climbing the waterfalls of Mikau Lake and Lulu Lake. However, she's concerned for Kapson to be crossing the mountains at his age.
