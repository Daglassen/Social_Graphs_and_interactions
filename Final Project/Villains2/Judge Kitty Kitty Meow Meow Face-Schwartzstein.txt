He states that if\u00a0Mabel wins the case, Dipper will be banished from Mabeland and replaced with\u00a0Dippy Fresh, and if Dipper wins,\u00a0Mabel will return with him to the real world. He starts off by introducing the case, before getting distracted by some yarn.\u00a0Xyler and Craz\u00a0then take their positions as Mabel's defense team for the majority of the case. Dipper offers to present his case, to which he is asked by Kitty Kitty if he even has a case. Dipper calls Mabel as a witness, and the judge allows it due to his curiosity. After Dipper presents his case, he attempts to call order, but he is not heard because his hammer is squeaky. After Mabel agrees to return to reality, he gets angry. Mabel attempts to calm him down, but is unable to do so due to her powers being stripped from her. The Judge then changes into his \"true form\" and chases the Pines twins, along with\u00a0Soos\u00a0and\u00a0Wendy.\n\nWhen Mabel destroys the bubble, Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Schwartzstein and the rest of Mabeland residents are then destroyed along with it.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nWeirdmageddon-2-B.jpeg\nS2e19_pink_cat_true_form_gross.jpg|Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Schwartzstein's true form\n</gallery>\n\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
