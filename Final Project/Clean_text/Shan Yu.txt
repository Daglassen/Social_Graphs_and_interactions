the message heavily implying that the archer killed the other also shown merciless even defenseless individuals evidenced his murderous smirk when suggests that return lost doll its owner well being implied have killed the owner the doll well her entire village His penchant for brutality was such that the Emperor China immediately took the matter seriously soon learned that Shan was leading the invasion and the captured scouts fearfully recognized him when they were brought before him Despite his brutality probably because respected leader his Hun army seems kept together out loyalty him rather than out fear him This exemplified his Elite Huns who are able speak him equal terms Mulan Shan Destroys the Village deleted scene showing his massacre the village onscreen however makes clear that not above slaying even members his own army should they show any degree weakness battle particular showing mercy towards any living thing though does acknowledge all life deserves free also makes clear that freedom has its price after subtly ordering Hayabusa attack the freed bird also shown never ill treat abuse Hayabusa his pet falcon meaning may care and have attachment him the same deleted

mountains and avoid the enemy entirely and his men were revealed have managed completely wipe out the entire Vanguard presumably without any significant casualties his end this confidence may have been perfectly justified Even after being buried under avalanche took stride outside letting out loud yell and simply improvised using his deceased status and decreased army infiltrate the palace Shan was also true leader never sends henchmen his work but fights alongside them and even takes the lead when and his army were about attack Shang squad charged first Shan also notable for being the

presence nearby Imperial Scouts and stopped immediately ordering his men root them out Pathological Indomitable Will Shan possesses obliviousness danger that makes him invulnerable fear and

there razed city battled the entire Chinese army and possibly murdered General sent his entire army after Shang and infiltrated the Palace all without any fear failing dying his attempts Even when disarmed his sword Mulan and learning that Mushu not only has massive rocket aimed him but had just lit nonetheless makes final attempt killing Mulan bare handed without any trace fear holding him

sword Mushu launches the rocket lit Cri Kee that slams into Shan and propels him into tower full fireworks killing him the explosion Despite Shan not making full appearance the second film due having been killed Mushu alludes his demise least once House Mouse Shan makes several minor cameo appearances His most notable Gone Goofy where Jafar and Hades are seen talking with Mortimer Mouse and making bets When Mickey Mouse Mickey announced that was quitting Mortimer told the other villains that knew that Mickey wouldn last and pay The Mouse Who Came Dinner Shan was among the villains that Daisy Duck told leave their table because was reserved for someone very important the Niki Caro remake replaced similar but nonetheless different character named u00f6ri Khan and played Jason Scott Lee While similarly ruthless and barbaric here the warrior leader the Rourans who intent avenging his father death Conversely however more misogynistic than Shan evidenced his lack acknowledging Mulan warrior simply calling her girl and his mistreatment Xianniang witch recruited into his army and who the primary reason his forces have advantage for while she also replaces the role his falcon Hayabusa from the original movie Ultimately was killed his own arrow when Mulan redirected back him after tried shoot the Emperor with Shan appears the China Pavilion Epcot where tries kill Finn and Charlene appears working independently from the Overtakers Shan appears enemy the Shoot game When appears level will ride horizontally across the screen his horse until reaches the other side the screen will make more Huns appear below him make more difficult for the player However the player can shoot him before reaches the other side drops any Huns Shan hit just disappears like regular Huns Unlike regular Huns Hayabusa Shan himself does not directly aim attack huts repair carts firework carts During the release the original film Shan was featured parade float the Mulan themed parade Disneyland was shown being blasted firework referencing his demise Shan participated the Martial Arts Festival Disney Wide World Sports the resort property the former castle show Cinderella Surprise Celebration the Magic Kingdom the Evil Queen plans taking control and she sends Shan Jafar and Captain Hook away with Mickey Mouse Friends sneaks behind Donald and scares him saying Boo his face causing Donald faint Mickey calls forth Mulan Genie and Peter Pan character Peter Pan defeat the villains Shan trapped large birthday box with firework Mulan and dies the explosion the only villain killed the show This also the only Disney Park show event far where has speaking role the current fireworks show Happily Ever After fireworks show Happily Ever After Shan was the first villain appear after the Emperor said his quote about the flower that blooms adversity from the first film which told Shang encourage him follow after Mulan which starts the Adversity sequence where the Disney villains invade Cinderella Castle and fight the heroes 2013 and 2014 Shan was joined with other Disney Villains for the Unleash the Villains night time stage event hosted Hades Disney Hollywood Studios France Shan joined the Halloween get together with other villains The Disney Villains Halloween Party point the show briefly battles Governor Ratcliffe sword duel Shan briefly appears during the final scene The Nightmare Experiment well Villains Night Out According the writers the reason why they decided kill Shan the manner they did was that they wanted avoid the typical fall the death clich u00e9 that befell most Disney villains Considering the setting and their point origin Shan and his Hun Army could fact members the Xiongnu people possibly either Yeniseian Turco Mongol tribes who lived the lands north the Great Wall encompassing present day Mongolia and conquered much the East Asian steppes the 3rd century 1st century thought many that the Huns that invaded Europe around 370 are descendants the Western Xiongnu who fled from the Chinese what now Kazakhstan This further supported Shan name Shanyu Chanyu was what the Xiongnu leaders were called much like Mongol and Rouran leader would Khan Khagan Shan black eyes may procedure known scleral tattooing which tattoo ink injected into the whites the eye This procedure traditionally done certain cultures and still sometimes practiced today Alternatively could possibly with Mulan Shan Destroys the Village deleted scene where was originally intended have the magic ability see through Hayabusa the Falcon Hayabusa eyes this the case then possible that Shan may still possess this ability only simply chose not use during the film events used off screen also possible and more likely that could just stylistic choice like his fangs claw like fingernails and yellow iris make him look monstrous comparison everyone else the film Some Shan early designs depicted him even less human looking with blue skin red markings and completely white eyes with pupils possible was first planned some sort demon disguised human half demon Unlike most characters the film Shan does not underestimate women also unlike Chi does not silence and belittle Mulan when they converse with each other before his death When Mulan reveals that she caused the avalanche and came with the idea save the Emperor Shan instantly acknowledges that she both responsible and far greater threat him than Shang abandons him favor killing Mulan This arguably the biggest change the remake u00f6ri Khan indeed prejudiced against women This likely because believed that the Huns allowed women serve their military many the worst war crimes being caused such women Despite this women appear Shan army and they are all men However this could just simply that the women Huns stayed behind most common cases war the women usually stayed behind defend the territory look after the livestock children look after property while the men are away fighting could also because lost many his men because Mulan and she ruined his plans conquer China Strangely Cinderella Surprise Celebration does call Mulan weak female however this could just due lack research his character the people who wrote the script for the play and the play likely non canon the movie anyway Interestingly this also the only time actually calls Mulan her actual name since the movie did not get know her name before his death and simply referred her The Soldier From The Mountains Shan probably has the largest screen kill count any other Disney Villains Disney Villain and the few commit infanticide albeit off screen the few Disney Villains who does not sing have his own musical number However has recurring instrumental theme that heard throughout his appearances the film Shan was inspired the real life Attila the Hun Though while Shan died the hands fireworks Attila died choking his own blood the night was wed his future wife Ildico Coincidently the name the computer system that was used animate the Hun army charge was called Attila also possibly partly based Genghis Khan and the latter being the founder the Xiongnu empire who united the Xiongnu tribes While Shan was described the leader the Huns this historical misconception the Xiongnu were the tribal raiders that attacked China during the age Mulan The misconception comes from the fact that both Huns and Xiongnu originated from the Eurasian Steppe and shared many cultural and militaristic similarities However the Chinese dubs the film call them Xiongnu instead Huns This likely because the Huns are more historically well known outside China and the Xiongnu are more historically well known China also likely because the word Hun easier word use and understand for the English audience Xiongnu would more difficult pronounce There also the belief that the Huns are descendants Xiongnu after they fled the West While has not been fully proven yet this likely another reason why they were called Huns the movie Although Shan the main villain has only around six minutes screen time Shan was originally intended return Mulan earlier story treatment written Barry Cook where and his deceased army all ghosts now would have started haunt Northern China prompting the The Emperor China Emperor send Mulan and Shang there The finale would have involved Shan ghost army fighting against Mulan and her allies including the Family Ancestors http animatedviews com 2012 director barry cook remembers the peoples walt disney feature animation florida Director Barry Cook remembers the Peoples Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida http animatedviews com Animated Views Had this plot point been kept would have been the third Disney Villain return sequel after Jafar and Governor Ratcliffe and the only after having explicitly died his debut film early version the storyboard Mulan Alternative Opening for the opening scene has Shan being called Shang the dialogue the Emperor and General but the title used for the storyboard still has him called Shan unknown this error was originally intended called that before his name was changed during production avoid confusion with Shang name The same deleted scene also does not show Shan reaction the torches being lit instead shows him bursting into the wall tower rooms frighting and killing the guards inside then burning the puppet show they were watching leaving ambiguous whether intended for the torches lit unlike the film where was made clear such had been exactly his intent According his concept art Shan and half heads tall The same piece concept art also shows anatomy his skeleton which reveals appears have deformed spine One piece concept art drawn Pres Romanillos shows that Shan actually has official child form himself however this child version him has never been officially used any official Disney media Despite not having his army Huns Kingdom Hearts Mushu still referred Shan the leader the Hun army Shan considered the darkest merciless ruthless and most evil villains ever Disney movies Shan also suffers the most brutal and graphic deaths exploded fireworks screen For most the movie Shan holds his sword his ungloved right hand however for brief moment during his pursuit Mulan when manages break through the door and right before chops down the first wooden pillar seen holding the sword his left gloved hand before switching back his right This possibly means ambidextrous Disney Heroes Battle Mode the striped timber wolf scarf Shan wears part his hood missing Villains"
