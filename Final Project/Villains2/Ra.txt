But when the three Egyptians arrive to the Eternal City, it is revealed that their real intent is to mold it in the image of their homeland - and, for that, enslave the citizens.\n==Background==\n===Powers and Abilities===\nBeing a god, it is assumed that Ra:\n*is immortal, and cannot die;\n*can shape-shift, and is really able to alter his own size to titanic proportions;\n*can teleport from place to place instantly;\n*is extremely strong;\n*has the potential to do magic, including shooting explosive balls of energy from his rod;\n*is skilled at combat enough to dodge the slash of Nemesis and defeat her easily.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bastet is one of Ra's offspring and consorts along with Hathor, Sekhmet, and sometimes Satet.\n*In some versions of mythology, Khnum is Ra's father which makes Bastet to be both Khnum's granddaughter and daughter in law.\n*In the episode, Ra was the only one among Egyptian Gods to speak and didn't sound animal-like.\n*Unlike the Olympian deities in the film, Egyptian Gods' bodies and items were not glowing all the time; only when on attacking where Ra was the only one to glow his entire self, and others only glowed partial or item-only.\n*Ra was seen to call someone on \"phone\", using his rod.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nScreen Shot 2016-06-09 at 4.47.05 PM.png\nRA.jpg\nRA 2.jpg\nRA 3.jpg\nRA 4.jpg\nScreen Shot 2016-06-09 at 4.58.12 PM.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Mythology]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Falcons]]"
