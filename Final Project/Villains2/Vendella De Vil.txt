Despite being Cruella's dog, she doesn't pose as a major threat to the puppies, just an annoyance.\n\nVendella first appears in \"[[Best of Show]]\" when Cruella adopts her for the sake of appearing on the cover of a magazine, which was for the winner of a dog show. She introduces Vendella to the Dearlys and the puppies, and the pups show Vendella around. After snubbing the pups, they begin to hate her. [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]] decides to enter the pups in the dog show to compete against Vendella. So he enrolls them in a high-class training school, which is also attended by Vendella. To get them kicked out, Vendella puts a rose near [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]]'s rear for him to sit on the thorns when they are being instructed to sit. Lucky then finds out about what Vendella did, and the dogs attack each other, leading to the pups being expelled. After being trained at home, they attempt to compete against Vendella in the dog show. Because of the competition, Cruella orders Jasper and Horace to lock up the three puppies to prevent them from coming. [[Spot]], however, was able to be in the contest despite being a chicken, and beats Vendella, causing Cruella to get very angry at her for losing.\n\nVendella later appears in \"[[Two for the Show]]\", along with [[Scorch]], to compete in a game show against Lucky and [[Steven]] the alligator. Vendella has to leave the show later when she gets her tail bitten off by Steven after insulting him.\n\nHer last appearance was in \"[[My Fair Moochie]]\", when she is getting El Diablo ready to fight [[Mooch (101 Dalmatians)|Mooch]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although Vendella was supposed to appear in \"[[Best of Show]]\" first, she made her debut in \"[[Two for the Show]]\". This is because \"Best in Show\" ran in syndication on ''The Disney Afternoon'', while \"Two for the Show\" aired on ABC as part of ''[[Disney's One Saturday Morning]]'', and the episode order was messed up.\n*Vendella is the second De Vil pet in Disney adaptations, the first being [[Scorch]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nLucky Cadpig Rolly Spot Vendell.jpg|Vendella with [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]], [[Rolly]], [[Cadpig]] and [[Spot Chicken|Spot]]\n06c 0088f68f9e.jpg\nimagesCA85WN5L.jpg\nCruella & Vendella05.jpg\nCruella & Vendella06.jpg\nCruella & Vendella07.jpg\nCruella & Vendella08.jpg\nCruella & Vendella09.jpg\nCruella & Vendella10.jpg\nCruella & Vendella11.jpg\nCruella & Vendella12.jpg\nCruella & Vendella13.jpg\nCruella & Vendella14.jpg\nCruella & Vendella15.jpg\nCruella & Vendella04.jpg\nCruella & Vendella03.jpg\nCruella & Vendella02.jpg\nCruella & Vendella01.jpg\nVendella De Vil.jpg\nScorch Vendella TLSRM.jpg\nScorch Vendella CWAHBDL.jpg\nScorch Vendella WCDPWDL.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
