Deltan is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Deltan is a Gerudo who can be found depressed and hunched over at a table in The Noble Canteen in Gerudo Town. She is a graduate of Ashai's Cooking class.
Presumably intoxicated from drinking, Deltan mutters about "stupid voe" to herself if Link tries to speak to her. She's attempted to charm some voe with her newfound knowledge, yet all her attempts proved unsuccessful. Deltan complains about a man who told her that he is engaged but claims that she cannot be angry about it. She also complains about a man who only told her that he likes to cook after she took Ashai's Cooking class. Another man said that he does not like girls twice his height, which Deltan is confused by since she's only eight feet tall. Deltan grew her hair out because a man told her he liked long hair, but he then informed her that he liked short hair.
