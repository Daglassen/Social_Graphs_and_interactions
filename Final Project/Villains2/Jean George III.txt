He is the champion of the annual dogsled race who always cheats in order to win.\n\n==Role in the film==\nJean George was the champion of the dogsled race every year, by constantly cheating. He was seen sledding with his dogs on a mountain. Jean George drops by the store and asks Adam Bilson's father if the harnesses came in, which they didn't. He wonders if he was going to compete in this year's race and gloats that he won every year.\n\nLater at the race, he was booed and pelted by snowballs by the audience as he stepped in the starting line. Jean George managed to cheat by endangering the other competitors lives. After the snowstorm passed, he and Adam were the last ones standing. He abandons his dogs for drowning in the lake and walked to the finish line. When Adam and the buddies rescued them, Jean George steps in and continues to race anyway. [[Budderball]] stated that he was considered a double-crosser.\n\nIn the end, Jean George's dogs began to retaliate at him for betraying them and stopped running, giving Adam and the buddies the win. He was chased down by his dogs and presumed dead by their attacks after scolding at them.\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:George, Jean}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]"
