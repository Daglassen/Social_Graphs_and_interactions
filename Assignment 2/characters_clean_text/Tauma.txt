Tauma is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Tauma is a Hylian who can be found reading a book inside Hotel Oasis in Gerudo Town. She has a temper and is obsessed with keeping her skin smooth. If Link speaks to her, she asks if he is also there for the spa treatment. Tauma is annoyed by how long she has been waiting for the treatment. Before finishing speaking, she asks Link if he is getting in line. If Link speaks to Tauma again, she questions how long she will have to wait and says that she has read her book so many times that she could recite the dialogue. Tauma complains that she came there to reclaim her youth, but feels like she only lost more of it waiting there. If Link tells Tauma that he received the spa treatment when he did not, she knows that he is lying and comments that the Gerudo Desert heat has dried his skin. She goes on to explain that Romah's special skills leave people moisturized to perfection and expresses her hatred for lying. Tauma calms herself down in fear that she will create wrinkles between her eyebrows and loudly warns Link not to make her angry. If Link gets the spa treatment and speaks to Tauma, she will notice and mention that he looks relaxed and that his skin looks shiny.
