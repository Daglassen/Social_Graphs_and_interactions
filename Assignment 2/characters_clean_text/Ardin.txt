Ardin is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Ardin is a Gerudo who manages a General Store in Gerudo Town that specialises entirely in Mushrooms.
If spoken to, Ardin will tell Link that Gerudo use Mushrooms to keep their skin beautiful. Depending on the time of day, she will also remark that Link has a lot of energy being awake this early, if spoken to in the morning, or comment on the temperature if spoken to around noon or in the evening.
As a merchant Ardin is very keen to sell her wares, with her tactics ranging from persuasion to telling tall and implausible lies in order to make some money. If Link purchases all of the Mushrooms from her stall she will pretend her stall is full of rare and mysterious Mushrooms, that are only visible to the most beautiful. If Link talks to her about this, she will admit that after he bought all her Mushrooms she had nothing left to restock her stall with, but she think people will fall for this. She does in fact manage to convince both Jules and Nellie, although the latter requires Linkâ€™s help.
Despite her trickery, Ardin is genuinely interested in Mushrooms and will tell Link facts about them, such as that they enjoy the cool weather. She encourages Link to take an interest in them despite not being an expert herself, quietly admitting that although there is lots of interesting information about mushrooms she does not understand a lot of it.
