pain and damage that inflicts people well the terror that instills within them with his crimes also enjoys killing people especially innocent ones and very cold how deals with most people shows this how orders around Moose and Rocco However can very soft and paternal well shown how initially treats Buffy many ways this can seen redeeming quality Though the same time can also seen negative also very indulging his daughter which has clearly instilled spoiled entitled attitude into her Despite all this however Ratso also has short fuse trying object him usually results him letting loose and yelling whomever sets him off This not something from which Buffy safe either turns this side him her twice near the end the episode True type also has the urge murder people and even animals who
