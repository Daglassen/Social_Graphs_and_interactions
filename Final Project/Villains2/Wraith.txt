He is smarter than [[Siege]] or [[Chameleon]], but disdained by Dragaunus because of his firm belief that the dark magic of their ancestors is the only means for victory. He shuns weapons in battle, preferring to use his ability to throw fireballs, though in one episode he did mope how he never got to use a giant blaster on the Ducks. He is very glum and is often predicting the inevitable failure of their mission. Of course, he is usually proven right.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Of the four Saurians, Wraith is the only one who wasn't released in the series' toyline.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lizards]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
