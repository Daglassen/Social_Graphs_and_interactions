Laruta is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Laruta is a Zora child who can be found in Zora's Domain. Before Divine Beast Vah Ruta is appeased, she is with Tona and Tula, fellow members of Sidon's fan club. She sings part of the Ceremonial Song before asking Link who he is. Upon hearing he is a Hylian, Laruta grows excited and impressed. However, she says Prince Sidon is much cooler.
Laruta is present when King Dorephan thanks Link for appeasing the Divine Beast Vah Ruta and stopping the oncoming flood caused by it. She can be seen in front of the gathered Zora with the other Zora children, dancing from side to side. She cheers with the Zora after Sidon gives Link his thanks as well. Laruta can be found in front of Mipha's statue afterwards. If spoken to, she will start humming part of the Ceremonial Song before realizing that Link is the Hylian who aided Prince Sidon. She will comment on Link's looks, although she believes Sidon is handsomer. Despite this, Laruta invites Link to talk with her. If Link asks about the song she was humming, Laruta will respond that she loves to sing and that she even remembers the song from the Champion Festival. Laruta asks if Link wants to hear it and if the hero allows her, she will sing the melody. When finished, she will state that she does not understand the meaning of the song, but will sing it at the next Champion Festival anyway. She explains that Mr. Trello is in charge of organizing the festival, but has not prepared yet. Laruta wonders what is wrong with him, asking if he forgot his job. Laruta's song unlocks the Shrine Quest, "The Ceremonial Song".
