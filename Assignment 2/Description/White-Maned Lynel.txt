They have been in [[Hyrule]] since ancient times and only a few amount of witnesses of this breed survive to tell the tale.<ref>{{Cite|These fearsome monsters have lived in Hyrule since ancient times.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|There are so few eyewitness accounts of this breed because a White-Maned Lynel is not one to let even simple passersby escape with their lives.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> Like other Lynels, it will often refrain from attacking for a short period of time after spotting Link, instead opting to stare down its opponent. However, they start their battle by roaring out loudly and slamming its Weapon down to causing a fiery explosion around itself. Being a higher tier variant from the [[Blue-Maned Lynel]]s, it is known to carry a stronger set of \"Savage\" Lynel gear, such as a [[Savage Lynel Sword]], [[Savage Lynel Shield]], [[Savage Lynel Bow]], [[Savage Lynel Spear]], and a [[Savage Lynel Crusher]].\n\nIn [[Master Mode]], they carry \"Mighty\" Lynel gear. One also appears on the [[Great Plateau]] carrying a Savage Lynel Crusher and Savage Lynel Bow.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW A Premonition.png|Several White-Maned Lynels and [[Bokoblin]]s after being defeated by Link in the eighth [[Recovered Memory]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Malice Lynel|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Lynels\n |enemies= BotW\n}}"
