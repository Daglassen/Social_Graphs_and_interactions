He and the other marauders show up in the desert to attack the Riders of Ramond so they can steal their cargo. The fight makes a chest on an elephant's back open, and a crystal falls out of the chest and breaks, making Zarasto, the other marauders, and the riders vanish and repeat the day over and over again. Zarasto later has [[Abu]] and [[Carpet]] as his sidekicks. At the end of the episode, Zarasto and the other marauders are defeated by the riders after [[Iago]] catches the crystal, and Abu and Carpet turn back to normal.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]"
