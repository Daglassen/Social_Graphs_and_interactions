They are a kind of superpowered beings in Marvel, the others being [[Mutants]] and the [[Inhumans]]. \n\n==Background==\nEnhanced Individuals don't have the X-Gene like the Mutants or Terragenisis in their DNA like the Inhumans, but they can be born with their powers (like [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], [[Gamora]] and [[Groot]]). Alternatively, they also can have powers due to externals means, whether is by receiving superpowers through science (like [[Captain America]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Hulk]]), learning magic (like [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Wong]]), or wearing a suit of powered armor (like [[Iron Man]], [[War Machine]], [[Vulture (Marvel)|Vulture]] and [[Scott Lang]]).\n\nEnhanced Individuals can choose to use their powers for good, becoming superheroes, or for evil, becoming supervillains.\n\nUnlike Mutants and Inhumans, Enhanced Individuals don't isolate themselves from society, and they are not discriminated for their powers.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Enhanced Individuals who fought alongside Captain America became fugitives of justice. This was eventually solved when the Sokovia Accords were retired following [[Thanos]]' defeat and Iron Man's death.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The equivalent in the ''[[The Incredibles|Incredibles]]'' universe are the [[Supers]].\n\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Iron Man characters]]\n[[Category:The Incredible Hulk characters]]\n[[Category:Thor characters]]\n[[Category:Captain America characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Ant-Man characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:Guardians of the Galaxy characters]]\n[[Category:Doctor Strange characters]]\n[[Category:Black Panther characters]]\n[[Category:Eternals characters]]\n[[Category:Captain Marvel characters]]\n[[Category:WandaVision characters]]\n[[Category:The Falcon and The Winter Soldier characters]]\n[[Category:Loki characters]]\n[[Category:She-Hulk characters]]\n[[Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters]]\n[[Category:Agent Carter characters]]\n[[Category:Cloak & Dagger characters]]\n[[Category:Runaways characters]]\n[[Category:Helstrom characters]]\n[[Category:Daredevil characters]]\n[[Category:Jessica Jones characters]]\n[[Category:Luke Cage characters]]\n[[Category:Iron Fist characters]]\n[[Category:The Defenders characters]]\n[[Category:Fantastic Four characters]]\n[[Category:Moon Knight characters]]\n[[Category:What If...? characters]]\n[[Category:X-Men Cinematic Universe]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Assemble characters]]\n[[Category:Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. characters]]\n[[Category:M.O.D.O.K. characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Rising characters]]\n[[Category:Spidey and His Amazing Friends characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Secret Invasion characters]]\n[[Category:Armor Wars characters]]\n[[Category:Ironheart characters]]\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Shang-Chi characters]]\n[[Category:Black Widow characters]]\n[[Category:X-Men Cinematic Universe]]"
