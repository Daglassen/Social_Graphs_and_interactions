He is the father of [[Taskmaster|Antonia Dreykov]] and the head of the Red Room, an Soviet organization that trained young girls to become ruthless assassins.\n\n==Background==\nAs a high-ranking Soviet Armed Forces officer, Dreykov was put in charge of the Red Room, a top-secret Soviet training program that turned young women into the world's deadliest spies.\n\nAt one point, Dreykov discovered a young Russian girl named [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff]] and decided to take and train her to become a deadly spy. When Romanoff's family objected to this, Dreykov abducted the young girl through force and had her enlisted into his Red Room program. However, Romanoff's mother immediately opposed Dreykov and began searching for her daughter, in the hopes to get her daughter back. Noticing the woman's persistence and fearful of the Red Room's existence being exposed, Dreykov ordered Romanoff's mother to be assassinated. Dreykov subsequently had her body buried in an unmarked grave, as to keep her true identity from ever being revealed while continuing to train her daughter to be an assassin.\n\n===Personality===\nDreykov was a fierce and calculating individual while possessing a strong cunning streak and high level of intelligence. He was also abusive, ruthless, controlling and brutal, and lacked almost any form of empathy for the livelihoods of the girls he trafficked in and subjects to the treatments in the Red Room. A misogynist to the core, Dreykov saw girls as merely weapons to be used and thrown away when it suited his agenda of world domination rather than as individuals.\n\nDreykov was also apathic even towards his own allies including [[Red Guardian|Alexei Shostakov]], who he had sent to prison for reasons his former friend was unaware. Dreykov's apathy also extended towards his own daughter, Antonia, who he repurposed to be his \"greatest weapon\" following the assassination attempt on his own life, showing a complete disregard for her care and well-being.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]''===\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Generals]]\n[[Category:Black Widow characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
