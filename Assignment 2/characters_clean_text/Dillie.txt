Dillie is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Dillie is a Hylian traveler who can be found in the West Barrens of the Gerudo Desert with his friend, Jora. The pair can be found being attack by two Bokoblins. He's grateful if Link saves him, and will give him a Hearty Durian as a reward.
Afterwards, Dillie explains that he and Jora are going to Gerudo Town. They've heard it is a city of "foxy ladies" and think that the women will treat them like kings, asking Link if he is jealous of their plan and warning him not to copy their idea. He then questions what woman would be interested in a "skinny twig" like Link anyway. He also wonders what the women in Gerudo Town do all day and fantasizes about being the only man in the Town.
Once Dillie and Jora are saved, they'll stand beside each other while scouting out the Desert. Dillie wonders to himself whether they're lost.
If Link speaks to Dillie, he asks Jora if he is alright and reminds him that they are headed to Gerudo Town to cheer him up. As consolation, he offers to let Jora lead the way, shocking Jora and prompting him to ask when they decided he was leading the way. Exasperated, Dillie hunches over in disappointment and remarks that he's gotta be kidding him.
When Link speaks to Jora, he explains that Dillie knows the way out of the Gerudo Desert and to Gerudo Town. However, Dillie reveals that he thought Jora knew the way and was following him, much to Jora's surpise.
