Nikki is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Nikki lives in Hateno Village. She loves to gossip and is usually found trading stories with fellow villager Amira at the water trough next to the general store, East Wind. Should Link attempt to talk to her, she will shrilly accuse him of eavesdropping on their conversation. Trying to speak to Amira instead will get Nikki to shoo him away. However, Link can hide away behind the trough and overhear Nikki bring up a child being sighted at the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab. While Amira wonders if the girl lives there, Nikki assures her that the owners of the lab do not care for children. Nikki has an idea of who the girl is, but is quick to dismiss the thought.
She finally decides to go home at 9 o'clock to prepare for the next day, advising Link to do the same. At 5 in the morning, she wakes up to go to the water trough. Nikki claims she is going to work and is incredibly irritated if Link appears to be following her.
