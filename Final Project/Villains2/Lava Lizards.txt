They are a group of diminutive lizards sent by [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] to destroy Easter Island as part of his evil plans.\n\n==Background==\nLiving in a volcano at Easter Island, the Lava Lizards are shown to be destructive and dangerous when tasked by [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] to cause massive destruction in a plan to destroy the Earth as part of Felldrake's evil plans. When Sheldgoose causes the Moai statues to dance by putting the, on vacation mode, the Lava Lizards sneak past them without getting smashed in a plan to destroy the Earth. Later as the island where the Moai are dancing is filled with lava, the Lava Lizards even form a bridge to the mainland in a plan to continue succeeding their mission to which all of a sudden, the Lava Lizard Queen emerges to cause even more destruction on Easter Island. Later when the Moais copy [[Donald Duck]] angrily hopping on the platform he is standing on, the Moais where able to stomp them out of the island, causing some of them to retreat back to the volcano. After [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]], and Donald see the Moai Commander and they tell him to jump on the lava trail they are at, the Moai Commander does a big splash to remove the lava as the lava trail the Lava Lizard Queen is standing on hardens as she sinks to the bottom of the ocean. As the Lava Lizard Queen sinks to the bottom of the ocean, the Lizards then react to the loss of their queen as they retreat back to the volcano in defeat.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nThe Lava Lizards are diminutive-sized lizards made of lava. They are orange lizards with yellow reptilian eyes who are capable of forming into lava (as their names suggest) to cause destruction across Easter Island.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn \"[[No Man Is an Easter Island]]\", [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] and his ancestor [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Lord Felldrake]] approach the Lava Lizards who are trying to escape the volcano so that they and their queen can destroy the Earth due to their exits being blocked by the Moai statues who are constantly stomping them. Felldrake asks the Lava Lizards to know if they can destroy the world by causing a fiery havoc to which they agree as part of Felldrake's evil plans.\n\nLater when Sheldgoose distracts the Moai statues by putting them on vacation mode so they can party around the island, the Lava Lizards meanwhile plan to escape the volcano so they can destroy the Earth. As the Moai statues continue partying, Sheldgoose feels satisfied that his plan was successful. Later at the volcano, Sheldgoose asks the Lava Lizards to know that it is time for them to get out of the volcano to wreak havoc to which as they suddenly emerge from the volcano all of a sudden.\n\nLater when [[Xandra]] brings [[Aracuan Bird|Ari]] to help the Caballeros and as Xandra notices a volcano eruption far from her, she sees the Lava Lizards approaching the island, telling the Caballeros to look at the trouble Felldrake caused. Xandra tells the Moai statues to return to their posts, warning them about the Lava Lizards to which they refuse to listen due to them being under Felldrake's spell. The Caballeros are tasked to cancel the party while Xandra decides to find a way to stop the Lava Lizards from destroying the island.\n\nArriving at the volcano, Xandra discovers the culprit behind the trouble which is Lord Felldrake and his descendant Sheldgoose to which as Xandra attempts to knock the warlock and his ancestor off the volcano, the Lava Lizards block her arrows by grabbing them to protect Sheldgoose from being hit as the Lava Lizards arrive at the beach to destroy the island while avoiding the Moais. Noticing the Lava Lizards passing by, Xandra notices the Lava Lizards forming a bridge to the mainland to which all of a sudden, the Lava Lizard Queen emerges much to Xandra noticing Felldrake's evil plans as the Queen leads her minions to take her to the beach so that she can destroy the island as the Lava Lizards continue forming a bridge to the mainland. Noticing that she is having trouble defeating Felldrake and the Lava Lizards, Xandra arrives back at Chez Quackmore to get Donald to help her.\n\nWhen Xandra arrives at Chez Quackmore where Donald is having a date with [[Daisy Duck]|Daisy]], she takes him to Easter Island to help her and the Caballeros defeat Felldrake and the Lava Lizards. Meanwhile at Easter Island, the Queen of the Lava Lizards is getting close to mainland to which as Donald angrily hops on the platform he and Xandra are at, the Moai statues think Donald's meltdown is a new dance move as they stomp together and copy what Donald is doing, stomping the Lava Lizards out of the island as Jos\u00e9 and Panchito happily notice what the Moai statues are doing thanks to Donald. Believing that the Lizards are defeated, Jos\u00e9 shows Donald, Panchito, and Xandra that the Lizards' queen is heading toward mainland as Donald plans for a stage dive upon noticing the Moai Commander on the volcano to which when the Caballeros plan on doing so, he agrees and lands on the bridge the Lava Lizards have formed, much to Felldrake and Sheldgoose's shock as the Moai statues celebrate. The lava, however, begins to harden as the Queen of the Lava Lizards falls and sinks into the bottom of the ocean, forming into a lifeless stone form. Meanwhile, the Lava Lizards react to what happened to their queen as they retreat back to the volcano in defeat.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Lava Lizards are one of the monsters featured in the series' intro.\n*The proclamation of the arrival of the queen of the Lava Lizards sounds similar to the beginning of the song \"[[Prince Ali]]\" from ''[[Aladdin]]''.\n\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:Lizards]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
