She was dispatched by Lord Vader to find and kill [[Ahsoka Tano]] and her Rebel friends, coming absurdly close on many accounts. She often employs the use of [[ID9 Seeker Droid]]s on her missions, and wields the same model double-bladed [[lightsaber]] used by [[the Grand Inquisitor]] with deadly accuracy.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nThe Seventh Sister is tactically minded, and unlike her fellow Inquisitors, she considers killing her targets as not always the best approach. Instead of killing on sight, she prefers to play cat and mouse with her targets before taking her missions more seriously. This is seen in her first encounter with [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]] and [[Sabine Wren|Sabine]], as she simply walked after them while Ezra and Sabine tried to run away from her. When it comes to torturous interrogations, she displays no mercy and sometimes displays joy at using painful methods, she will use any methods necessary to get what she wants out of a person, even threatening to dismember her captives to this end. She combines her pure athleticism, overwhelming agility, extreme talent in lightsaber combat, and knowledge of the dark side of the Force with her high intellect. Like [[Agent Kallus|Kallus]] and [[Kassius Konstantine]], she holds the [[Fifth Brother]] in contempt for his short-sightedness and his inability to do the same. But, she personally felt despair about the Jedi Order's destruction despite her sadism.\n\nThe Seventh Sister is arrogant, and quite stoic and calm. The only time she displayed fear was at the time of her death when she was telekinetically incapacitated by [[Maul]] and visibly frightened, begging for mercy. She was briefly relieved when [[Ezra Bridger]] was unable to go through with killing her, but screamed in terror when Maul proceeded to decapitate her.\n\nThe Seventh Sister is merciless and cruel. Before abducting Alora, a Force sensitive child, she reminded the Fifth Brother of the need to kill everyone aboard the ship in order to prevent witnesses, even though they were just trying to survive.\n\nThe Seventh Sister has a certain level of respect for her opponents: she complements Ezra's skills to a degree. She even engages in flirtatious banter with her enemies. Despite her respect, the Seventh Sister usually makes fun of her enemies.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''[[The Force|Power of the Force]]:''' The Seventh Sister has a very strong connection to the Force, being one of the most powerful Force-users of her time.\n**'''Telekinesis:''' The Seventh Sister can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. Her combined usage of this ability with the assistance of the [[Fifth Brother]] allowed her to hold back the Rebel drop-ship, the Phantom, as it was taking off, though with a great amount of strain and for a brief time before it was able to break away from their grip, knocking her to the floor in the process as if she had been physically tethered to the craft.\n***'''Force Push:''' The Seventh Sister can telekinetically send her opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed.\n***'''Force Pull:''' The Seventh Sister can telekinetically pull her opponents or objects towards her.\n***'''Force Grip:''' The Seventh Sister can telekinetically lift her opponents off the ground and into the air to immobilize them. Her abilities allowed her to hold Ezra Bridger in place as he was running away from her and then pinning him against a wall with assistance from her probe droids.\n**'''Mind Trick:''' The Seventh Sister can control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills.\n**'''Mind Probe:''' The Seventh Sister can telepathically sense and sift through the thoughts and memories of other sentient beings for the purpose of interrogation or torture, although another Force-user can potentially resist this power.\n**'''Force Jump:''' The Seventh Sister can jump or leap at great distances.\n**'''Force Dash:''' The Seventh Sister can move at amazing speeds.\n\n====Abilities====\n*'''Expert Lightsaber Duelist:''' The Seventh Sister is a highly skilled lightsaber duelist, as she is one of the deadliest lightsaber duelists of her time. She was able to best [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Kanan Jarrus]] on several occasions with superior agility and unpredictable tactics, despite the fact that Kanan had bested her predecessor, the [[The Grand Inquisitor|Grand Inquisitor]]. She used an intense blend of overwhelming agility, speed, quickness, unexpected attacks and her talent in Form IV to make her a very deadly opponent. Therefore, it was physically impossible to best her in lightsaber combat. There were only two individuals ever known to have bested the Seventh Sister in battle, [[Ahsoka Tano]] who had to use a Force trick to disable the Seventh Sister's lightsaber and then Force Push her into a wall, and [[Maul]] who held her in the air using the Force and flung his lightsaber at her.\n**'''Form III:''' The Seventh Sister has some skill in Soresu, as she is able to deflect blaster fire with considerable ease.\n**'''Form IV:''' Due to valuing an athletic and speed-oriented style, the Seventh Sister is highly skilled in Ataru.\n*'''High-Level Intellect/Skilled Tactician:''' The Seventh Sister is highly intelligent and wise. As one of the highest-ranking Imperial Inquisitorius, the Seventh Sister is a skilled tactician.\n*'''Expert Pilot:''' The Seventh Sister is highly skilled in piloting several speeders and all types of flying crafts. In addition to being an excellent lightsaber duelist, she is also an expert dog fighter and fighter pilot, often using her TIE Advanced v1 to constantly terrorize her enemies.\n\n===Weapons and Equipment===\n====Lightsaber====\nThe Seventh Sister's valued weapon and possession is her red lightsaber.\n*'''[[Lightsaber|Double-bladed spinning lightsaber]]:''' The Seventh Sister had built a red double-bladed spinning lightsaber. It would remain in the Seventh Sister's possession until her death at the hands of [[Maul]], but it is unknown what happened to it after the Seventh Sister's death.\n\n====Droids====\n*'''[[ID9 Seeker Droid]]:''' The Seventh Sister is fond of employing ID9 Seeker Droids to track and attack her targets.\n\n==Role in the series==\nLittle known about the Seventh Sister's past other than she was a member of the Jedi Order. She became an Inquisitor after surviving Order 66 after being tortured and broken, before being corrupted and turned to the Dark Side, as all other Inquisitors were.\n\nUpon discovering Vader's former Jedi apprentice was still alive, the Seventh Sister took it upon herself to hunt her down. When members of the Rebellion were sent to salvage medical supplies from an abandoned medical station, she crossed paths with [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Sabine Wren]], and was unexpectedly joined by the [[Fifth Brother]] who had been dispatched by Vader to hunt Tano and the Rebels down. She then engaged Ezra in an lightsaber duel and easily overpowered him with little to no effort, mostly using her athleticism and lightsaber skills to intimidate him. Although Sabine escaped, the Seventh Sister managed to capture Ezra and prevented her fellow Inquisitor from killing him, as she needed him for interrogation. After sending the Fifth Brother to capture Sabine, the Seventh Sister took Ezra back to the command center for interrogation in an attempt to get him to reveal the location of the other rebels, most notably [[Ahsoka Tano]].\n\nLike [[the Grand Inquisitor]] before her, the Seventh Sister made efforts to convince Ezra in joining the dark side, noting that his [[Kanan Jarrus|mentor]] had never achieved the rank of Jedi Knight and was thus ill-qualified to instruct a Padawan. Ezra then cited Kanan's defeat of the Grand Inquisitor, something that the Seventh Sister admitted had been unexpected but presented the other Inquisitors with \"new opportunities.\" However, Ezra resisted her efforts to get information out of him, even when the Fifth Brother arrived with a captured Sabine. Apparently, the two Inquisitors were outwitted by Zeb Orrelios, and helped Ezra and Sabine escape her clutches. the Seventh Sister tried to prevent them from escaping but, as even as powerful as she was, she was unable to mantain her Force grip on the Phantom alone, resulting both Inquisitors to lose the Rebels.\n\nThe Seventh Sister was also tasked in hunting down Force-sensitive children, and eliminate any threat of them becoming [[Jedi]]. The Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother abducted a Force-sensitive baby known as Alora, killed everyone aboard the ship she was traveling in, and then journeyed to the planet Takobo in search of another. They tracked down the second child to an apartment but couldn't find it, since the mother sent him away with a droid. They soon caught up with the child and crossed paths with Rebel [[Garazeb Orrelios]]. They chased him to another apartment building, and before going in after him, the Seventh Sister dispatched another one of her droids to keep an eye outside. For a while, the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother lost track of Zeb and the baby, but would later cross paths with jedi, [[Kanan Jarrus]]. The Seventh Sister engaged him in a lightsaber duel, and proved to be more than a match for Kanan who she quickly overpowered twice.\n\nIn the Rebels' attempt to escape, the Seventh Sister encountered [[Ahsoka Tano]]. She was the first to engage the former Jedi, and though she was a highly skilled lightsaber user, she was caught by surprise by Tano\u2019s Force trick.However, it would be a minor defeat for the Inquisitors, because the Seventh Sister's droid later revealed where the Rebels were hiding. The Fifth Brother and herself would later accompany [[Kassius Konstantine|Admiral Konstantine]] and [[Agent Kallus]] in an ambush attack on the Rebels. Crossing paths with Ezra once again, the Seventh Sister dared him to fight, but Kanan stopped his apprentice by sealing the door, cutting her and the Fifth Brother off before they could engage Ezra, he knew the Mirialan Inquisitor would have easily killed his apprentice.\n\nShe and the Fifth Brother were contacted by the [[Eighth Brother]] to [[Malachor]] after being captured by Kanan and Ahsoka. She and the two other Inquisitors battled Kanan and Ahsoka but are overpowered when [[Maul]] and Ezra arrived. She stated that the rumours about Maul were true and he was alive so the Inquisitors retreated. She appeared again fighting Ezra and Maul, but the latter levitated her and told Ezra to finish her off, but he refused. So Maul threw his lightsaber at the Seventh Sister, killing her instantly.\n\n==Disney Parks==\nThe Seventh Sister is featured alongside [[Darth Vader]] in the show [[Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple]] at [[Disneyland]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sarah Michelle Gellar, who provides the voice of the Seventh Sister, did not get to see her design before she went in to provide her voice.\n**Ironically, Sarah Michelle Gellar's husband [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] provides the voice of [[Kanan Jarrus]], one of the protagonists.\n*Like [[the Grand Inquisitor]], she wields a double-bladed lightsaber that can rotate its blades. The only difference is that the disc design has a unique texture and curved points on the outer ring.\n*Her species and dark side affiliation led some fans to speculate that the Seventh Sister was in fact Barriss Offee, but no evidence exists to support the theory.\n\n==External Links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Seventh Sister|Wookieepedia}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Star Wars villains]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:Dark Jedi]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic characters]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
