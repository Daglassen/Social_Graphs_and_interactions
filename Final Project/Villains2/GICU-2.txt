It was created by [[Gyro Gearloose]] and its sole appearance is in ''[[Super DuckTales]]'', specifically the episodes \"Frozen Assets\" and \"Full Metal Duck\".\u00a0\n\n==Role in the Series==\nAfter having a terrible time keeping his fortune out of the hands of the [[Beagle Boys]], [[Scrooge McDuck]] seeks aid from his inventor friend [[Gyro Gearloose]]. Though busy with his own personal projects, Gyro agrees and builds a security robot capable of disguising itself as a van.\n\nAt the grand debut, Gyro initializes GICU-2 and mentions that the machine is now fully automatic, adding that there is no further need for the remote control. However, GICU-2 immediately sees the discarded device as an intruder and destroys it. To make matters worse, it views everyone in sight as a threat, including Scrooge himself.\n\nGyro looks to make amends by creating a robotic suit, which manages to fall under the control of [[Fenton Crackshell]]. Fenton, as Gizmoduck, reluctantly accepts Scrooge's request to get rid of the rogue robot. Having minimal success, Gizmoduck decides to push all of his buttons as a final resort, causing his suit to balloon out. This makes the perfect target for GICU-2, now having transformed into a crane, to use its wrecking ball on. However, after being launched into the sky, Gizmoduck comes crashing down onto the overzealous menace, destroying it for good.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGICU-2 - DuckTales B.png|GICU-2 on standby\nGICU-2 - DuckTales C.png\nGICU-2 - DuckTales D.png|GICU-2's pov\nGICU-2 - DuckTales E.png|Gizmoduck's turn\nGICU-2 - DuckTales F.png|Audio assault.\nGICU-2 - DuckTales G.png|A brief glimpse at the cream pie (just for humiliation's sake)\nGICU-2 - DuckTales I.png|Defeated\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
