== Biography ==
Pyle is a Goron who lives in Goron City. Pyle stands near the western entrance of the City and directs travelers to the Armor shop Ripped and Shredded, which sells the fireproof Flamebreaker Set. Pyle explains that ever since the Divine Beast Vah Rudania appeared, the climate has grown hotter and the shop has started selling the Flamebreaker Set in response. He adds that he used to be a miner at Death Mountain, but was laid off when Vah Rudania's emergence forced the mining company to move and to cut down its employees.
