Knowing his story, he murdered his first six brides and stuffed their corpses within a locked-off room in his home. His seventh bride, Lucretia however would murder him before he had the chance to kill her.\n\nBluebeard and (at-least six) of his seven brides were laid to rest in a crypt in the Haunted Mansion. By unknown means, this tomb came to be found in the Haunted Mansion in [[New York]]. It is unknown how, why or when this occurred as it is assumed Bluebeard lived in Europe.\n\n===Development History===\n\n====Fairy-Tale====\nBluebeard originates from the French fairy-tale '''Le Barbe Bleu''' written/recorded by Charles Perrault (better known for stories like ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''). The fairy-tale regarded an unnamed woman who married an ogre-like aristocrat with a dark blue beard and moved in with him in his, \"Fairy castle\".\n\nAfter he left, she went into the one forbidden room of the house where she found the corpses of his six prior brides. When Bluebeard discovered this, he informed her that they died for entering the forbidden room and that she must die as-well. However, the maiden's sister, Anne and her two brothers saved her by invading the manor to kill Bluebeard.\n\n====[[Disney Parks]]====\nBluebeard is notable in relation to the Haunted Mansion as he served as the inspiration behind the story of [[Captain Gore]], an unused character featured prominently in the development of the Haunted Mansion. Gore himself would go on to be the inspiration behind the [[Mariner (The Haunted Mansion)|Mariner]] and elements of [[Constance Hatchaway]] in the final attraction.\n\nTwo additional references to Bluebeard were planned for the [[Disney Parks]]. The first was developed by imagineer [[Herb Ryman]] earlier on into [[Disneyland]]'s development when [[Adventureland (Disneyland)|Adventureland]] was planned to have held a [[New Orleans Square]] style pirate criminal-underworld area with a black-market shop called ''Bluebeard's Den''. Concept art for this area was created by Ryman in [[1954]].\n\nDecades later in the 1990s, Bluebeard was planned to have made an additional appearance in the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version of the Haunted mansion. As shown by [[Marc Davis]] concept-art, this mansion would have featured a, \"''Burial Crypt of Famous Villains''\" where his crypt would have been seen marked with his name and a carving of a beard. His tomb would have been alongside those dedicated to [[Medusa]], Jack the Ripper, [[Dracula]], Nero and Attila the Hun. Medusa, Dracula, and Jack the Ripper would have been the only other characters to have appeared in the Haunted Mansion albeit as members of [[the Sinister 11]] portraits of which Bluebeard was not a member.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nBluebeard and his wives' crypt appears outside of the Haunted Mansion in [[Walt Disney World]]. The crypt reads as, \"''1440 Bluebeard;  Here lyeth his seven loving wives;  Seven winsome Wives, some fat some thin. Six of them were faithful but the seventh did him in.''\". It notably appears for photo-opportunities.\n\n==Other appearances==\n\n===The Ghost Gallery===\nIn the 1990s, cast-members of the Haunted Mansion in Walt Disney World created a backstory for the attraction as a means of answering guest questions. All of this backstory was recorded on paper and while unofficial, has since influenced both the original Haunted Mansion's official and semi-official features as-well as adaptations based on the Haunted Mansion.\n\nIn this story, Bluebeard was a 15th century pirate whose crypt was taken by the pirates Francis Xavier and Martin \"Whitebeard\" who were admirers of his. The crypt was placed outside of the mansion due to the manor having functioned as a pirate's lair at the time and following Whitebeard and Xavier's deaths they would often spend time with Bluebeard's ghost.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bluebeard dying in 1440 seems to be a reference to the historic Gilles de Rais who is sometimes believed to be the inspiration behind Bluebeard and who also died in 1440. Gilles was a contemporary of [[Joan of Arc]] who was supposedly a serial-killer and would be executed by hanging for alleged devil-worshiping, alchemy, witchcraft and the murders of children.\n**It should be noted however that it is widely believed amongst historians that Gilles de Rais was innocent and that the allegations against him were fabricated by his rivals, the catholic church and his in-laws as a means of claiming his wealth for their own with them having disdained Gilles due to his frequent supporting of the common-folk, anti-war sentiments, non-church owned cathedrals and apparent same-sex relationships.\n*Despite being a traditionally French character, the Bluebeard crypt's epitaph seems to be written in Old English.\n*Bluebeard being a pirate in the Ghost Gallery and in [[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'s development is likely a result of his name sounding similar to that of historic pirate [[Blackbeard]].\n*In the original fairy-tale, Bluebeard is referred to as an ogre. In the Haunted Mansion, one of [[the Sinister 11]] portraits is referred to as, \"The Ogre\" while having originally been designed to represent Grigori Rasputin (1869-[[1916]]).\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
