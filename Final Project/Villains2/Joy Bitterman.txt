Her last name reflects her personality. She claims she has not laughed since she left the Navy and most of the\u00a0''So Random!\u00a0''cast\u00a0accepts that statement as fact, when truly, Ms. Bitterman does laugh in the comedy show, or cackles when she is mocking the kids about their less than perfect grades or most other simple mistakes that they make. She also screams loudly as if watching a horror movie when the cast members get F's on their tests.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
