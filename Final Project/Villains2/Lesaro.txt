He is [[Captain Salazar]]'s personal right-hand man and assistant and his own most loyal crewman.\n\nHe was portrayed by Juan Carlos Vellido.\n\n==Background==\nLesaro is described as a ruthless lieutenant of [[Captain Salazar]]'s undead crew. When the rest of Salazar's crew was killed during an explosion, he was resurrected upon the discovery of the Trident, seeking revenge to kill [[Jack Sparrow]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===\nLesaro was the most loyal officer in [[Captain Salazar|Armando Salazar]]'s [[Crew of the Silent Mary|crew]], following his captain in his numerous pirate-hunting expeditions. After a battle against ten pirate ships, he informed his captian of the surrender of the pirates, but Salazar ordered their death.\n\nLesaro's loyalty eventually cost him his life when their ship sailed into the Devil's Triangle where the entire crew was killed in an explosion. However, Lesaro was resurrected by the supernatural powers of the Triangle with his crewmates as the undead. Hungry for revenge, the Spanish escaped from the Triangle and set out on a blind mission of vengeance to find the legendary Trident of Poseidon to kill the man they blamed for their fate - [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]].\n\nHe helped his captain in his quest for the Trident, and regained his human form after its destruction. As he, along with Salazar and the rest of the crew realized that the walls of water were being closed in around them, they all attempted to reach the anchor, their only way out of the depths of the ocean. Salazar and about two other crew members were able to make it aboard, leaving Lesaro and the remaining crew members to be devoured by the sea.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\npiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-1370.jpg\n4k-piratesdeadmen-movie-screencaps.com-9164.jpg\npiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-6136.jpg\nPiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-7273.jpg\npiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-7461.jpg\nSalazar_at_the_helm.jpg\nPiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-9039.jpg\npiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-12205.jpg\nHenry Salazar Lesaro.png\npiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-12802.jpg\nPiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-13036.jpg\npiratesdead-movie-screencaps.com-13037.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Lesaro's actor, Juan Carlos Vellido, previously portrayed an unnamed Spanish sea captain in [[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|the fourth film]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Lesaro Lesaro] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/  Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Lieutenants]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]"
