Thomas sees a paw button and presses it, causing the platform to raise with Tarik. Later,  they find the same trap hall the Buddies went through earlier, and Phillip pushes Seti onto a tile, who then steps on a wrong tile, falls into a snake pit and dies. Phillip then tries to have Tarik go, but the Egyptian man is too scared to do so and flees. However, he never manages to escape, as Tarik is eaten to death by carnivorous insects off-screen. The only thing left of him is his skeleton with his clothes still on.\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]"
