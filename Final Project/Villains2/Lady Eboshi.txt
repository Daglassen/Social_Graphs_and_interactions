"[[File:Eboshi.png|thumb|250px]]\n'''Lady Eboshi''' is the main antagonist of the [[1997]] [[Studio Ghibli]] film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (Although, some could argue the Monk [[Jigo]] is the bad guy whom she is working for). She was voiced by Y\u016bko Tanaka in the original version and [[Minnie Driver]] in the English dub.\n\n== Personality ==\nWhile she is the closest thing the movie has to the main antagonist, she is not really a villain. She is still likable and is well aware of the consequences of war. She just wants to create peace amongst the other humans. She doesn't want to harm the forest animals but has to hunt down the spirit god.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ghibli/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|ghibli|Lady Eboshi|Ghibli Wiki}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Studio Ghibli}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eboshi, Lady}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Studio Ghibli characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Miramax characters]]"
