Her store sells {{Term|BotW|Cooking|link}} ingredients, including {{Term|BotW|Rock Salt|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Tabantha Wheat|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Hylian Rice|link}}.\n\nLike many of the vendors in {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Town}}, {{Term|BotW|Spera}} is married to a man who lives outside of the town's walls and returns to the town in order to sell her wares.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, yes. And a newlywed, too! Many of the vendors who work at these stalls are married, in fact. It's pretty typical of married vai to live outside these walls, really. But we come back to sell our wares, of course! It does mean I don't get to see my husband all that often, but we have to make a living. So buy and sell all you like!|Spera|BotW}}</ref> She and her husband are newlywed and seem to be close despite how little they see each other, with the two of them agreeing that voe from other places are tiny,<ref>{{Cite|My husband says it, and I agree with him\u2014voe from other places are so tiny... I wonder if you people eat enough...|Spera|BotW}}</ref> and that the best meals are made with the best ingredients.<ref>{{Cite|Sav'aaq. You know, the best meals are made from the best ingredients... That's what my husband says, anyway. He's the one who does all the cooking, so I take him at his word.|Spera|BotW}}</ref> While {{Term|BotW|Spera}} runs the store her husband supplies the stock and does all the {{Term|BotW|Cooking}}.<ref>{{Cite|Sarqso! I gotta remember to tell my husband to get some more.|Spera|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Sarqso! I hope my husband stocked us up with enough.|Spera|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} speaks to {{Term|BotW|Spera}}, she will make different remarks depending on the time of day. In the morning, she asks him if he has already eaten<ref>{{Cite|Sav'otta. Have you already eaten this morning?|Spera|BotW}}</ref> and wonders if people who are not {{Term|BotW|Gerudo}} eat enough due to their small size. In the afternoon, she mentions her and her husband's views on fresh ingredients, and at night she will tell him that {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Town}} never sleeps and that as a result her store is always open,<ref>{{Cite|Sav'saaba... This is a city that doesn't sleep, so this store is always open.|Spera|BotW}}</ref> meaning that she often cannot go home to her husband.<ref>{{Cite|Unfortunately, being so busy means I don't often make it home to my husband...|Spera|BotW}}</ref> Regardless of the time of day {{Term|BotW|Spera}} will end their conversation by explaining that although they can get by with less sleep than most people, given how dangerous the desert can be it is important for {{Term|BotW|Link}} to rest when he is tired.<ref>{{Cite|We're fine getting less sleep than most folks, but with how dangerous the desert can be, it's good to stay alert... If you start feeling tired, be sure to take a break and get a good night's rest!|Spera|BotW}}</ref> {{Term|BotW|Spera}} will also apologise to {{Term|BotW|Link}} that her shop does not samples of the ingredients, but guarantees that he will like the flavor.<ref>{{Cite|...Oh, were you hoping for some samples? Sorry, but we don't really do that... I can guarantee that the flavor will be to your liking, though!|Spera|BotW}}</ref> If {{Term|BotW|Link}} buys all her stock she will give him thanks from both her and her husband.<ref>{{Cite|Sarqso from myself and my husband for buying everything.|Spera|BotW}}</ref>\n\n===Wares and Pricing===\n{{ShopItem/h|desc=yes}}\n{{ShopItem|BotW|Rock Salt|12|typeimg=Icon|desc=Crystalized salt from the ancient sea commonly used to season meals.
