He looked a lot like Winston, but with hair that wasn't slicked back.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nNelson Deavor.jpg|Maquette of Nelson\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Nelson was cut from the film, and was replaced by Evelyen, his design was reused for [[He-Lectrix]].\n\n{{The Incredibles}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar villains]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Incredibles characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
