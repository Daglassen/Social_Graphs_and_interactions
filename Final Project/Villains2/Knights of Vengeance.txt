"[[File:The_Knights_of_Vengeance.jpg|thumb|250px|The Knights of Vengeance]]The '''Knights of Vengeance''' are a group of villains who worked for [[Prince Phobos|Phobos]] and later [[Nerissa Crossnic|Nerissa]] only to be betrayed by her in the animated adaptation of ''[[W.I.T.C.H.]]''\n\n==Fall of Phobos==\nA group of warriors who were originally servants/fighters for Prince Phobos during his reign. They appeared individually in Season One, but after Phobos' defeat Nerissa gathered them into her henchmen, the Knights of Vengeance. Their objective was to restore Phobos to the throne and destroy [[Elyon Brown|Elyon]], the Guardians and the Rebels. They were the primary antagonists for the first half for Season 2, where, with the help of Nerissa, they planned numerous attacks on Meridian and the Guardians. After Phobos's breakout and attack on the palace in \"[[J is for Jewel]]\", Elyon locked them up in their cells along with Phobos.\n\n==Nerissa's Return==\nThey came back at the end of Season Two, when Phobos was released by the Guardians to help them get the Seal of Nerissa, but betrayed them and instead used the Seal for another attack on the palace, in which the Knights of Vengeance assisted. [[Prince Phobos|Phobos]], [[Miranda]], [[Frost The Hunter|Hunter]] and Crimson were locked up again. [[Raythor]], Sandpit and Gargoyle switched allegiances and helped protect the Palace. The [[Tracker]] was killed and Sniffer probably locked up again.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"250\">\nKnights of Vengeance.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
