"{{NeedImage}}'''Ymir''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appeared in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'', ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', and ''[[Marvel Super Hero Adventures: Frost Fight]]''. He is awakened from his ice volcano prison on Earth by Laufey as part of the [[Frost Giants]]' plot to bring an endless winter to Earth. Ymir then attacks [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] and the Hulks as they work to defeat Ymir. When [[Skaar]] tried to repeatedly stab Ymir, he froze Skaar who was caught by [[A-Bomb]] before he can hit the ground. Thor tells [[Hulk]] that they will have to find Ymir's weak spot. Skaar's sword was left in Ymir as the Hulk's act as they attack the weak spot. Before Ymir can hit A-Bomb, [[She-Hulk]] gets both of them out of the way. Thor comes up with a plan where he and Hulk attack [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] enough to heat him up and throws him towards Ymir which cracks up Ymir. Thor then fires his lightning which shatters Ymir as Laufey retreats back to Jotunheim. Later, Ymir collaborates with [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] to steal the powers of [[Santa Claus]].\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Norse Mythology]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
