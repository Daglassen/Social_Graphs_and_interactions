"{{Infobox character\n|name=Serge the Concierge\n|image=Serge the Concierge.png\n|shows=''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''\n|actor=\n}}\n'''Serge'''\u00a0is a character and antagonist in ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''. He was the previous concierge of the\u00a0[[Tipton Hotel]]. He only appears in the episode \"[[The Prince & The Plunger]]\".\n\n==History==\nSerge the Concierge is a liar; he lied about sending the flowers and poems to\u00a0[[Carey Martin]]. He seems to show a dislike toward her children,\u00a0[[Zack Martin|Zack]]\u00a0and [[Cody Martin|Cody]]. He treats them like young children, and the boys do not like that about him. Serge was the concierge for the Tipton. The hotel engineer, [[Arwin Hochauser]]\u00a0sent flowers and poems to Carey's doorstep, but when Zack, Cody and\u00a0Maddie\u00a0think it may be the new concierge who did it, Carey asks Serge out. Serge is then caught in a lie, but no one knows until the twins find out it is Arwin. On the date, Serge is called on his phone due to a customer problem. But there is no problem - Cody and [[Maddie Fitzpatrick|Maddie]] pull a prank on him so Arwin can make his move. Eventually Carey finds out, Serge is dumped and the twins spill goat milk on his head. Additionally, he seems to be a fairly good worker, but due to the incident he was probably fired. \n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Serge}}\n{{Suite Life}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Suite Life characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
