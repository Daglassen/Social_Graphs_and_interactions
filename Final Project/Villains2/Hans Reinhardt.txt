Cygnus]]. He, along with the rest of the crew, were all piloting to the black hole. However, Hans wanted to go inside of the black hole instead of seeing it at a distance. He then turned the whole crew into [[Humanoids]] and replaced majority of them with [[Sentry Robots]]. He, along with [[Maximilian]] (who is Hans best robot, who replaced [[S.T.A.R.]]) waited until it was the right time to go into the black hole. \n\nOnce the film begins, the crew of the [[U.S.S. Palomino]] is seen boarding the Cygnus, being introduced to Hans and Maximilian. Hans welcomes them to the Cygnus and tells them about what it has become. They then begin to believe what he says. However people such as [[Dan Holland]] and [[Harry Booth]] disagree on what he says and snoop around the Cygnus to find a truth. \n\nThese thoughts come real when [[B.O.B.]], the last droid of his kind on board the Cygnus, becomes friends with the crew telling them of the evil plot Hans has created of going into the black hole. Meanwhile, Maximilian kills Alex Durant and takes [[Kate McCrae]] hostage, leaving the crew to save her. \n\nUnlikely, Harry refused to save Kate, sending him and the Palomino back home, but he was shot down by Maximilian and crashed into the Cygnus, killing him. The rest of the crew now have to head to a [[Probe Ship]] to get home. When things go wrong trying to enter the black hole, possibly destroying majority of the Sentry Robots, Humanoids, and S.T.A.R., Hans realizes he has to get to the Probe Ship first before the crew of the Palomino do.\n\nRight when Hans is about to leave, a giant TV screen crashes onto him, leaving him stuck on the Cygnus and heading to the black hole. He contacts Maximilian and the Humanoids to help, but Maximilian left and the Humanoids refuse to help Hans, for he isn't in power anymore. The rest of the remaining crew of the Palomino fight Maximilian, destroying him, and board the Probe Ship and make it out alive. \n\nHans is finally seen grasping onto the destroyed Maximilian, and is then seen inside of his body standing on a hellish landscape, surrounded by Humanoids and broken down Sentry Robots.  \n\n==Personality==\nA madman, Hans has converted many of his crew on his ship into robotic slaves.\n\n==Role in the film==\nHans Reinhardt is the main villain of the film, a mad scientist and captain of the Cygnus.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBlack-hole-disneyscreencaps.com-8727.jpg\nCap041.JPG\nBlack-hole-disneyscreencaps.com-9985.jpg|Hans Renhardt's defeat\nTumblr_nc7zzarD8t1qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg\nTumblr neuqrbyfz31qhcrb0o2 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Black Hole}} \n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reinhardt, Hans}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Black Hole characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n\n[[Category:Scientists]]"
