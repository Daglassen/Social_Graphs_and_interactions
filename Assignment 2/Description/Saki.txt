She hesitantly asks [[Link]] if she can help him but tells him to forget it when he asks what is wrong.<ref>{{Cite|...Can I help you?... Never mind. Forget it.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> When asked again Saki says it is not a good time.<ref>{{Cite|Hello. Please. Now is not a good time.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> Saki is more open with Link after hearing his conversation with the [[Kaneli|elder]].<ref>{{Cite|Forgive my intrusion, but I overheard you speaking with the {{Color|BotW Blue|elder}}.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> There is not much she can do to help the hero in his fight with Teba against {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Medoh|link}} beyond telling him where her husband went.<ref>{{Cite|It sounds like you intend to help my husband, Teba, in the fight against {{Color|BotW Blue|Medoh}}. But to tell you the truth, there is not much I can do for you right now beyond telling you where my husband went.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> Her husband had headed to the [[Flight Range]] in [[Dronoc's Pass]] at the base of the [[Hebra Mountains]], likely to gather weapons for another run at Vah Medoh.<ref>{{Cite|Well... My husband headed to a place called the {{Color|BotW Red|Flight Range}}. It's in {{Color|BotW Blue|Dronoc's Pass}} at the base of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Hebra Mountains}}... I imagine he's gone there to gather weapons for another run at {{Color|BotW Blue|Medoh}}.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> She directs Link to [[Revali's Landing]], where can take off for a straight shot to the Flight Range.<ref>{{Cite|If you take off from {{Color|BotW Blue|Revali's Landing}}, it's a straight shot down to the {{Color|BotW Red|Flight Range}}.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> Saki continues by explaining that it is a memorial named after the [[Rito]] [[Champion]] [[Revali]] so that none may forget the events of that [[Great Calamity|horrible day]].<ref>{{Cite|Revali's Landing is a memorial for the Rito Champion, Revali... So named in hope that none might forget the events of that horrible day...|Saki|BotW}}</ref> This initiates the [[Memory]] [[Revali's Flap]]. Saki expresses concern for Link, calling him \"Descendant\" once the memory has ended.<ref>{{Cite|Descendant! Descendant! Are you all right?|Saki|BotW}}</ref> Fearing she has said too much, Saki apologizes and says that if there is anything he does not understand do not hesitate to ask.<ref>{{Cite|My apologies... I fear I have said too much... If there is anything you do not understand, please do not hesitate to ask.|Saki|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link returns to Saki after meeting Teba,  she is relieved and happy to hear he is still alive.<ref>{{Cite|You met my husband? Ahhh... That is a relief. I'm just happy to hear that my husband is still alive...|Saki|BotW}}</ref> As thanks, Saki gives Link ten [[Bomb Arrows]].<ref>{{Cite|... It isn't much, but please take these as thanks.|Saki|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|A bundle of 10 bomb arrows. The explosive powder packed into the tips of these arrows ignites on impact, dealing big damage to anything caught in the blast.|N/A|BotW}}</ref> Her husband had left the arrows for Saki to use but she does not want them in the house where Tulin might play with them.<ref name=\"Tulin\"/> \n\nAfter the Divine Beast Vah Medoh has been appeased, Saki is reunited with Teba in their home. Thanks to his wife, Teba has recovered from the injuries he sustained to the point where he can stand.<ref>{{Cite|It's fine. Thanks to my wife, I've recovered to the point where I can stand.|Teba|BotW}}</ref> Saki told Teba that Link is a descendant of the Champion, with Teba believing this to be true despite Link's words.<ref>{{Cite|Actually, my wife told me something about you. She says you're a descendant of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Champion}}... Don't tell me... You're the {{Color|BotW Blue|Hylian Champion}}?!... Hahaha! Good one, pal! Everyone knows that all of the {{Color|BotW Blue|Champions}} were wiped out by {{Color|BotW Red|Calamity Ganon}} 100 years ago...|Teba|BotW}}</ref> Teba had told Saki everything about the Flight Range and the fight with Vah Medoh and that the Divine Beast being perched above the Village means that everything is back to normal.<ref>{{Cite|Teba told me everything... About the {{Color|BotW Blue|Flight Range}}... The fight with {{Color|BotW Blue|Medoh}}... And that {{Color|BotW Blue|Medoh}} being perched above the village means that everything is back to normal.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> Saki cannot begin to express her gratitude at having her husband home safe and sound.<ref>{{Cite|To have my husband home safe and sound... I cannot begin to express my gratitude.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> Saki will leave her home after Teba brings Tulin to the Flight Range.<ref>{{Cite|Hello, {{Color|BotW Blue|Champion}} descendant. If you need my husband, he took Tulin to the {{Color|BotW Blue|Flight Range}}.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> Now that they are at peace again, she would rather they stopped doing such dangerous training but Teba insists.<ref>{{Cite|Now that we are at peace again, I would rather they stopped doing such dangerous training, but Teba insists.|Saki|BotW}}</ref> He keeps saying it is to help Tulin come of age as a warrior, but Saki thinks otherwise since he is still a fledgling.<ref>{{Cite|He keeps saying it's to help Tulin come of age as a warrior or something. But Tulin's still a fledgling...|Saki|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Hyruleans, Rito, Rito Villagers\n |characters= BotW\n}}\n[[de:Saki]]"
