He is voiced by Dee Snider.\n\n==Personality==\nThe self-proclaimed head honcho of Motorcity, the Duke is a wealthy, egotistical man that presents himself with a larger than life rock star personality. With his wealth and resources, he commands respect throughout Motorcity's underworld and others and never takes any sign of disrespect well, putting a price on Mike and the Burners heads. When they turn the tables on him and convince the bounty hunters to turn on the Duke, he respects the Burners enough to call it off. He remains on somewhat better terms with the Burners, but still wants to see what he can get out of them, such as his attempts to get Mutt in betting over a race.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Motorcity}}\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Motorcity characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
