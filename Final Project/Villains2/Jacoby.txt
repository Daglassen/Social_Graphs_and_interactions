He is a cursed pirate serving under [[Hector Barbossa]] aboard the [[Black Pearl]].\n\n==Background==\nJacoby joined in Captain Jack Sparrow's team to seek [[Isla de Muerta]]. However, the entire crew, with the exception of [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]], who later was sent overboard, planned to rebel against Jack and chose the first assistant Hector Barbossa as Captain, and Jacoby joined them. Soon, they fulfilled this cunning plan, having thrown Jack on the uninhabited island. After this, the crew, now serving as Barbossa, continued on to the Isla de Muerta. There they took the treasure of Cortez and spent it all on the joys of life. Only then did the crew realize that the treasure was cursed. Jacoby could not die and felt neither pleasure nor pain. Under the moonlight, he and the team became skeletons, and the undead people began a quest to recover all eight hundred and eighty-two gold coins in Isla de Muerta.\n\n===Development===\nDuring the early development of The Curse of the Black Pearl in 2002, in the first screenplay Jacoby was depicted very differently. When he first encountered Will Turner during the attack on Port Royal, he was described as a one-armed pirate wearing a yellow bandana and his role, in further, was a little more.<ref name=\"CotBP script\">[http://www.wordplayer.com/archives/PIRATES.script.html Wordplay: ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' first draft screenplay]</ref>Not only that, in this version Jacoby was not so evil. As  was shown when the Black Pearl first arrived at Isla de Muerta with Elizabeth as a victim he was depicted as hesitant and very loyal to Hector Barbossa, unconditionally  to obey his order, when he ordered Elizabeth to be taken to the deck.\n\nAll changed, when they started making adjustments to the script. After that, inspired by [[Blackbeard]], [[Ted Elliott]] decided to change Jacoby's appearance, making him more like him. It was decided to give him a beard with lighting fuses at its ends and make him a pirate with bombs, what were to alluded to  his new \"explosive\" nature, as a result he was made more twisted and quick-tempered.\n\nThe original design of the skeleton form of cursed Jacoby was developed by designer and art director Aaron McBride in late 2002, when the final version of Jacoby with a beard was already completed. According to him, he loved the idea of \u200b\u200bkeeping a piercing ring through what remains of his nose, thanks to which this ring was added to his nose, in the end.\n\n===Personality===\n{{Quote|I\u2019m gonna teach you the meanin of pain!|Jacoby to [[Will Turner]]}}\nJacoby was a immoral and cruel man without any moral principles and with a complete lack of humanity during lootings. Additionally, Jacoby seems to some extent to is insane, and explosions and destruction delivered him special pleasure. This is especially was seen during the attack on the [[Port Royal]], where he began to throw bombs at houses with wild cries and then laugh when they exploded. However, when Will Turner planted a bomb in him, Jacoby tried to pull out her, implied, that he, at least, was could think adequately.\n\nOn the other hand, Jacoby was a greedy and unreliable. He joined the team of captain [[Jack Sparrow]] because of the desire to enrich himself on Isla de Muerta and spend all for his joys. Although Jacoby was ready to show loyalty to his captains, this only as long as it benefits him, as this evident, when he did not hesitate betrayed Jack and supported the rebellion against him, unlike Bootstrap Bill Turner. Jacoby also is quite quick-tempered and agressive, as this is seen when during the battle of Isla de Muerta, he got so angry that he started throwing bombs at Will Turner, and his subsequent quote (\"I\u2019m gonna teach you the meanin of pain!\") indicates that he had sadistic inclinations.\n\nAfter Jack's overthrow, Jacoby was loyal to Hector Barbossa, but when he, like the whole team fell on the Aztec curse, he became very dissatisfied by him because of this, since he lost the opportunity to eat and quench hunger, drink, and quench his thirst and all other human joys. After this, the loyalty of Jacoby to Barbossa began to rest only on his promise to lift the curse. And when the curse dont lifted with the help of Elizabeth, he did not hesitate to support the idea of overthrowing Barbossa. But at the same time he was to some degree hypocritical, because, when it came to fighting with Barbossa, he did not dare to challenge him and he did not defend his position, knowing that Barbossa was a skilled swordsmanship.\n\nDespite manifested careful about Barbossa, Jacoby was a ruthless man, prone to kill without hesitation or to take up for the bombs, so that he could quickly deal with his opponents, regardless of what the consequences would be. Like the whole Cursed crew, due to suffering from a curse, Jacoby's demeanor took a turn for the worse: he became even more spiteful and would not spare anyone so that he would collect all the coins and remove the curse.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDepicted by Vince Lozano, Jacoby looks exactly the same, like he: has light skin, short stature, blue eyes, and dark eyebrows. An exception characteristic of Jacoby himself is a wild look, a ring, pinned to his nose, and a long black beard with smoking ends, similar to the beard of the Blackbeard.\n\nThroughout the film, Jacoby wears a gray worn waistcoat, a white dirty shirt underneath him, an and an obliquely fitted brown belt to which his bombs are attached. On head Jacoby wears a red cap with a white stripe and without a top, thanks to what is visible, that he is bald. In addition, he wears gray shabby trousers, which are lined with a second brown belt, to which his pistol and sword are attached.\n\nUnder the influence of the moonlight and curse Jacoby looks like a skeleton and his clothes become a tattered and full of holes. The only thing that does not change its appearance is its belt with bombs and a beard.\n\n===Power and abilities===\n*'''Immortality:''' Like the whole Cursed crew, due to a curse Jacoby for a long time was invincible to weapons such as the sword, pistol, and axe that Will launched into him when they attacking Port Royal. However, his immortality was not enough to survive the explosion of the bomb invested in him by Will: he died before the spell fell.<ref name=\"Twitter Vince Lozano\">[https://twitter.com/vincelozano/status/929170626601934848 @vincelozano Vince Lozano] on [https://twitter.com Twitter]</ref>\n*'''Using of bombs:''' Jacoby compensated for his lack of swordsmanship skills with bombs: it was thanks to the bomb that he almost succeeded in defeating Will in the battle of Isla de Muerta if Elizabeth Swann had not intervened. However, ironically, he also died from his own bomb, which Will later invested in him.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''===\n[[File:Jacoby in Port Royal2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jacoby in ''The Curse of the Black Pearl''.]]\nJacoby first appeared during the attack on Port Royal to get the final coin. During the attack, he threw bombs at several buildings and damaged them, but was soon struck when Will Turner tossed an ax in his back while he pursued the screaming woman. However, because he was cursed, Jacoby urvived, and later, at the next meeting, threw a bomb at Will. But the bomb did not explode, but then another pirate soon stunned Will with a blow to the head. By the time Pintel and Ragetti abducted Elizabeth Swann, the rest of the crew, along with Jacoby, were returning to the boats. They sat on the Black Pearl with Elizabeth, who claimed to be linked to Bootstrap Bill Turner. In fact, she just imagined a relative of Bootstrap. The pirates, however, thought that this was finally a chance to raise their curse, and so they began to return to Isla de Muerta.\n\nLater Jacoby helped prepare a dining table for Elizabeth and Captain Barbosa. He and the rest of the crew were carrying exotic food in the captain's cabin. After that, he worked with the other crew members on the ship in the moonlight, which caused their skeleton shape. When Elizabeth emerged from the cabin, she was frightened of the damned pirates. Jacoby and the rest of the crew laughed when Barbossa frightened Elizabeth and made her run back into the cabin. However, after Barbossa shouted at them to return to work and the work resumed.\n\n[[File:Jacoby uses his bombs.jpg|thumb|250px|Jacoby use his bombs against Will Turner.]]\nWhen the Pearl later reached Isla de Muerta, the crew sailed on the boats to the cave. Learning that the curse is still working and Elizabeth is not related to Bootstrap Bill, Jacoby, along with the entire crew, briefly supported the idea of overthrowing Barbossa, but he did not quit. And when they saw that Elizabeth had fled with the medallion, the pursuit began.\n\nLater, Jacoby took part in the pursuit of [[HMS Interceptor]], in which Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann and the former crew of Jack Sparrow tried to escape. The end result, Black Pearl eventually overtook the Interceptor and Turner made a deal with the damned team: he would take part in a blood sacrifice if they released Elizabeth and the captured team. After that, Turner and the crew were placed in the prison cell, and Jack and Elizabeth were sent to walk on the board and dropped into the sea.\n\n[[File:Jacoby before death.png|thumb|left|250px|Jacoby before death.]]\nWhen the second blood ritual began, this time with Will Turner as a victim, Jacoby, along with the whole team, was shocked when Jack Sparrow appeared and made a deal with Barbossa; he will become the captain of the Black Pearl, while Barbossa will become the Commodore of the fleet, which they will build since the [[HMS Dauntless]], which, as it turned out, was docked from the outside. After that, the cursed team went to capture Dauntless, and Jacoby stayed in Isla De Muerta with Barbossa, Jack Sparrow, Turner, and two more pirates. He guarded Turner, but when Jack turned against them and threw a saber to Will, Jacoby fought against Will, along with those two pirates. At some point, during the fight, Jacoby threw a bomb at Will and, knocking him to the ground, was already ready to kill him, but he was prevented by Elizabeth Swan, who hit him with a paddle blow, and, afterwards, joined the fight. She and Will teamed up and stuck an oar in Jacoby with those two pirates. They could not pull him out and tear himself apart, and soon Will put the bomb in Jacoby's stomach while he was in skeletal form, and then pushed him out of the moonlight. All three pirates nailed to each other with an oar, exploded and died before the curse fell, and when the curse was lifted, they were finally resting.\n\n==Printed media==\n===''Pirates of the Caribbean: Six Sea Shanties''===\nJacoby appeared in this novel in issue \"Strangers Bearing Gifts - A Tale of the Black Pearl\".\n\nDuring the sailing, he and the Cursed crew of the Black Pearl found a young boy in the middle of the ocean, somehow still alive and wearing shackles. After the questioned by Barbossa, the boy revealed he had found the Fountain of Youth and that his name is Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Though Barbossa doesn't believe him, he followed Juan's directions in the hopes he would lead them to the Fountain and cure the crew's curse.\n\n\"Juan\" leads them to an island, where he turns on the Black Pearl crew and reveals himself to be a sea god/demon named Palaimon, who feeds on and collects the souls of pirates and sailors to extend his life. Jacoby and the crew of the Black Pearl defend themselves against Palaimon's army of souls, during which we see [[Ragetti]] lose his eye. The end result, Barbossa defeats Palaimon by forcing him to fall into the sea.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''===\n[[File:Jacoby_in_Kingdom_Heart_II.png|thumb|right|250px]]\nJacoby appears in the game as a pirate which along with other damned pirates, serves under the command of Captain Barbossa abboard the Black Pearl. During [[Sora]]'s first visit to Port Royal Jacoby, along with other damned pirates in his quest to remove the curse from himself and all team, came attack on Port Royal and loot his, and later showed his punishment for stealing Aztec treasures before [[Pete]] when he warns the team about Sora and his friends. The damned pirates then begin to attack Sora, who soon arrives with [[Donald]] and [[Goofy]].\n\nUpon arrival at Isla de Muerta, Jacoby and other damned pirates are present when Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth Swann and tries to use her blood to break the curse. However, nothing happens. And in anger, Barbossa fails to notice Will Turner taking away Elizabeth. Thereafter, they with Barbossa take part in the pursuit of the Interceptor and after a lengthy battle for the medallion, taken captive Sora and the ship's passengers and the Interceptor itself is destroying.\n\nBack at Isla de Muerta, Jacoby and other damned pirates are present when Barbossa performs the ceremony with Will, but they are attacked with Sora, Jack, Donald, and Goofy. While Sora and gang dealt with the Jacoby and others crewman, Jack duels with Barbossa until Jack is stabbed. However, Barbossa is stunned to find that Jack was under the curse as well; secretly taking an Aztec coin from the chest. Jack and Will lift the curse just after Jack fatally shoots Barbossa with the shot.\n\nAfter Barbossa's death Jacoby, along with other surviving pirates allied with [[Luxord]] during Sora's second visit, who granted their immortality back to them. They again appear throughout Port Royal as generic enemies.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow]]''===\nAs in the film, here Jacoby acts like a pirate with the team of Barbossa. And his role is similar to the one in the film: during the battle at Port Royal, he acts as the first boss to be defeated by Jack Sparrow and Will Turner and use of bombs in combat, which makes him a serious opponent.\n\n===''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]''===\nJacoby appears in this game as a pirate who is a member of the cursed crew of the ''Black Pearl'' under the command of Hector Barbossa, but here his role is different. He is a playable character who can be purchased for a cost of 10,000. He is able to walk underwater and use bombs that can destroy not only regular objects but also silver objects that can only be destroyed using explosions. The player must complete the \"Isla de Muerta\" level in the ''Curse of the Black Pearl'' campaign in order to unlock him.\n\nIn the handheld versions, he was dueling at Isla de Muerta to gain access to Will Turner and the boss level, Barbossa. The player must complete the \"Isla de Muerta\" level in the ''Curse of the Black Pearl'' campaign in order to unlock him, like in the console versions. Once the level completed, Jacoby is unlocked for Free Play mode.\n\n===[[Disney Crossy Road]]===\nAlthough Jacoby does not directly indicated in the game, the Pirate With Pigs character has his appearance. The only difference is his red cap on his head, which looks bigger.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nJacoby made a minor appearance in [[Disneyland]], due to the addition of cursed pirates to the show.\n\n===[[Disneyland Resort]]===\nIn the Disneyland version of [[Fantasmic!]], Jacoby and other characters from The Curse of the Black Pearl were added to the show in [[2017]]. He appears here as one of the cursed pirates who perform tricks along with Hector Barbossa, Elizabeth Swann and Jack Sparrow on the [[Sailing Ship Columbia]], which has been transformed into the Black Pearl, when the ship makes its pass on the [[Rivers of America]].\n\n===[[Walt Disney World Resort]]===\nIn [[Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] in the [[Adventureland]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] Jacoby's name crossed out is found in a list of customers in [[Tortuga Tavern]] under the crew of the Black Pearl. Captain Jack Sparrow has crossed off Hector Barbossa's name and added his own, as well as crossed out the names of several other pirates, including Jacoby.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jacoby's age is based on his actor Vince Lozano age during the filming of The Curse of the Black Pearl. Vince Lozano was 50 during the filming The Curse of the Black Pearl.<ref>https://www.celebrityhow.com/vince-lozano-age-height-weight-husband-net-worth-bio/</ref>\n**From of this follows that Jacoby was born in 1678, when you consider that the events of the film took place in 1728.\n*After the explosion at Isla de Muerta, it has been debated for a long time whether he died as a result of the explosion or from the fact that he was unable to collect his bones before the curse was lifted. Vince Lozano, however, eventually confirmed that Jacoby actually died before the curse was lifted.<ref name=\"Twitter Vince Lozano\">[https://twitter.com/vincelozano/status/929170626601934848 @vincelozano Vince Lozano] on [https://twitter.com Twitter]</ref>\n*In the first draft of the screenplay for The Curse of the Black Pearl, Jacoby's death was different. During the fight on Isla de Muerta, Will smashes Jacoby in the jaw, breaks him and after that crumple him.<ref name=\"CotBP script\">[http://www.wordplayer.com/archives/PIRATES.script.html Wordplay: ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' first draft screenplay]</ref>\n**It is noteworthy that, in the early screenplay, Jacoby fought Will alone, while in the original with two other pirates.\n*The Undead Grenadiers from [[Pirates of the Caribbean Online]] is based on the concept art of Jacoby. However, unlike Jacoby himself, the grenadiers do not have a beard.\n*According to the last interview with Vince Lozano, Jacoby was Hector Barbossa's right hand man.<ref>https://worldfilmgeek.com/2019/10/18/the-pirates-return-an-interview-with-vince-lozano-and-martin-klebba/amp/?__twitter_impression=true</ref> From this it can be assumed that Jacoby was one of the ship's mate of Barbossa.\n*When ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was shown on BBC, the movie was edited to remove its violence, the sound of the impact when Will Turner threw his axe into Jacoby's back and Jacoby's scream of agony were taken out for censorship reasons, occurring during the scene where the ''Black Pearl'' attacks Port Royal.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:pirates:Jacoby|Jacoby]] on [[w:c:pirates:Main Page|Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki]]\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]"
