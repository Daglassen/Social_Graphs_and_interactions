Hoz is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Hoz is a soldier who works to fend off monsters from the East Akkala Stable in the Akkala Highlands region. He speaks about how people at the stable are uncomfortable due to rumors of a suspicious figure named Kilton, who runs a business called Fang and Bone that only appears at night. He asks Link to investigate this person and to come back and tell him what Kilton looks like, which initiates the side quest "A Shady Customer".
Upon completion of "A Shady Customer", Hoz remarks that he thinks Kilton is strange. He also starts to theorize what kind of things Fang and Bone, Kilton's shop, might sell. The more he starts to think about it, the more he becomes afraid of what it might be.
