While he poses as a nice guy in front of the masses, he is really an antagonistic businessman who is slightly on the dim side. McFist is easily angered, bad-tempered, and prone to violent outbursts; however, he is also quite dim at his job, although he does seem to be getting better as time goes on. He also will often claim any successful idea as his own, despite his seeming lack of intelligence, several of his schemes have come close to succeeding. He's also reasonably capable of creating a friendly facade for the masses, although he does slip on occasion. Despite being an evil man, McFist does truly love his wife [[Marci McFist]] and is even willing to put up with his aggressive and boisterous son [[Bash Johnson]] for her.\n\n==Appearance==\nHannibal is stocky with blond hair. He is almost bald and has a handle-bar mustache. He wears a brown business suit, blacks shoes, and red tie with a neck tie pin. He also has a mechanical arm with a brain in it; the arm seems to have a mind of its own and sometimes doesn't work too well. It is unknown if he lost his arm in an accident or removed it on purpose, although \"McOne Armed and Dangerous\" suggests that he might've lost it in an accident with a conveyor belt.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n* '''Robot Arm:''' McFist has a cybernetic arm with a brain in it; the arm seems to have a mind of its own and sometimes doesn't work too well. In one episode it destroyed a computer screen in one punch, suggesting it has inhuman strength. In [[Escape from Scrap City|another episode]], it was modified with a blaster finger that shoots lasers. In [[Club Ninja-dise]], McFist\u2019s arm was modified with a retractable sword arm and a parachute when he dressed up as a pirate.\n\n* '''Lucius O'ThunderPunch Suit:''' Vicroy once built a large high-tech robotic suit which was part of a plan to upstage the Ninja and win the public's affection, to raise the people's morale, only to leave them emotionally distraught when they later realized they had chosen the wrong hero, which would allow the Sorcerer to stank them. After the Ninja fought against the stanked monsters, he confronted Lucius, and was was able to steal back the \"Ninja of the Year\" plaque, destroying it as the object most dear to the people and thus reverting them to normal. \"O'Thunderpunch\" flew away after losing the public's respect.\n\n==Role in the series==\nHannibal McFist, the series' secondary antagonist and the owner CEO and Owner of McFist Industries (which manufactures a wide variety of products), is described as a \"Global Gazillionaire\" and is the most \"beloved man\" appearing a wealthy philanthropist. However, McFist is secretly obsessed with gaining more power, and along with his mad scientist [[Willem Viceroy|Viceroy]], he continually plots to kill the Ninja, through a variety of robots and traps. But the world is not enough for McFist. The one thing he wants more than anything is a superpower. So he made a deal: if McFist helps [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]]\u00a0break out of his hole of a prison, the Sorcerer will reward McFist with the superhuman ability of his choosing.\n\nIn the episode \"[[McOne Armed and Dangerous]]\", [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]] managed to unmask McFist for the villain he was; however, this led him to be overcome with sadness at having lost everything. And thus he became vulnerable to the Sorcerer's [[Stank|evil magic]], turning McFist into a monster. Enraged, he attacked Randy to get revenge. Realizing that provoking his enemy was a mistake, Randy managed to turn McFist back to normal and covered up his evil acts by claiming he had always been possessed with the evil.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Willem Viceroy]]===\nMcFist can be impatient towards Viceroy and his work. He takes credit for all of Viceroy's successes and blames him for any failures, sometimes even his own.\n\nAlthough he tried to use the robot mantis in \"[[Monster Drill]]\", he failed miserably, so he begrudgingly asked Viceroy to do it, even if it meant giving him a longer break. McFist had a Robo-Ape apologize for him to Viceroy for succeeding with the \"Mexican Death Bear,\" although he banned him from Whoopee World once the Ninja won. McFist does get tired of Viceroy being unable to destroy the Ninja, and often yells at him. But sometimes he can be the cause for the mess-ups, as in \"[[Nukid on the Block]]\", where his impatience resulted in breaking the computer and trying to save Franz as opposed to listening to Viceroy on the matter. In \"[[Grave Puncher: The Movie!]]\" upon preparing to watch the movie, Viceroy placed his leg next to Hannibal's touching it, and Hannibal moved his leg away quickly, stating that he does not like it.\n\n===[[Marci McFist]]===\nMcFist will attempt to do anything to make sure Marci, his wife, is happy. When he and Viceroy were about to activate the doomsday device in \"[[Night of the Living McFizzles]]\", he was terrified when he realized that he left Marci behind, and tried to stop it, which accidentally broke it. He also does anything to please her, like get the largest Christmas tree in \"[[Silent Punch, Deadly Punch]]\", or help Bash with his science project in \"[[Attack of the Killer Potatoes]]\". She also knows about his desire to destroy the Ninja, and actually supports him in it. They love each other very much, and have a surprisingly good marriage. He was even willing to work with the Ninja, whom he detests, in order to save her in \"[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]\".\n\n===[[Bash Johnson]]===\nHannibal doesn't deeply care for his stepson Bash and considers him a distraction because he always causes trouble.\n\nHowever, McFist deals with him to make Marci happy. He only acts affectionate toward him in order to pacify Marci. During the Bash Splash, McFist was asked to put some sunscreen on him by Marci, which he did, not pleasing Bash. At Howard's comment at Bash not being a jerk, McFist is annoyed. He has Viceroy build a machine for Bash's project in the Science Fair, which wins them only a \"C.\" But when Bash is about to be killed in \"Bash Johnson: 11th Grade Ninja,\" McFist appears shocked (though perhaps only for Marci's sake) and tries to stop the Robo-Apes from rampaging \u2014 to no avail.\n\n===[[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|The Sorcerer]]===\nThe Sorcerer has made a deal with McFist: if he destroys the Ninja, then he'll get to choose a superpower once the Sorcerer escapes. Nevertheless, McFist still finds him scary, hiding from him in \"[[McFists of Fury]]\" after having failed. He also is annoyed with how obsessed the Sorcerer is with the Ninja's demise in \"[[Randy Cunningham: 13th Century Ninja]]\", and he opines that at least a \"thank-you\" from the Sorcerer would've been nice in \"[[On the Poolfront]]\".\n\n===[[Randy Cunningham]]/Norrisville Ninja===\nMcFist has interacted with not-on-Ninja-business Randy only in \"House of 1,000 Boogers,\" when he suggested that he should try McFissues. He also sits next to Randy in \"Grave Puncher: The Movie!\".\n\nAs for the Ninja, McFist loathes him, doing everything he can to destroy him and earn the Sorcerer's reward, though in front of the public, he acts as if he loves the Ninja. In \"McFists of Fury\", Randy finds out he's the cause for the robot attacks and vows to tell everyone about him, but changes his mind when he sees how much that would distress everyone in Norrisville. In \"Silent Punch, Deadly Punch,\" McFist doesn't understand why the Ninja is taking sap from his Christmas tree, but is unable to stop him due to the people around, and later sends Robo-Elves to attack him, saying the robots have gone crazy. McFist accidentally reveals his true nature, in part due to Randy's goading, in \"McOne Armed and Dangerous\", but after McFist gets stanked and goes on a monster rampage, Randy saves his reputation by claiming the situation was a misunderstanding.\n\nOften, McFist and Viceroy have come close to finding out the Ninja's identity, but interference by Randy and Howard ends up preventing them. In \"Bash Johnson: 11th Grade Ninja,\" he is ecstatic that the Ninja's identity had been found out, but when he sees it's Bash, it shocks him. He thanks Randy for saving Bash before yelling that he should stay around to be destroyed, which Randy obviously declines. In \"Raiders of the Lost Nomicon,\" McFist finally captures Randy and is about to get his reward from the Sorcerer, until Randy, using the lessons he had already learned in previous episodes, escapes. In \"[[Secret Stache]]\", McFist came extremely close to figuring out Randy's identity as the ninja, but Randy's profuse facial hair prevented McFist from knowing who the ninja was.\n\nIn a few instances, though, McFist has reluctantly teamed up with the Ninja. In order to save Marci and Bash in \"Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes,\" McFist accepts Randy's help and eventually agrees to Randy's solution of apologizing to the Robo-Apes. When the Shark-Dermanator comes after McFist and Viceroy for revenge in \"Flume-Igation,\" McFist awkwardly finds himself having to cheer the Ninja on so that he'll be saved. Sometimes, McFist has actually been a bit nice to Randy. In \"Fart-Topia\", McFist tells the Ninja that they don't have to fight after just defeating Terry and the Tick-Bot, and they can fight another time.\n\n===[[Howard Weinerman]]===\nAlthough interacting with Howard many times, McFist has yet to make the connection between Howard and the Ninja. McFist captures Howard in \"Gossip Boy\" to find out the Ninja's secret identity, threatening to torture him, but when Howard shows no sign of knowing the Ninja on the mind reader, McFist simply lets him go. They see each other again in \"House of 1,000 Boogers\", where Howard says Bash wasn't a jerk. Although McFist doesn't know it, if Howard hadn't intervened in episodes like \"30 Seconds to Math\" and \"Nukid on the Block,\" he might've actually won. He kidnaps Howard again in \"Secret Stache\"; this time, Howard is mistaken for the ninja. McFist gets angry upon realizing that Howard is both not the real ninja and a mustache faker, but the Ninja prevents him from punishing the imposter.\n\nIn \"McSatchl\u00e9,\" Randy and Howard get jobs at McFist's movie theater and McFist is reminded of himself by how Howard treats others. McFist then promotes Howard to manager, but eventually fires him for socializing with the Ninja.\n\n===Robo-Apes===\nMcFist is quite mean to his robots, angrily shouting at them if they fail to defeat the Ninja, and annoyed by their incompetence. His behavior backfires on him when the Robo-Apes, inspired by the Ninja's suggestion to fight back, go on strike in \"Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes\". Things get even worse when McFist stubbornly refuses to say he's sorry for his behavior, which results in the Robo-Apes going into Ape-Mode and attacking Whoopee World. McFist still won't say he's sorry, but finally relents when he sees Marci in danger and the Ninja tells him apologizing is the only way to fix things. Neil Apestrong translates McFist's vow not to yell so much, and the Robo-Apes finally cease attacking.\n\n===Terry McFist===\nTerry is McFist's older brother and the true heir to McFist Industries. Every year, he signs a waiver allowing McFist to run the company and its subsidiaries. In \"Fart-Topia,\" McFist seems annoyed with his brother's easygoing personality, and when Terry takes over McFist Industries but struggles, McFist makes fun of him by pretending to be their father and scolding him. Even though he's deeply irritated by Terry, McFist begrudgingly admits that Terry is special in his own way, albeit shouting at him to sign the document afterwards.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is seen in \"[[Last Stall on the Left]]\" and \"[[Randy Cunningham: 13th Century Ninja]]\" that the brain in his wrist can control his right arm.\n*In the tumblr post for his concept art, vazgeuez states that he imagined him to be \"former military\" and that the brain in his arm was originally a fish, not monkey.\n*He states that he likes watching [[Heidi Weinerman|Heidi]]'s Gossip Reports because she always has the details. (He was seen watching them in \"[[Gossip Boy]]\" and \"[[Night of the Living McFizzles]]\").\n*He owns a painting that looks very much like Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\"; behind that painting is his safe.\n*The brain in his right arm is actually a monkey brain.\n*He is dressed in a Santa Claus costume for his Christmas party in \"[[Silent Punch, Deadly Punch]]\".\n*He buys Howard's father's company in \"Silent Punch, Deadly Punch.\"\n**Later, he temporarily hires Mort to build robots for him when Viceroy's creations keep getting defeated.\n*He values Marci more than anything in the world, as revealed in \"Night of the Living McFizzles\", and in \"[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]\", he is even willing to work with the Ninja, whom he hates, to save her.\n*He used to go to Norrisville High in 1985 as revealed in \"[[Secret Stache]]\", His age and grade during that year is unknown.\n**He was also the founding father of the Norrisville High Mustache Society.\n*No one in Norrisville has actually noticed that McFist is a villain yet.\n**The only people who know about his being a villain so far, besides Marci and Viceroy, are Randy (who is the Norrisville Ninja) and Howard.\n**In \"McOne Armed and Dangerous\", Randy reveals McFist's treachery to the public, causing the town to boycott McFist Industries. However, when McFist gets stanked and attacks the Ninja, Randy realizes that he was wrong, and ends up telling everyone that there was a misunderstanding.\n*It's rare for him to have an indoor voice because he yells a lot.\n*How McFist met the Sorcerer or came to hate the Ninja is unknown.\n*Hannibal has coulrophobia, the fear of clowns, as seen in \"[[McFear Factor]]\".\n*For how many times McFist has seen Howard, which is more than seeing Randy outsite the suit, he hasn't gotten suspicious of him.\n**However, when he sees Howard bossing fellow employees in \"[[McSatchl\u00e9]]\", he says that Howard reminded him of himself, calling him \"young Hannibal.\"\n*He is similar to Lex Luthor from''DC Comics''. They are both rich and powerful business men, they practically own everything in their respective cities, and they secretly plot to destroy their respective enemies.\n*In \"[[Let the Wonk One In]]\" he is revealed to be creeped out by novelty Halloween music.\n*He is left-handed, as seen in \"[[Randy Cunningham's Day Off]]\".\n*The voice of McFist, John DiMaggio, is also the voice of [[Dr. Drakken]], the main villain from ''[[Kim Possible]]'', as well as [[Fu Dog]] from ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'', Jake the Dog from ''Adventure Time'' and Bender from ''Futurama''.\n*Despite being one of the three main villains of the series, McFist has appeared in only 64 of the 100 episodes, appearing without Viceroy only once.\n*Despite his calling Marci his wife, neither of them are ever seen wearing wedding rings.\n*His safe combination is 46234414.\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McFist, Hannibal}}\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Stepparents]]"
