She first appears in Season 1<ref name=\"tell\">[[Fu and Tell]]</ref>, and makes her only other appearance in Season 2<ref name=\"switch\">[[Switcheroo]]</ref>.\n==History==\nShe is [[Haley Long|Haley]]'s arch-rival who always brings her rare, award-winning cat Miss Tinkles (aka [[Yan Yan]]) to show-and-tell and ends up getting all the attention every time.\n==Personality==\nOlivia Mears is a pesky little girl who will stop at nothing to get everyone's attention. She is very cocky and snobbish, and likes to brag about her accomplishments and gifted abilities. She will not hesitate to resort to foul play in order to get what she wants. She also uses intimidation and looks at others from up-high to keep anyone from challenging her. Olivia is an overall competitive and mean little girl that wants to be perfect in every way in the eyes of adults.\n==Relation with Haley Long==\nOlivia considers Haley her rival in her goal to become as perfect as she can be and will stop at nothing to be better than her. One time, she openly insults [[Fu Dog]] and insists that she is the best at show-and-tell<ref name=\"tell\">[[Fu and Tell]]</ref>. Another time, she keeps dissing Haley in order to get her morale down, although this kind of intimidation simply infuriates Haley<ref name=\"switch\">[[Switcheroo]]</ref>. Olivia is not afraid to get into trouble or to physically hurt others, as shown when she purposely trips Haley (although it was [[Jake]] in his sister's body at the time) during a dance audition right into the piano.\n\n==Quotes==\n===In [[Fu and Tell]]===\n*''\"Sorry I'm late.
