Kat Nipp is an often-drunk countryside tough guy who is a rival of [[Mickey Mouse]]. He is similar to [[Pete]].\n\nNipp made his debut in the [[1929]] animated short ''[[The Opry House]]'', in which he posed as a snake for a snake-charming act\u2014continuing to smoke his pipe all the while. Nipp's other two appearances in animation also came in 1929, with ''[[When the Cat's Away]]'' and ''[[The Karnival Kid]]''. The latter film introduced Nipp's habit of physically abusing Mickey, hereby stretching out Mickey's nose to a ridiculous length.\n\nKat Nipp reappeared in a [[1931]] sequence of the ''Mickey Mouse'' newspaper comic strip, \"Mickey Mouse vs. Kat Nipp\". Katt Nipp was redesigned to be short, presumably to distinguish him from Pete. In the story, Mickey starts intruding around Kat Nipp's house, taking his signs warning trespassers to be wary of his wrath as a challenge. Angered that Mickey ignored his signs, Kat Nipp retaliates by continually tying Mickey's tail in knots. Mickey vows to not untie said knots until he gets even with Kat Nipp. Kat Nipp was also used in the strips produced in Britain for the ''Mickey Mouse Annual''. However, the character quickly faded away and has made only a handful of appearances in comics since the mid-1930s.\n\nIn [[2019]], Kat Nipp appeared in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', being featured as a background character in a mini-game inspired by ''The Karnival Kid''.\n\n== Personality ==\n\nIn the comics, Kat Nipp is a grouch who is territorial and dislikes unwelcome visitors by his house. According to recent comics, he was once in jail for an unknown crime. Despite this, Katt Nipp is only antagonistic if provoked, and with the exception of Mickey, is friendly to the other citizens of Mouseton.\n\n==Filmography==\n*''[[The Opry House]]''\n*''[[When the Cat's Away]]'' (as Tom Cat)\n*''[[The Karnival Kid]]''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMickeyMeetsKatNipp.jpg|Mickey confronts Kat Nipp in the comic strip storyline ''Mickey Mouse vs. Kat Nipp''.\nKat Nipp.jpg|Kat Nipp ties Mickey's tail in a knot.\nWHEN THE CAT'S AWAY 1.png\nTumblr lic26kxsU31qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr nk37ebIIb31r3jmn6o2 1280.png\nkat-nipp-opry.png\nKatNipp_More_Recent_Appearance_1.PNG\nKatNipp_More_Recent_Appearance_2_ft_BBs.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n== Notes ==\n* There is a picture of Mickey in his wagon home in ''[[The Karnival Kid]]''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nipp, Kat}}\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
