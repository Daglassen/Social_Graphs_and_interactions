He appears to have a rivalry with [[Jumba Jookiba|Dr. Jumba Jookiba]] as they are both evil scientists. He gives the word to his mutant Greemas to have [[Stitch|Experiment 626]] eliminated as he believes that by killing 626, he will be proving himself better than Jumba.\n\nLater on, 626 finds him in his lair. He is the first boss that 626 battles in game. He takes on 626 inside a giant robot but is soon defeated when 626 throws small rockets at the robot. Habbitrale escapes into space inside a giant hamster ball.\n\nHe appears again at the end of the game where he's still floating in space.It's unknown if he survived or not.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dr. Habbitrale strongly resembles [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel]], so it is likely that they are the same species. H\u00e4msterviel could also be based on Habbitrale, as ''[[Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626]]'' (Habbitrale's debut) was released a year before ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' (H\u00e4msterviel's debut).\n*Unlike H\u00e4msterviel, Habbitrale has no tail, although this may be because it is hidden under his clothing.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nDr-Habitrail-1.png\nDr-Habitrail-2.png|Taking a drink from his water bottle\nDr-Habitrail-3.png|\"Deal with him!\"\nDr-Habitrail's-Defeat.png|Habbitrale's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Habbitrale, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
