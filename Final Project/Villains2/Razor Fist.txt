His codename comes from the blade attached to his arm. He works for the [[Ten Rings]] as one of their main agents.\n\nRazor Fist was created by Doug Moench and Gene Day.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*It's unknown if Razor Fist was \"blipped\".\n*In the comic books, Razor Fist had both hands replaced with simple blades, which made life doing anything apart from hand-to-hand combat nigh-impossible for him without help, which is why the MCU version has a blade in only one hand.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings - Razor Fist.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Shang-Chi characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]"
