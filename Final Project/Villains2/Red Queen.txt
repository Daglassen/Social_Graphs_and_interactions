She is the tyrannical queen of [[Underland]] and possesses a bloodthirsty personality, commonly sentencing people and animals to be beheaded for the most ordinary of situations. She maintains a difficult relationship with her younger sister, the [[White Queen|Mirana the White Queen]].\n\nOther incarnations of the Lewis Carroll character have also appeared before, although in rather minor roles, and for simplicity's sake are also covered on this page.\n\n==Background==\n===Development===\nScreenwriter [[Linda Woolverton]] created Iracebeth by fusing two different characters from Lewis Carroll's stories, the Queen of Hearts from the original ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and the Red Queen from its sequel ''Through the Looking-Glass''. When asked about the decision of fusing the characters to create just one, Woolverton explained:\n\n{{Quote|Cos we need one villain. I learnt that from [[Howard Ashman]], the late, great, who I wrote ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' with. He wrote the lyrics. He taught me a lot. And he said why have two average characters when you can have one great character? Put these two together and make one great character, and [[Helena Bonham Carter|she]] does an amazing job.|Linda Woolverton}}\n\nThis is not new to Disney adaptations of Caroll's works; the [[Queen of Hearts]] of the 1951 animated feature was also based in part on the Red Queen (notably saying some lines originally spoken by the Red Queen in the book).\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nEver since [[Alice Kingsleigh]] first left [[Underland]], the Horovendoush occurred and the Red Queen had overthrown her sister, the [[White Queen]], and took control of Underland. Her right-hand man is [[the Knave of Hearts]]. She has an army of [[Armoured Cards]], [[Frog Servants]], [[Monkey Servants]], and a very bad temper. The Red Queen was so paranoid, she even had her husband executed, believing he would leave her for the White Queen. She was often referred to as Bloody Big Head, possibly because all her power, which she stole, literally went to her head.\n\nHer rule was harsh for all of Underland. Those that opposed her rule were hunted down and executed. Even her most loyal advisers feared her so greatly that they would deform themselves with fake noses and ears just so she would not punish them for being more attractive than she was. However, she does show affection for Knave of Hearts (this romance, however, is one-sided).\n\nOn Griblig Day, the Red Queen screams out in anger that someone had stolen three of her tarts. After finding out it was one of her Frog-Footmen, he is later to be executed. The Queen informs a Fish-Footman to choke the frog's children so she can eat them on a meal with caviar. She is informed by the Knave of Hearts that Alice has returned to Underland, the Red Queen assigns Bayard Hamar, the Bloodhound, to pursue Alice for his imprisoned wife and pups, and his own freedom.\n\nLater, the Red Queen sees an oversized Alice in her garden, and to avoid suspicion, Alice tells the Queen her name is Um from Umbridge and that people make fun of her height. The Queen accepts Alice's story and welcomes her to her court. Alice soon finds herself at the Red Queen's side and the Mad Hatter's trail, which eventually the Red Queen is persuaded by Tarrant to become her hatter.\n\nThe next morning while Tarrant is hatting the Red Queen, she hears the news about how the Knave had advanced towards Alice. The Knave attempts to lie on how it's Um (Alice) that's obsessed with him, which the Queen believes and orders the capture of Um. Alice returns to Tarrant and Mallymkun but right away is charged of seduction. However, Alice manages to escape with the Vorpal sword.\n\nOn the day of Tarrant and Mallymkun's execution, the executor severs Tarrant's head but his body disappears with only the hat floating in the air. Tarrant was substituted by Chessur and the real Hatter is up with the Red Queen. Tarrant reveals that all of the Red Queen's followers are phonies and Tarrant makes a speech for all those willing to rebel against the Bloody Bighead to rise and escape to the White Queen's side. In retaliation, the Red Queen orders the release of the Jubjub Bird which terrorizes the people. Tarrant manages to escape with Mallymkun, the Tweedles, Nivens, and Bayard's wife and pups, and the Cheshire cat returns his hat and asks Alice how her arm is. The Red Queen then tells the Knave to prepare the Jabberwock for battle as it is time to visit her sister.\n\nFrabjous day has finally arrived with both Red Queen and White Queen's armies prepared for the epic battle. Alice dons the armor and Vorpal sword. Both armies arrive at a chessboard-like battlefield for the battle between Alice and the Jabberwock.\n\nAfter the Jabberwock is slain, the Red Queen orders her troops to kill Alice but they no longer follow her since the death of the Jabberwock. Chessur crowns the White Queen as once again the queen of Underland. The White Queen banishes the Red Queen to the Outlands along with the Knave. The Knave, unable to live with the Red Queen, attempts to kill her but is quickly stopped by Tarrant, and both the Red Queen and The Knave are carried off of battle field.\n\n[[Helena Bonham Carter]]'s portrayal of the Red Queen was nominated for Best Villain at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, which is chosen by fans.\n\n===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===\nAfter Alice steals the Chronosphere and travels back in time, the Red Queen urges Time to go after Alice and have him bring back the Chronosphere. Alice attempts to go back to the Horovendoush day when the Jabberwocky attacked Witzend but is caught up to by Time and accidentally flies to the day of Iracebeth's coronation.\n\nAt the coronation, a younger Tarrant begins a mockery of the Red Queen when the royal crown doesn't fit on her abnormal head. This causes Iracebeth to have a meltdown, and her father deems her too inappropriate to rule Underland, and passes the title of queen to her younger sister Mirana, the White Queen.\n\nDuring another one of Alice's time traveling instances, on the Fell day, it is revealed that a young Mirana steals a tart from her mother and eats it, leaving the crumbs under Iracebeth's bed. When consulted on the issue by their mother, Mirana lies about eating the tart, and Iracebeth is unfairly accused, causing her to run out of the castle in sadness. Alice sees her about to run into a clock, the event that deforms her head and personality. She is able to get the clock out of her head's way, but fails to change the past as Iracebeth trips and slams her head anyways.\n\nThe Hatter, Alice and the rest of the Underlanders all go to the Red Queen's organic castle in the outlands, where they believe Tarrant's family to be. The Hatter finds his family to be shrunk and trapped in an ant farm. Prepared for their arrival after being informed by Time, Iracebeth apprehends them and steals the Chronosphere from Alice, taking Mirana back to the day she lied about the tart.\n\nWhen Iracebeth and her past self see each other as Iracebeth attempts to stop Mirana from lying, time becomes irrelevant, and Underland begins to freeze. Using the Chronosphere, Alice, the Hatter, Mirana, and a frozen Iracebeth race back to the present, where Alice only just is able to place the Chronosphere back in its original place.\n\nWith the Chronosphere stabilized, Underland reverts back to normal. Mirana apologizes to Iracebeth for lying, and both of them make amends. In one of the 2D animated scenes which was shown during the credits, both Iracebeth and Mirana are seens drinking tea but have a funny lite for their crown.\n\n===''[[Adventures in Wonderland]]''===\nThe Red Queen appeared in the series, portrayed by [[Armelia McQueen]]. The Red Queen is Wonderland's sole monarch. She is strict but fair, often citing her mother and grandmother's example in her ruling. Unfortunately, the Queen is occasionally a source of trouble, usually due to her selfish attitude. As queen, she expects to get whatever she wants right away, and often pouts when things go wrong - often to the point where she says \"Oh harumph!\" She usually ends up eating crow by the end of the episode, but sometimes, she offers solutions to problems other Wonderland residents face. Deep down, she cares greatly for her subjects (especially the White Rabbit), throwing them parties and celebrating their accomplishments. Instead of white, she is black.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===\n[[File:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x01 - Down the Rabbit - Photography - Red Queen.png|thumb|250px|Anastasia as the Red Queen.]]\nAnastasia better known as the Red Queen, is one of the two main antagonists in the [[ABC]] show ''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland'' and she is played by Emma Rigby.\n\nAnastasia is born to an unnamed father and mother, and she has at least two sisters. One of these sisters marries a prince, and gains much favoritism from their mother for it. As for Anastasia, her mother expects her beauty and charm to earn her a chance to become queen or possibly choose a nobleman as a husband. But instead she falls in in love with a dashing thief, [[Will Scarlet]], and the two later live together in Sherwood Forest.\n\nSharing a mutual dream to cross realms, Will joins the Merry Men and persuades them to break into the Dark Sorceress [[Forbidden Mountain|Maleficent's Castle]] to steal gold for the kingdom's people. When they agree, Will hurries home to tell Anastasia, and shortly thereafter, heads into the castle with the Merry Men, where he secretly pilfers a looking glass. During the night, he returns to an awaiting Anastasia. Once Will throws the looking glass onto the floor, it opens a portal. He prompts her on where they should go, to which Anastasia excitedly decides on going to [[Wonderland]]. Holding hands, they then prepare to jump into the portal.\n\nMoments later, Anastasia's mother walks in on them and accosts her daughter for throwing away a life of privilege for a common thief. Anastasia retort that Will makes her happy, because she loves Will and he loves her. She questions why her mother can't see that and be happy for her. Coldly, her mother warns her that love is not enough to build a life, and that when Anastasia learns this lesson she will not be allowed to return to her home, unless she is willing to be her chamber pot maid. She also states that at least her other sister won't be such an embarrassing disappointment. Anastasia, in tears due to her mother's harsh words, is consoled by Will, who promises to build a life for her. He proclaims his true love for her, and that she doesn't need to become a different person or ever return to her mother's household. Bidding her mother farewell, Anastasia turns away to link hands with Will to disappear into the portal, to Wonderland and a better life with her Will.\n\n[[File:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x03 - Forget Me Not - Leaving for Wonderland.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Will and Anastasia leave for Wonderland.]]\nIn Wonderland, the lovers end up finding life much harder than they thought. Despite having their love for one another, the two end up living in a wagon and constantly scrounging for food. While looking for berries, a carriage with the smell of baked goods passes by. Realizing the food is for the upcoming royal ball, the pair pilfer clothes and forge invitations into the castle. As Will goes to steal food, Anastasia hears a socialite's casual use of the word \"darling\" in conversation. Mimicking the woman's manner of speech, she coyly greets a nearby man, who reveals himself as the Red King. While they develop a good rapport and share a drink, guards haul out Will due to his forged invitation, and Anastasia, too, is thrown out after being called out for wearing a stolen gown.\n\nOutside, Will shows her the bread he nabbed, stating that they have food for at least a month. While Will begins to head back to their wagon, Anastasia, before following him, takes a longing look at the castle balcony. When their circumstances become grim, she suggests stealing the royal jewels and selling them once they leave Wonderland for another realm. Convinced by her that they are poor, need money and have no future in Wonderland, Will consents and they form a plan for the heist.\n\nWhile Will waits under the castle balcony for her to throw down the goods, Anastasia breaks into a cabinet to bag the jewels. In distraction, she examines a red crown, to which the Red King catches her. Despite Anastasia's insistence it would matter little if some of his jewels are stolen, he criticizes her for stealing since hierarchy dictates who has or doesn't have wealth. Anastasia hands back the crown, though he offers to gift it to her if she marries him. She hesitates, thinking of her love for Will, until the Red King notes that love won't get someone far and is never enough. Choosing wealth over love, she accepts the proposal and later strolls out to the balcony, garbed in a lascivious new outfit topped off with the red crown, to greet the adoring public as their new Queen. Her eyes meet Will's hurt glance, but then she pretends not to see him and carries on.\n\nAnastasia finds adjusting to life in the palace slightly difficult. When introduced to [[Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum|The Tweedles]] she politely asks their names, but she is corrected by the two. They have no names since they are merely servants. She also is formally introduced to [[Queen of Hearts|Cora, the Queen of Hearts]], and the two develop a good rapport almost instantly, Cora contrasting her favorably to [[The Evil Queen|Regina]] her disappointment of a daughter. Cora uses magic to Anastasia's surprise. Noticing Anastasia's interest, Cora offers to take her under her wing, and teach her the ways of magic. Anastasia however passes, noting that the Red King believes such powers create to great a separation between the Crown and the people. Cora, though a tad disappointed offers Anastasia her friendship. She also let's her know that the door is always open if she ever wishes to learn magic.\n\n[[file:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x01 - Down the Rabbit Hole - Jafar and the Red Queen.png|thumb|250px|The Red Queen and [[Jafar]].]]\nAfter ascending the throne, Anastasia becomes known as the Red Queen. Her relationship with the Red King, at this point, is largely unknown except that he began to take on various mistresses. She teams up with a sorcerer named [[Jafar]] to capture a genie, [[Cyrus (Once Upon a Time in Wonderland)|Cyrus]]. She arrives on the cliff by the Boiling Sea to intercept Alice and Cyrus as they declare their love for each other. Her guards begin attacking the two in an attempt to capture them. During the battle, the Red Queen watches indignantly as the twosome defeat her dozen soldiers. However, being outnumbered, Alice and Cyrus are cornered and defeated by her guards. As Alice is held down while Cyrus is dragged away, he breaks free to rescue her. Changing things up, the Red Queen twirls her hand and smiles deviously, using magic to topple Cyrus over the cliff and into the Boiling Sea, as a horrified Alice watches her lover plummet to his death. Fortunately, unknown to Alice, Jafar waits ominously below and catches Cyrus on his magic carpet.\n\nWhen Alice returns to [[Wonderland]], the Red Queen rides out in her coach to meet the [[White Rabbit]]. She demands he come with her, and the two of them go to her castle. Once inside, she asks the Rabbit if he has brought Alice. The Rabbit affirms this to be true. In turn, the Queen orders him to continue to do her bidding, or else he will be turned into furnishing. The rabbit slinks away as the Queen smiles wickedly. Later, she encounters Jafar out on the balcony, and informs him of Alice's arrival and how everything is going as they planned it. Unexpectedly, Jafar begins to question the Queen\u2019s usefulness and uses his magic to begin to choke her. The Queen manages to gasp out that only she knows where Alice is, and he should be wise to remember this. Jafar reluctantly stops choking her, and she flashes him a triumphant smile, reminding him Wonderland is her world, not [[Agrabah]].\n\nFrom the White Rabbit, the Red Queen learns the burial spot of Cyrus' bottle, an item both she and Jafar have been looking for.\n\nAs per her duties to the kingdom, Red Queen sits in the throne room where petitioners bring attention to their plights. However, she expresses boredom at listening to their problems, which causes an uproar from her subjects. Suddenly, the noise ceases as the petitioners are frozen in place. The Red Queen gets up from her throne asking if Jafar is present. Jafar appears and states he does not understand how she can take listening to people all day. The Red Queen responds it's part of the job to juggle responsibilities. He asks if she has made any progress with obtaining the location of the bottle. Coyly, she gives an affirmative response, but has doubts Jafar can do what he says he can do, which is bend the laws of magic.\n\nAs she attempts to walk away from him, Jafar freezes her in place, and coldly asserts he is the one in charge, and the two of them are not involved in a partnership. He removes the freezing spell only from her head and repeats his question about the bottle's location. She manages to gasp out, though it is a lie, that the bottle is now in Mimsy Meadows under the Tum Tum Tree. Believing to have received a proper answer, he removes the spell from her body entirely. On his way out, he chides her to devote more time to their plans. The Red Queen reasons she has responsibilities as a ruler and in response, Jafar frees up her time by turning all her frozen subjects in the room into piles of ash. He callously remarks that her schedule is cleared and strolls out while the Red Queen looks on in horror.\n\nAfterwards, she receives the White Rabbit as a visitor. She questions him further on how he obtained knowledge on the bottle's true burial site. In his recollections, the White Rabbit remembers stumbling on and secretly watching Alice and Cyrus bury the bottle. To the Red Queen, he asks for his freedom after doing everything she has requested. Instead, she gives a strong rebuke and reminds him who is in charge.\n\nThe Red Queen comes triumphantly to find Jafar in his lair interrogating Cyrus, only after he discovered the bottle's location to be false, and admits to withholding the bottle's actual whereabouts as she is tired of him holding all the cards in the deck. As she is now possession of the bottle, the Red Queen turns the tables on Jafar and calls for a change in their relationship; starting with her own promotion from lackey to equal. She leaves him to simmer in humiliation and fury.\n\nWhen she returns to her castle, the Red Queen places the bottle carefully in a box and locks it for safekeeping with a smile.\n\nAfter Anastasia left him for the Red King, Will became the Knave of Hearts when Cora, the Queen of Hearts stole his heart to subject him to her will. When he was freed by Alice, he owed it to her to help her find Cyrus after discovering he survived their encounter with the Red Queen.\n\nThe Red Queen imprisons Knave and belittles him for coming back to Wonderland and whatever Alice, dubbing her his \"girlfriend\", offered him must have been worth the risk. They both trade personal insults at one another until the Red Queen walks away. Jafar approaches her again to order a public execution for Knave so people see what happens to those who align themselves with Alice. She proposes Knave might be more useful alive than dead, but he wonders if she is reluctant to kill him for another reason. He presses her to get the job done to prove she is willing to go to any lengths to get what she wants. Unwilling to resort to murder, the Red Queen forms an escape plan for Knave to leave Wonderland with the White Rabbit. Knave suspects she only wants to catch him while he's leaving as a reason for capital punishment. She, however, wants an excuse not to kill him as her involvement with Jafar makes it difficult to keep him alive. Additionally, this is her way of making up her betrayal to him. Knave doesn't want pity, but she argues that without her support, he'd be dead. He refuses to comply with escaping and blames her for making him a fool because she has committed inexcusable, terrible deeds. The one thing he thinks the Red Queen can't do is kill him, and dares her to try, so she accepts his challenge.\n\nAt Knave's public execution, the Red Queen and Jafar appear over the castle balcony to greet the public masses. Tweedledee notifies them that Alice is in the crowd as well. The Red Queen orders for her to be taken in by the guards, but Jafar thinks it'd be a better idea to see how far Alice is willing to go to save a friend. They watch the procession as Knave is brought out onto the gallows and prepped for the beheading, but Alice rescues him and the two flee by using the catapult machine to fling themselves into the maze. The Red Queen arrives there at the same time as Jafar. As Knave is choked by Jafar, he gasps out Anastasia's name, and is only let go when Alice makes her first wish. Then, Alice herself is tested by Jafar's magic until being dropped. The Red Queen stares in horror as Jafar turns Knave into a stone statue. Afterwards, Alice angrily slaps her for not helping Knave, and moves to deliver another smack, but the Red Queen blocks it with magic. She chides Alice to \"grow up\" and use more common sense. The Red Queen warns that Wonderland is a prison and it's only going to get worse for Alice until she does what must be done. At nightfall, she returns to look, with much longing, at the statue of Knave.\n\n[[File:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x04 - The Serpent - Will and Ana.jpg|thumb|250px|The Red Queen bemoans the Knaves fate.]]\nHoping to restore Knave back to normal, she tricks Alice into helping her procure some magic dust that only someone with a pure heart can obtain. As a reward, she promises to lead Alice to Cyrus. She watches Alice successfully decipher the riddle for reaching the dust, \"the pure of heart shall make the leap\", only for the girl to fall out of sight. Even after that, the Red Queen refuses to budge from the cliff edge. A ground tremor throws her off balance and she, too, drops down into the same cave pit as Alice. A child version of Alice goads the older Alice into exacting revenge on the Red Queen for previously faking Cyrus' death. Though Alice appears to move towards slashing the Red Queen, she stabs her sword into the ground instead. The child Alice congratulates her older self for passing a test and then turns into magic dust. Back outside, Alice refuses to hand over the bag of dust until the Red Queen tells her how to get to Cyrus. So, she takes the bag by force and leaves Alice with nothing. Returning to the maze, the Red Queen sprinkles some of the dust onto Knave. Before he completely unfreezes and sees her, she runs away.\n\nShe comes to search for Jafar in his lair, but only finds Cyrus' empty cage. No matter how much magical force she exerts against Jafar's other prisoner, he refuses to betray the manner of how Cyrus escaped the lair. The Red Queen decides to hunt down Cyrus so she can possess both him and his bottle while strongly reprimanding Tweedledee when he questions her judgment. She follows his tracks to the river, but has doubts Cyrus crossed the stream, and uses magic to show which way he actually went. She corners Cyrus at a cliff, applauding him for the heroic endeavor to reach Alice, but the harsh reality is sometimes love is not enough. Somehow, Cyrus refuses to give up and jumps into the sea.\n\nThe Red Queen is told by Tweedledum that Cyrus has been captured in the forest. She travels on a carriage to force Cyrus to come along with her. The Red Queen makes a stop at an abandoned wagon where she stores various items from her past and present life, including the real bottle. After taking it, she proceeds to drive the carriage down a road and notices her castle in the distance is now on fire, which is obviously Jafar's work. She directs Cyrus to take her to Alice, and questions if he would rather Jafar find his beloved instead. Cyrus perceives that she strongly desires a wish, but the Red Queen remains tight lipped on the matter. They arrive at the Outlands where Cyrus is set free and allowed to go to Alice. After their reunion, the Red Queen makes herself known to both Alice and Knave. She warns them about a dangerous storm cloud Jafar has sent after all of them, and stresses the importance of leaving Wonderland. Alice refuses to go without an explanation for the Red Queen's actions thus far, including her reasons for taking away Cyrus and desiring the bottle. In an emotional outburst, the Red Queen admits to Knave that she wants him back. He stoically recalls a time when she did have his whole heart, but threw it away. She pleads that by breaking the laws of magic, they can go back to the past and resume their relationship, but he wants nothing more to do with her. Even to this, Alice doesn't believe the Red Queen, but Cyrus does, so she asks the White Rabbit to dig a hole to someplace safe for them. As the storm cloud closes in, the Red Queen uses the bottle as a shield against a lightning bolt, which then bounces off and fatally wounds Knave. The Red Queen cradles Knave as he is near death, while Alice begins to die too as her first wish comes into full effect. Knave is given the third remaining wish by Cyrus and uses it to \"end Alice's suffering\". Cyrus' servitude as a genie ends and Alice is revived, though the price is Knave must take his place in the bottle.\n\nThe Red Queen adamantly wants to defeat Jafar to prove herself as the good ruler the people of Wonderland deserve. She and Knave go to the White Rabbit's house while the latter pair head to the Well of Wonders to track down the guardian Nyx, who cursed Cyrus and his brothers to be genies. The Red Queen formally apologizes to the White Rabbit for having taken from him what can never be returned, and asks for help to convince the commoners that she genuinely wants to take back the kingdom for their sake. A bigger problem is posed when the Red Queen receives news that Jafar released the Jabberwocky, however, she stubbornly still wants to wage war against him. While on the move in the woods, she senses the Jabberwocky's presence, orders Knave into the bottle and hides it in the bushes. The Red Queen conjures a sword for protection and stabs the Jabberwocky with it, but the weapon has no effect on her. Powerless to the creature's manipulations, she is quickly knocked out cold and awakens, strapped down to a chair, in the castle jail cell. Across from her, Knave is entrapped in the same dilemma. Jafar orders the Jabberwocky to get inside the Red Queen's head in order to force her to make the three wishes. In a matter of minutes, she collapses emotionally after being goaded about her miserable past and present. When reminded by the Jabberwocky, the Red Queen remembers losing her mother's love, her fears of never regaining Knave's love as well as the empty hole she has from being without love. She is manipulated into making two frivolous wishes; one for her crown and another for her jewels. Lastly, she uses the third wish to make Jabberwocky stop torturing her; causing Knave to return to the bottle and into Jafar's possession. Afterwards, the Red Queen receives a visit from Tweedledee, who is still loyal to her, so she sends him to warn Alice and Cyrus against fighting Jafar and to leave Wonderland immediately.\n\n[[File:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x11 - Heart of the Matter - Anastasia and Will.jpg|thumb|250px|Will and Anastasia share a final kiss.]]\nJafar interrogates the Red Queen for answers, believing she used magic on Knave to render his spell useless, but she denies it. When she challenges him, he magically chokes her until the Jabberwocky has an answer; stating that the Knave is without a heart. Afterward, Jafar threatens to slit the Red Queen's throat unless Knave tells him the location of his heart. Despite that she pleads against it, he complies with Jafar's request, stating his heart has caused him enough suffering and no one needs to die due to it. Later, she expresses surprise that he had his heart taken out, which Knave believes was necessary to forget about her. When asked about her intent to change the past had she broken the laws of magic, the Red Queen admits wanting to keep herself and Will from going to Wonderland. She apologizes for resorting to magic to win him back, as the laws weren't meant to be broken, and asks for his forgiveness, which he accepts. Jafar returns to the dungeon, shoving the heart into Knave, who collapses in shock. Stunned, the Red Queen calls for Knave to look at her. In the instant their eyes meet, they share a kiss until Jafar separates them. Knave is locked up while the Red Queen is pulled out, forced to look at her beloved Will, as Jafar kills her.\n\nOnce the laws of magic are broken, Anastasia is revived by Jafar. Under his magical influence, she believes they are in love and casually drops this bombshell to an entrapped Will; even kissing Jafar passionately in front of him. Visibly subdued, Anastasia has little reaction to Alice being held captive and threatened by Jafar. While lounging on a couch twirling a wine glass, Jafar drops a ring, which Cyrus gave Alice, into Anastasia's glass. Jafar later prompts Anastasia to prove their \"love\" is real by telling him about the Well of Wonders. She informs him that it's a place with water of magical properties. Jafar leaves for the location, intending to kill Amara, though he isn't aware of what she is doing there. While he is gone, Anastasia watches over Alice and Will, though she is easily distracted. She is alarmed upon noticing the White Rabbit attempting to free Alice and becomes defensive when Will suggests that her feelings for Jafar are fake. Eventually, Jafar's magical hold on her is removed once she and Will share a kiss of true love. Happily, she unbinds Alice, allowing the girl to travel through a rabbit hole to the Well of Wonders, where Jafar is enslaved as genie for trying to steal water from Nyx.\n\nThe laws of magic are reversed, freeing Will and Cyrus' brothers. But this act come with tragic results for Anastasia, who without Jafar's sorcery to sustain her, dies once more to Will's horror. Luckily, Alice states to Will that she can be revived, as Cyrus restorers her life with water from the Well of Wonders. Though Will is frightened of the consequences at first, Cyrus insists that their shall be none, as this water is not stolen but gifted by Nyx, since it is not yet her time to pass on. Her life restored Anastasia happily reunites with her True Love, Will Scarlet.\n\n[[File:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x13 - And They Lived... - Will and Ana at Wedding.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anastasia and Will at Alice and Cyrus' wedding.]]\nSometime later she and Will are among the guests from Wonderland at Alice and Cyrus' wedding in England. The two happily watch as their companions finally take their vows, with Anastasia putting a stop to Will's attempt at light-hearted foolishness during the ceremony. As Percy reopens the rabbit hole to return the denizens of Wonderland home, she insists to Alice and Cyrus that the four of them won't say goodbye, but rather see you soon. The Queen, who once was their enemy, now parts ways with them as their friend. Will and Anastasia make their return to Wonderland and assume their new roles as fair and benevolent rulers, The White Queen and White King.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[White Queen]]===\nGrowing up with her younger sister Mirana, later know as the White Queen, Iracebeth seemed not to show her future evil personality to her family. It is possible that she was not evil while a child (Mirana once said that Iracebeth \"wasn't always that way\"), but she left small clues of her greedy obsession of rulling over all of Underland while still growing up. For example, while her sister chose to study how to Produce Medicinal Cures and Potions, Iracebeth preferred to study Dominion Over Living Things.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her appearance in the Tim Burton live-action movies is heavily based on depiction of Queen Elizabeth the First of England.\n*She is a combination of the Red Queen, the Duchess and the Queen of Hearts from Lewis Carroll's novels.\n**On a related note in the [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|1951 film]], several of the Red Queen's lines are given to the [[Queen of Hearts]], despite the Red Queen herself being a separate character who did not appear in this film.\n*The ''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland'' version of the character is heavily inspired by [[Anastasia Tremaine]].\n\n==External Links==\n*{{OUAT}}\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{Disney Villains}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[ru:\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]"
