It is said that she favored [[Ursula]] more than [[Morgana]], her other daughter, who always sought her approval. She was given a slightly expanded role in the Special Edition, when Morgana elaborates on her motives and backstory (\"[[Gonna Get My Wish]]\").\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is mentioned she loved Ursula more than Morgana, possibly due to the fact that Ursula was better at [[magic]].\n*The family portrait listed \"first place\", implying that her family won some sort of competition.\n*The existence of Ursula and Morgana's mother indicates that the deleted scene of Triton being Ursula's brother was rendered non-canon with ''Return to the Sea'', due to their mother being an [[Octopid]] instead of a [[Merpeople|mermaid]].\n*In the ''[[Descendants]]'' franchise, she has a granddaughter named [[Uma]].\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Cephalopods]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Octopus]]"
