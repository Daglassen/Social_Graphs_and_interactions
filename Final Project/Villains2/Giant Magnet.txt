(<u>'''T'''</u>ower\u00a0<u>'''C'''</u>rane), and the climax main antagonist of\u00a0''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]''.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Giant Magnet is the final antagonist in\u00a0the film. He appears near the end of the film\u00a0when the main characters are sent to Ernie's Disposal, an automotive junkyard. During the song \"[[Worthless]]\", the Giant\u00a0Magnet mercilessly kills nine\u00a0of the [[Junkyard Cars]], one by one,\u00a0picking them up and dropping them onto a conveyor belt leading to a [[Crusher]], which crushes them into tiny cubes, while [[Toaster]] and his fellow appliances try to find cover from the Giant Magnet. Unlike the Junkyard Cars, he doesn't have any expressions aside from a permanent scowl (and a confused look, briefly).\n\nBeing a cold and uncaring machine created to destroy, the Giant Magnet shows no sympathy for his victims and has no regrets about killing them. Although the Magnet is simply performing his job, like [[Elmo St. Peters]], to destroy the cars, he later\u00a0chases the\u00a0appliances, deliberately picking up every object (or more)\u00a0they hide under. When [[Rob McGroarty|the Master]] arrives at Ernie's Disposal to retrieve his appliances, he grabs onto all of them (except Toaster) without noticing the Magnet removing his face and chasing him, picks them up, being lifted into the air and dropped onto the conveyor belt along with them. As they are about to be killed by the crusher, Toaster jumps into the workings of the machine, using his own body to jam its gears. Crusher is disabled just in time, and the Toaster is repaired by the Master.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Giant Magnet.png\nTheGiantMagnet.jpg|The Giant Magnet with Sedan\nFemaleJunkCar.jpg|The Giant Magnet with Convertible\nFile:MissouriJunkCar.jpg|The Giant Magnet with T.C., Crusher, and Corvette\nKgd2_big.png\nbrave-little-toaster-disneyscreencaps.com-9623.jpg|The Giant Magnet with Toaster, Lampy, Radio, and Blanky\nbrave-little-toaster-disneyscreencaps.com-9624.jpg|The Giant Magnet with Kirby and his gang\nBrave-little-toaster-disneyscreencaps.com-9702.jpg|The Giant Magnet with Crusher\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Brave Little Toaster}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:The Brave Little Toaster characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
