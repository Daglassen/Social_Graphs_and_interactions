Pasha is a character in Breath of the Wild.


== Biography ==
Pasha is a young Gerudo who attends Ashai's classes in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to Pasha while she is walking around Gerudo Town, she complains about how busy she is with Ashai's classes. Stating that she is very tired, Pasha politely asks Link to talk with someone else.
Link can find Pasha sleeping during Ashai's relationship class during the day. If Link speaks to her, she will wake up and swears that she was not sleeping. Pasha then says that she has always dreamed of living an adventurous life and then finding her true love. Pasha believes that she will have a child and live happily with her true love, which drives her motivation for attending the relationship class. During the class, Ashai asks the class what to do when a "handsome voe" approaches them on the street. Pasha is the first to stand up and share her solution, saying that she would wave casually yet remain prepared in case he is a distraction for a bandit ambush. Ashai praises Pasha for her solution and then reminds the class that sometimes men only look suspicious from being intimidated of a Gerudo. 
If Link speaks to Pasha while she is attending Ashai's cooking class at night, she talks about how people crave home cooking. Pasha explains that it is sometimes better to make a quick meal with few ingredients instead of something elaborate and comments to herself that she should write that down.
