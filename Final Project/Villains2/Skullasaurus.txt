Everyone assumed it had kidnapped [[Christopher Robin]] and taken him to the [[Skull Cave (Winnie the Pooh)|Skull Cave]], but this was proved to be false, where Christopher Robin went to school and Owl read the note incorrectly. At the Upside Down Rock, [[Rabbit]] reads the curse chant on the map saying, \"The upside down rock. If you've made it this far, you're where monsters are.\" which is the curse has upon and heard of the howl in distant. Upon hearing the creature's roars again, Christopher Robin explains that they are only the growls of Pooh's stomach.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Skullasaurus is rumored to be a dinosaur, or a demon, but it is only a figment of the group's imagination.\n**On a side note, his name could probably mean, literally, \"Skull Lizard\".\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
